"It's a shame that this movie is usually snubbed by shoving it into the \"action\" category. Sure, there are lot of legendary action sequences to be found, but RoboCop is a LOT more than that. Next time when you watch it, try to shift your focus from the cyborgs, explosions and gore towards the writing. From the main theme of criticizing the modern money driven society (a topic still relevant today, and will most likely be so in the future as well) all the way to the smallest bits of dialogue, the writing is nothing short of outstanding. RoboCop is simply the most intelligent \"action\" film to come out of Hollywood, ever. Unfortunately, the cleverness is hidden \"between the lines\" of comic book action. No wonder so many people fail to see this film for what it really is. Amazing cinematography, solid performances (especially from Kurtwood Smith and Miguel Ferrer), memorable musical score.. The list is endless. Granted, the stop motion effects of ED-209 look quite old today, but you have to remember we're talking about a movie made in 1987. RoboCop has its faults, like the rather embarrassing toxic waste scene, but they are easily forgiven compared to all the good things. You must be thinking \"What is this guy on? It's just a dumb little action flick about a cyborg!\" .. Relax, take a deep breath and watch it again. I like obscure art films as much as the next guy, but I'm not going to dismiss such greatness just because it comes wrapped in cartoon violence. I'm not saying RoboCop is art, the best movie ever made or the most important film of the year/decade/millennium. But it definitely deserves to be regarded higher. My only question is: How could Verhoeven succeed so well with this movie, and fail miserably in ALL other Hollywood titles he has worked on?" "Robocop is an unbelieveable experience. I haven't watched the film since 1988 and the other day I recieved it on DVD. So I eagerly popped it in the player and BOOM!!! The only way I can describe Robocop is ultraviolence. The film is so over the top and out of control. The film speaks of a future where big companies will run the governmental defense. Those times are upon us more and more everyday. Paul Verhoeven has made one of the most important science fiction films ever made and it's a brillant piece of cinema." "Paul Verhoeven's career in recent years has been wildly uneven, but back in the 1980s he rocked! His movies 'Spetters', 'The Fourth Man' and 'Flesh & Blood' are all brilliant and worth tracking down. His next movie, his first Hollywood one, could have been a complete disaster. Verhoeven initially passed on it without reading the script and wasn't experienced in working with special effects or a fan of science fiction. Thankfully his wife insisted he make the picture and the end result was a triumph. Apparently this was a very tough shoot for all concerned but the bottom line is what is on screen, and it really works. Few movies if any have managed to juggle SF, action and grim satire in such an entertaining and original fashion. Verhoeven was blessed with an excellent script, a well chosen bunch of actors, and a great behind the scenes team, and added to his own vision 'RoboCop' turned out to be one of the best movies of the 1980s, whatever the genre. Peter Weller ('Buckaroo Banzai') pulls off a difficult job - making the audience care about a guy in a monster suit. Probably the best performance of its kind since Boris Karloff in James Whale's 'Frankenstein' back in the 1930s. Nancy Allen ('Dressed To Kill'), Kurtwood Smith ('12.01 PM'), Ronny Cox ('Deliverance'), Miguel Ferrer ('Twin Peaks'), and the rest of the supporting cast are all first rate, and everything about this movie is perfect. Verhoeven stumbled with his next movie 'Total Recall', and apart from 'Starship Troopers' has pretty much failed to fulfill his potential, but 'RoboCop' remains a classic SF/action movie and a fantastic way to end a great decade of work." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "The success of this movie can be credited to one man; Paul Verhoeven. His special touch of violence, gore and social satire make the movie more than just your average B-movie, with a lame title and simple story and characters. Yes, without Verhoeven this movie seriously would had been nothing more like another B-movie on par with science-fiction/action movies like \"Timecop\" and Albert Pyun movies. The main story of \"RoboCop\" itself is simply and not that complex, however Verhoeven manages to put many different layers for the story as well as the characters in the movie. The social satire in the movie works out brilliantly and is what makes the movie perhaps more entertaining than thrilling or tense. Especially those typical Verhoeven news sketches are brilliant! But also those who will not be able to understand or fully appreciate the social satire elements in the movie, will have plenty to enjoy while watching this. The action itself is top-class and the characters are fun as well as cool. RoboCop himself looks awesome, both in his movements and the way his costume looks. Oh and of course I may not forget his awesome gun! The movie is not only filled with some typical Verhoeven social satire elements but also with some trademark Verhoeven gore and violence. The way Murphy gets killed is very graphic and disturbing. But as always in most Verhoeven movies is the case, the violence is so over-the-top that it's not really shocking to look at but almost more comical like because it's just so over-the-top. Especially what happens to Emil at the end, the gore is way over-the-top there and I absolutely love it! In a movie like this the characters are also always important. Especially the villains and yes, \"RoboCop\" has some highly entertaining and good villains. The group of Clarence, Leon, Joe and Steve are a bunch of entertaining, charismatic stereotypical villains. But also the more educated villains like Dick Jones (Ronny Cox) and Bob Morton (a very young Miguel Ferrer) who also isn't a very nice person. But also the mechanical villain ED-209 is extremely cool and dangerous looking. The stop-motion effects for him are of course heavily outdated this days but it takes away nothing of his threatening appearance. All of the character are entertaining and well developed. Characters also worth mentioning are The Old Man (Dan O'Herlihy) who plays the president of OCP and you can tell by his face gestures that he's not very pleased with the direction Dick Jones is heading towards with the company and Johnson who is always smiling. And of course let's not forget Bixby \"I'd buy that for a dollar!\" Snyder, he's a real classic! They should given that guy a real show on TV. Also the musical score by Basil Poledouris is what helps to make this movie a very memorable one. Poledouris delivers one of his best works. When will he finally get some more attention from the big awards? He has made some great stuff but he rarely has won anything of importance with it. A bit of a disgrace for such a wonderful composer. All in all this is a brilliantly entertaining science-fiction/action movie that simply is perfect in every way, mainly thanks to Verhoeven his input. 10/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "When I first saw \"Robocop\" on Showtime back in 1989, I was about 8 years old. It was definitely the most violent, and one of the most sophisticated films I'd ever seen (at that time...being 8, my dad had issues with showing me \"Blade Runner\" though he seriously wanted me to since it was first released). Everything about the film grabbed me on some level. A lot of people seem to really like this film, though I've heard a share of people and critics say that it's a second-rate film due to the extensive violence and sappy dialogue, calling it cartoon-ish. Well, I have to say that the cartoon-ish quality to the film is part of its allure. It's not only a humorous device for the sake of entertainment, but its significance to the story is great. This is a dystopian future where big companies control almost every part of our existence, from the government to the police to our domestic lives. It's almost Orwell-ian (anybody notice how the OCP building is the tallest in the city?). It's a future where criminals run rampant in every form, from street thugs to business execs. Seriously, the head villain is a greedy business suit who uses a street gang to create trouble so he can provide a solution in the form of a droid with enough firepower to put up a fight with a tank...only to have that blow up in his face and mutilate a fellow exec at its unveiling. Bill Gates never had a bad day like this. Or how about when the gang blows Murphy into a million pieces with enough shotgun ammo to make even the NRA cringe, totally destroying any remnants of his right arm. It's cartoon-ish because it's a comentary on the direction the world could conceivably take, while at the same time being a source of entertainment. Whether the entertainment value was intended for people who love to see guns blazing or for people who like to see horrifying sights (Murphy's execution, for as long as it was and as bloody as it was, HAD to demand a lot of sympathy from people...if it didn't, there's something wrong with you, and let's not forget when Robocop was getting shot up by the swat team). This film has everything going for it. A plot that exists on more levels than its B-movie surface. It's a social commentary, a satire, an action film, a sci-fi film, and at times even a comedy (when Robocop dragged the guy away by his hair, I laughed like mad). The acting is great, the effects are great (not perfect, but that adds to the visual appeal because it's as gritty as the story), the music is great (kudos to Basil Poledouris on an amazing score), and overall...this film is one of the greatest films of its genre. I wouldn't call it \"THE\" greatest, but it's very high up there. I still have yet to see the uncut Director's version, but knowing Paul Verhoeven's work as I do, I know it must be far more brutal than the domestic version (hard to grasp with how far this film goes, but...it evidently went further, showing just how cartoon-ish things can get I suppose). I give it a definite 10/10!!!" "\"RoboCop\" is a surprisingly impressive action film about a young cop (Peter Weller) who is killed by a gang of cruel criminals and is brought back to life with both human and robotic characteristics. Now he is cleaning up the city of Detroit and going after those who brutally murdered him when he was 100% human. This film is ultra-violent in every sense of the word. Anyone under the age of 17 should be strongly cautioned before seeing this film. However, the violence makes the film realistic and more exciting. Paul Verhoeven does some of his best work as a director. The screenplay is very smart for an action film and all the actors give bravura performances. Peter Weller will always be remembered as the original \"RoboCop\". Ronny Cox, Nancy Allen, Miguel Ferrer, and an incredibly evil Kurtwood Smith all do the best work of their careers. An impressive film from the action genre. 4 stars out of 5." "The thing people are starting to realize about Paul Verhoeven is that most of his films are ultimately high concept satires. Both \"Showgirls\" and \"Starship Troopers\" have been recently undergoing reevaluation and getting the critical praise that was completely absent when originally released. \"Robocop\" was Verhoeven's first American success, and while it was never damned in the way his later projects were, many viewers are just starting to pick up on the abundance of satire the material contains, even past the television parodies. The main jab is that Robocop is ostensibly the hero, but his tactics against criminals are often more brutal than the initial crimes themselves. Fortunately, audiences don't need to pay attention to the subtext to enjoy the film. In addition to being an extremely low key comedy, the film also works as an action picture. The action sequences are very well handled by Verhoeven, full of excitement and violence. Its easy to see why this was a huge box office hit when originally released. The pace never once slows down. Another memorable aspect of the picture, even more so than Robocop possibly, are the colorful villains. Ronny Cox is an underrated actor and excels here as the big business villain. Even more astonishing is Kurtwood Smith, an actor best known to my generation for playing Red on \"That 70s Show\", as one of the most hiss-worthy and flat-out sadistic bad guys ever in a film. The rest of the cast is good, but its the villains that steal the show. Overall, \"Robocop\" remains incredibly enjoyable to watch over twenty years later. (8/10)" "Robocop, born of technology is a cyborg, half man/half machine. The future of Law enforcement is here, and he's kicking ass. Alex Murphy was the unfortunate candidate chosen to be robocop after he was brutally massacred by a gang of scumbag criminals. And the robocop program was brought in, after the E.D. 209 (An all robot killing machine) proto-type failed so disastrously. Alex Murphy, now Robocop is effectively dead, but he still has a memory, and sets out on a quest to avenge his own Death, by finding the scumbags responsible. With some quite horrific violence (E.D. 209 and Murphy scenes mainly) and some brilliant action, Robocop is character that you will warm to, as he fights crime on a personal level. Solid entertainment 8/10" "In a futurist Detroit, crime is high and the police are run by a massive private company, keener to reduce running costs than reduce crime. When their new police robot ED209 develops a glitch, they turn to a prototype that blends human tissue with high-tech circuitry. Meanwhile Police officer Murphy and his partner Lewis are out gunned by criminals leaving Murphy mortally wounded. OCP take Murphy's body and use it to make Robocop. However Robocop is so successful that he is targeted by criminal Boddicker. Boddicker turns to his shadowy partners in crime, while Robocop struggles to deal with human memories and a programming system that seems designed to control him and keep him in the dark. Verhoeven's first US film was to set the mould for how the rest of his career would pan out - extreme violence and very little idea of restraint. However this is one of his best films and has much in common with one of his other best (Starship Troopers) - ultra-violence, funny black humour, great action and tonnes of satirical digs at modern life. Here the plot revolves around the creation of Robocop and his fight against crime that goes right to the top. This is complimented by the sub-plot of him trying to rediscover his human side. This is full of great action scenes and eccentric villains. The black comedy is funny, although sometimes you feel bad laughing at so much violence, but the sideswipes are the best. Verhoeven takes digs at TV with his advert filled news broadcasts, at privatisation by showing the crumbling police stations and the huge corporate towers and at heroism by showing Robocop creating just as much mayhem and destruction as the criminals he pursues. His strength however is the action scenes and the sense of tension he creates - I'll don't think anyone can forget the sheer terror of ED209's `glitch'. Weller is good - cast because of his strong jaw and ability to project emotion through a suit of armour - and he does manage to bring out the human side. Allen is good but a but dry. The real support comes from the eccentric, and well known villains and corporate bosses. Ronny Cox, Smith, Ray Wise, Perry, O'Herlihy and Miguel Ferrer are all great in various capacities. Criminal or greedy corporate leader - it's hard to tell which is which at times. A classic bit of sci-fi. Verhoeven has sadly not had a moment as fine as this since and has recently had problems being excessive in Hollywood - the land of excess! This is a landmark film that may not be to everyone's taste." "I've got the music for this movie humming in my head as I type the review. Maybe it's the effect of the movie, or the computer-game based on the movie, I'm not quite sure. Either way it's put me in a more agreeable mood towards this picture. In the future-world of `Robocop', crime is running wild. The OCP, the police of Detroit, try desperately to fight against it but it's a losing battle. When Officer Murphy is brutally gunned down by a bunch of thugs they see an opportunity to test a new technology. Infusing the body with cyber-technology they create the ultimate crime-fighting machine - the synthetic Robocop. Robocop is out to fight crime. but finds that the fight may take him places he never thought of, including inside his past that he thought erased. Acting? It's actually above average for a sci-fi flick. Peter Weller is mostly stoic and chisel-jawed here, as he should be seeing as how he's a robot. However the emotion underneath is shown in the glimpse of the eyes, the almost too-determined posture. It's subtle but it works. Those playing the villains have the real fun. They seem to have delight in playing utter pieces of scum, camping it up in a delightfully menacing fashion that's a joy to see. Speaking of camp. this movie has a great comic-book feel to it. Paul Verhoeven, and the script, have their tongue lodged firmly in their cheek as they make this movie into a satire about the way our vales are changing. The over-the-top violence of the future is reflected in a blackly humorous style by contrasting it against fake-news and ad-snippets. The sheer amount of bullets flying is too much to take in and so you are reduced to incredulity and smiles rather than horror. This is intentional, a saturation of the sensibilities. Without it the movie could feel very bleak. With it there's the feeling of adventure, and an ironic acknowledgement of our own blood-lust in movies. The tone melds with the viewer very well and makes the movie appear more intelligent than it actually probably is, which is something to be said in the IQ of 0 sci-fi culture we're often in. There's enough action throughout this movie that you're never left bored. The villains have about as much dimension as a dot, but Robocop himself has enough character to have merited the concept of a franchise (even if the follow-ups failed to live up the series' potential). It's a very entertaining piece which is told in a manner that's quite amusing. Worthy of a watch, just don't accept to be blown away. 7/10."

"In a crime ridden Detroit of the near future a corporate company OCP has the answer to fighting crime - invent a new type of policeman who won't go on strike . After the death of a policeman called Murphy they stick his body in to a metal shell . Murphy however can still remember a time when he was human I once did an evening film course called Talking Pictures which would involve watching a film then having a two hour group discussion on the film . I saw the filmography before the class started and the vast majority would be art house foreign cinema . The one exception was ROBOCOP and I knew instantly this was the one that was going to split the group right down the middle in to love it or hate it with no in between . True to form this how things worked out . Most the class despised it wondering why the class had to watch such a cartoonish commercial film . I however did state I loved it and considered it to be the third best SF movie of the 1980s behind THE TERMINATOR and ALIENS What makes ROBOCOP such a cerebral enjoyable film is the uncommon mix of social satire and no holds barred Verhoeven excess . While \" greed is good \" to a certain extent the idea of corporate capitalism is something to be rejected . A small self elected clique ruling over the Universe in order to maximise profits is a bad mix of capitalism meets self serving communism . Not so much a mixed economic system but more a combination of greedy speculators from one system being merged with the unthinking party loyalty of the other system . It's greed for money plus greed for power which is a marriage made in hell and being dead isn't enough to make you escape the clutches of OCP and the film revolves around the human element of Murphy remembering who he once was and it's this that is at the core of the movie Of course Verhoeven isn't a director who does sentimental mawkish stuff and I doubt if the audience was wanting to see a Walt Disney film . What they were wanting to see was bad things happen to very bad people and you can't help cheering as criminals get killed , maimed , mutilated and in one case melted . It's a violent film but one that is so cartoonish that the violence is not to be taken seriously , a fact reflected in the loud slightly unrealistic acting style . This attitude wasn't enough to stop its British network premiere on ITV becoming farcical with a TV version being broadcast with notorious lines like \" you gonna be a bad mother crusher \" along with key scenes like the ones with mister melty conspicuous by their absence There is of course a new version of ROBOCOP hitting the cinema this week but is a film I have no interest in watching judging by the clips I've seen of it . It's strange to think that another Verhoeven classic TOTAL RECALL was also recently remade . As it stands the original ROBOCOP remains one of the greatest genre films from the 1980s containing wit , satire and enjoyably mean carnage" "Detroit is under siege by a corrupt CEO in the police department...also by rapists, robbers, and the group of thugs who murdered Officer Murphy. Murphy (flawlessly played by Peter Weller) was a family man with a big heart whose body is eventually 'saved' by tech-geniuses, transforming him into a robot-cop (with a big heart, natch). The violence in the film is incredibly brutal in the manner of \"Death Wish\", yet it can almost be overlooked--even deemed necessary--in the context of the plot. Weller exudes sensitivity (not easy to do under that coat of armor), and he's matched very well by Ronny Cox (delightfully sinister and sniveling) and spunky Nancy Allen (in her best performance). A bleak vision of the future, though one which offers hope underneath its chestplate of destruction. Followed by \"RoboCop 2\" in 1990, \"RoboCop 3\" in 1993, and a television series in 1994. ***1/2 from ****" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This was a film that I enjoyed watching when I was a kid and it was my favorite film. Now, years later I just watched it and I was hesitant because I thought it would be cheesy, but it was amazing. It is ultra violent even by today's standards. It is a great mix of action and sci-fi and it has a message. You would not have to look hard into this film to see some deeper meaning in it, though it appears to just be a action film it is also a testament to human life. One of the most prominent messages in this film is that you can put a human in a robotic shell but he is still a human. It also has messages about corporations running our lives. There is a scene where the main character has been killed and the company that owns the police is about to turn him into Robocop and someone says is this OK and the corporate rep says \"we own him, we can do whatever we like with him.\" It is a classic film and one that has to be watched by everybody. It disappoints me that in every top 100 movies list or somethings like that you will never see this film, I think it is a classic and is one of the most underrated films of all time." "Back when I was the proud owner of a top of the range ZX Spectrum +2a, Robocop was probably the best platform game that I ever played. It had every thing you could want from a game: A good plot, great graphics and really cool guns! I hadn't seen the film at this point, I'm not sure why, I was way too young, yes, but that has never stopped anyone, least of all me. When I did get around to seeing the film (I still would have been underage) I loved it! It had everything: A good plot, good effects and it had really cool guns!! A few years ago, given a gentle prod by an interview with the director, I sat down and watched Robocop from a different standpoint and bugger me it was even better, it had everything: Social comment, religious overtones, biting satire and really cool guns! When Murphy is killed at the beginning of the film it's because he's a policeman, a man who gives his life to help others, a man who has no crimes and no sins. He has a wife and child and lives an idyllic life despite working to help the beaten and bedraggled, the down trodden and helpless. He's persecuted, crucified and when the scientists get hold of him they seal him in a metal tomb from which they believe he can never escape. I'm being unsubtle here but there really is no need to beat around the bush with these things. Murphy is being depicted as a Messiah for 21st Century America, a messiah as the America dictates, a messiah, that is, with really cool guns! Robocop is, despite this, a VERY funny film. But is it a piece of Hollywood trash masquerading as intelligent cinema? Or is a clever comment on America masquerading as trash? Well, let's face it, it's both! The social commentary on how big business is big crime and money is the route of all evil is as clumsy as it is obvious. However, the accusatory tone it adopts when dealing with its hero is superbly realised and works brilliantly because of it. Robocop is a character ripped from a 50's comic strip; he is violent but just, mechanical but warm and yet still, somehow, attractive to women. The director pokes fun at the ease with which he attracts the audience to his central character and develops the messiah characteristics almost as a joke on his own creation. He knows Robocop is too good to be true and has fun raising his status to king of men, even having him walk on water as he extracts his revenge on the men who 'killed' him. The real twist for me is that in order to dispense with the man who masterminded the criminal activities he has been investigating, Robocop has to break the rules. Having already begun to regain his memories and escape his tomb he proceeds to OCP to meet his Nemesis. Robocop wants to kill him, he needs to kill him, and the only way he can escape his tomb is to destroy the man who put him in it. Yet his directives, his internal rules-set down by someone else- that guide his life forbid him to do it! Thall Shalt Not Kill. You've all seen the film, you all know what happens. So what is Verhoevan saying about his messiah for the 21st century?" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "\"Robocop\" was what gave the world the robotic police officer that would rival the Terminator as the greatest cyborg film character of all time. Although, I'm not gonna take a side in that debate, but I am gonna give Robocop the recognition it deserves. He was something that was totally new at the time (1987), and since then the movie got 2 (crappy) sequels, a comic book and a mini-series. Robocop is set in the future and portrays a very dark version of Detroit, and its crime level has gone up considerably. In it, a cop named Alex Murphy gets literally blown away by a gang of nasty criminals on his first day on the job. But later a company (OCP) uses his remains to build a mechanical cop in order to cut down on the crime in order to build \"Delta City\" to replace the corrupted dystopia that was once Detroit. Later on, Robocop makes a name for himself around the city, but unexpectedly he starts remembering what he was before his death, and through this we start to learn more about Murphy since we didn't zilch about him before he died. And this is how he starts to regain his lost humanity. And the first rule about making a movie with a robot for a character is that you MUST make it human in some way, that's the reason why Robocop worked so well and why \"Terminator 2\" worked so well. Towards the ending, after he takes off his helmet for the final battle, reveals his face. And a little later, after the Old Man asks him for his name, he replies \"Murphy\", this is one of the most heart-touching moments in science fiction which generally don't have moments like those. The symbolism in here is perfect. Another thing that really got me were the bad guys. And the best of the gang is without a doubt, Kurtwood Smith as Clarence Boddicker. Honestly, I have never seen a guy who looks like a 50 year old pencil pusher to be so threatening. He delivers his lines with such ferocity and perfection that he becomes perhaps one of the greatest villains in the history of cinema. And his classic lines, \"Can you fly, Bobby?\" and \"B*****s, leave!\" will never be forgotten. Also, his crew is worth noting, Emil will be known for the gas station scene (probably the best part of the movie), Joe will be remembered for his laugh and his \"Does it hurt? Does it hurt?\" line. And Leon will be recognized for his hilarious expression he makes when the disfigured Emil confronts him and when Robocop pulls his hair in the dance club. And lastly Clarence will be known for pretty much everything he does and says in here. And all these guys are MEAN, plain and simple. They basically kill and hurt others for their own amusement and express no pity or remorse at all. These guys are as real as movie villains could possibly get. The action is excellent, the gas station scene was bad@$$, the drug factory shootout was fantastic and the ending when Robocop takes out all the bad guys in the same place where they killed him at the steel mill is unforgettable, thanks to the Cobra Assault Cannons (forgot what they're called), but it's one of the sweetest weapons ever made up in a film. The one liners couldn't have been better. \"Dead or alive, you're coming with me\" is a quote that should've been on the Top 100, but for some reason, it's not. \"Your move, creep\" is another worth mentioning. And the before mentioned stuff that the bad guys say are pretty cool to say in real life situations as well. Robocop is a classic in the golden age of science fiction when we didn't have too many of that over-the-top, unoriginal crap that we're getting now. I'm gonna cherish this movie forever, and I hope you will too." "\"RoboCop\" is the sort of movie that seems like it would be more than idiotic if you only hear about it once. But it turns out to actually be quite good. Less of an action movie than a look at urban decay, the movie makes the most of its potential at every turn. Officers Alex J. Murphy (Peter Weller) and Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen) patrol the streets of crime-ridden Detroit. One day, while tracking down a gang, Murphy gets cornered and shot to death. But that's not the end of him; a group of scientists turns him into the steel-clad title character. Before too long, RoboCop is out fighting crime like never before. In the process, he not only decides to find the gang that killed him, but also investigates a conspiracy going to the city's highest levels of government. Watching the movie, you get the feeling that everyone must have had a lot of fun making it. It's really neat now that I know that Kurtwood Smith - aka Red Foreman on \"That '70s Show\" - played one of the gang members. Paul Verhoeven, who turned out the masterpiece \"Soldier of Orange\" in his native Netherlands, created something more than cool here. You'll love it." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "\"Robocop\" is one of those movies that inspires debate, as well it should. The director, Paul Verhoeven (who later became an even bigger player with films like \"Total Recall\" and \"Basic Instinct\") has definitely indulged in extreme violence and has no qualms about presenting violence as an object of fun. But I would defend it even if its only virtue was its action sequences because those elements are handled so well. There's a number of imaginatively staged action scenes, and it never devolves into an arcade-style shooting gallery like so many 80s actions films do. The action is compelling because of Verhoeven's style and because he's given the characters enough substance that we care about what happens to them, including at least a half dozen interesting villains. A lot of discussion has revolved around whether or not this film deserves to be called satire. Those looking for Moliere-like pearls in Verhoeven's modestly amusing commercial interruptions are understandably disappointed. This isn't the kind of movie that you can look at or objectify in order to access its ideas on an intellectual level. It's a different kind of beast: it must be entered into, it must fulfill its function as an action narrative first and foremost and it carries its ideas like a wedding train dragged by a semi-truck a prominent after-thought. At any rate I feel it's closer to camp than satire, one of the first camp action films of the 80s style I would argue (\"Remo Williams\" being another, now largely forgotten). It's a good drinking movie, and this most recent time when I watched it my friend and I were laughing and yelling so much that we probably missed half the dialog. But I don't think we missed much of the point. If it was a satire, Robocop wouldn't emerge as such a serious figure invested with pathos and personality. The movie itself is best enjoyed in my opinion as a joyride with some interesting commentary about America's relationship to violence thrown in by way of farce; you wait for each villain to meet his fitting end and watch the carnage pile up. The villains are all so easy to hate, and all the actors playing them are having a lot of fun. Ronny Cox is fantastic as the corporate heel, but I've always enjoyed Kurtwood Smith the most. Really this is a very well-cast movie all around. I love the scene where Miguel Ferrer has his coke party interrupted by Smith with his bomb and his video. It's easy to underestimate the kind of skill Smith shows when he's so funny and obviously has his tongue in cheek but still manages to be convincingly sadistic and evil. Honestly, a comparison to Vincent Price in his heyday is not unwarranted. Weller for his part is adequate and it's a difficult role so that's no insult. I didn't care for Nancy Allen in the movie but I can't really put my finger on the reasons. I guess she just came across as very tentative. I think it was a small mistake for Verhoeven to have her play it in a more grounded mode; his butt-kicking females are more fascinating but he does always have problems directing female heroes (see \"Showgirls\" and \"Total Recall\" for example). I think this is a pretty intelligent movie with some layers to it. It's better as science fiction than you would at first suspect, mining Frankenstein territory in a number of scenes  particularly where the callous nature of the creator is shown (\"lose the arm\") and when the police force turns on Robocop like the mob of angry villagers in Whale's film version. In Shelley's time perhaps a single scientist was a suitable object of terror, but by choosing corporate monster-makers the writers of this film gave the story a far more prescient object for paranoia. Indeed, even since I last saw the film in the late 90s, the film's central premise has become even more relevant due to America's misadventures with corporate security forces in Iraq. This time around I noticed all the elements of Western parody in the film. Not just the twirling pistol (which also, interestingly, performs a plot function by identifying Robocop as Murphy) but also in various other scenes. For example one poster here complained about the \"generic\" or obligatory nature of the convenience store scene and the rape scene where Robocop is introduced as a hero. I couldn't disagree more. They parallel the arrival of the hero in a traditional Western; the convenience store works for the trading post in \"Shane\", the nightclub scene doubles for a tavern brawl (i.e. the beginning of \"Rio Bravo\") and the attempted rape parallels any number of damsel in distress scenarios. That's a very funny scene for me because of the way the girl goes up to Robocop after he rescues her and kind of drapes herself over him (\"My hero!\"), a very prototypical American bit that you'd see in a Randolph Scott Western from the 40s. Robocop's sterile reaction is perfect, again a parody of the emotionless law enforcing gunfighter of the Old West of American mythology. I expect to find more and more interesting elements the more I watch the film over the years. I think recently its reputation has taken a slight hit  look at the interesting life this film has had. Originally it was a big hit both in theaters and on video. Over the years it was not forgotten because action movie fans would return to it and be surprised at how well it holds up and how many ideas are floating about beneath the surface. Then based on their recommendations movie-goers of a more intellectual bent gave the movie a chance and were disappointed. It's time for the pendulum to swing back and for the movie to be reclaimed as what it is  an intelligent violent film." "RoboCop is a very good but violent film that in My opinion is not for kids. I say not for kids because unlike most films the violence it shows is very graphic. Though the film is somewhat sad but the film is never boring and has good acting. Peter Weller did an outstanding job being RoboCop! Ronny Cox puts on a great performance but to me his role is similar to his role in Total Recall and Kurtwood Smith was good aswell. Miguel Ferrer was good and Nancy Allen looked good. Great music by Basil Poledouris and good direction by veteran director Paul Verhoeven. This is the first of a three film series. This is a great film for action and sci-fi fans alike!" "Robocop is Truly a great violent movie. Packed with plenty of blood and Violence, this is one entertaining movie. Set in Detroit, one of the most violent city's, Robocop is the story of a police killed by a ruthless gang. He is later used in a experiment, and becomes the half man half machine, Robocop. Peter Sellers gives us the best movie of his entire career. Paul Verhoevan has made some great film like Basic Instict, Hollow Man, Starship troopers and Total Recall. I think Robocop, is still is best work out of the lot. It is the best out of the Robocop trilogy by a margin. The Second part was entertaining in some scenes and is worth watching. The third was a absolute disaster, with nothing great about it, apart from robot Ninjas. Watch Robocop 1, it is a fabulous movie." "Director Paul Verhoven, the director of TOTAL RECALL unleashes a very original film, that despite what my first thought upon seeing commercials was, is not a copy off of the Terminator. The actors are not very famous, but sometimes the best films have no name actors-and sometimes you get the best performances out of them because they're not full of themselves. The blend of sci-fi, action, and thriller was very good, and the stunts and action scenes themselves were memorable. Overall ROBOCOP is a very under-rated film (in the way of critics and popularity) but for anyone who's seen it, they know when it's over that THEY have found an entertaining blockbuster. That's how films like 'Speed' and such were accepted so well. Audiences not only can recognize with the characters symbolically, but they can also sit on the edge of their seats. Such a film is Robocop. A very entertaining at the most, well done film. I give it a good rating-it's just pure entertainment! 3.5/5 STARS--" "Add another review" "Find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your Watchlist and rate your favorite movies and TV shows on your phone or tablet!")("Movies, TV & Showtimes" "Celebs, Events & Photos" "News & Community" "Watchlist" "" "Find industry contacts & talent representation" "Manage your photos, credits, & more" "Showcase yourself on IMDb & Amazon" "Sign in with Facebook Other Sign in options" "Own the rights?" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "SOME SPOILERS \"You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.\" - The Miranda Warning For me, one of the best parts of \"RoboCop\" comes at the very end. An old man asks the robot, \"What's your name, son?\" The robot cop turns his head, sports a wan smile, and says, \"Murphy.\" Then as he turns to start to walk away the camera cuts to black and the theme song roars in as we read the bold print on-screen that says, \"ROBOCOP.\" \"RoboCop\" could be called a rip-off of \"The Terminator\" in many senses. The trailer even used the exact same theme song as that of \"Terminator.\" But \"RoboCop\" is a different story in many ways, and, in some ways, the action is even better than that in \"The Terminator\" (though I must include that the latter film is a better one overall). The film's hero, RoboCop, has a gentle affection to him absent in the evil \"Terminator,\" mainly because he is still human in some ways. It starts with a man named Murphy (Peter Wellers). Amid talks of a police strike, he and his new partner (Nancy Allen) chase down a pack of criminals to an abandoned warehouse. After being caught, graphically tortured and then shot in the head by the gang, Murphy is shipped off to a hospital whereupon he is announced dead on arrival. However, Murphy is revived by fusing his body together with that of a machine robot named \"RoboCop,\" the \"future of law enforcement.\" RoboCop is a cop who will never hold a strike against the police force, never take a bribe, never become corrupt in any way. There is only one problem with RoboCop--he has flashbacks of his past life and family. He also remembers who killed him. And so RoboCop sets off to find his killers. \"RoboCop\" is an action man's action movie. Things blow up, people get killed, and there are some impressive stunts. But all the while the movie keeps true to its core. The simple premise behind the film is nothing more than a B-movie so typically found in the era of the eighties (a decade of some very memorable, very forgettable, and/or cheesy films). But it's nevertheless brought out of mediocrity by its lead performance from Peter Wellers, whose acting skills seemed pretty bad out of the suit rather than inside it, where he seems at home. Wellers (a.k.a. Buckaroo Bonzai) also extends a technique Arnold Schwarzenegger used in \"The Terminator.\" As a cyborg, Schwarzenegger would turn his head, then let the body follow. Wellers' character is even more rigid and robotic in movements than the T-800, and so he turns his head, for example, far to the right, and after a second his body spins on its heels and follows the head. Something like that takes a lot of concentration--just try walking around like that. Now add acting and remembering your lines. Wellers does a pretty good job. The director, Paul Verhoeven, knows how to construct a well-oiled action vehicle. He skips the bull and gets right to the harcore blood and guts stuff. But he does manage to bring a certain sense of connection with the character--and a sense of morals. Given another director, \"RoboCop\" would have been an average 80s film at best. Its plot vaguely resembles \"The Terminator,\" and the script isn't always A material. But Paul Verhoeven knows when and where to insert touching scenes (like when RoboCop goes through his old home and sees flashbacks), and he firmly grips the point of the story (messing with nature can be dangerous, not only physically but emotionally for the person you screwed around with). Another director helming a movie like this would never have thought to include such things. Unfortunately, Verhoeven does not know how to construct a film about a strip club (see \"Showgirls\"), but that's another story. \"RoboCop\" had amazing potential for sequels. Murphy's quest to find his family, to unlock his past, and to continue fighting crime are all the sort of stuff you hear about in comic books and comic book films. Unfortunately, the two sequels that followed \"RoboCop\" were major drags--the sort of films that \"RoboCop\" avoided becoming ever so carefully. Overblown, cheesy, stupid action flicks with no plot nor affection. As it stands, the third film has exactly 3.3 out of 10 stars on the IMDb, giving it a place on the Website's list of worst films of all time. I wouldn't go so far as to say the sequels were necessarily some of the worst films of all time, but after watching \"RoboCop\" you have an odd starvation to dig deeper into the film franchise and deeper into the story. The sequels kind of negate that starvation. \"RoboCop\" is a superhero movie, make no mistake about it. But it's an extraordinary one--an action film that starts and never lets up on its goals. And all the while it presents a truly lovable main character who is nothing more than a robot. In a time when every single action film out there presents us with overblown budgets, crappy acting, writing, directing, horrible buddies, and nothing but special effects we've seen mimicked since the release of \"The Matrix,\" \"RoboCop\" is a gentle reminder that, at one time, action movies were what they were--action movies--and the directors, writers and actors behind them had a wide range of talent. \"RoboCop\" is a B-movie, but movies of this B-quality are simply not made anymore. 5/5 stars. - John Ulmer" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "\"The sooner we admit our capacity for evil, the less apt we are at destroying one another.\" - Paul Verhoeven. Most of Verhoeven's films deal with different forms of fascism or excess. As a child, Verhoeven himself witnessed firsthand the brutalities of the Second World War. Indeed, the German Army occupied Verhoeven's own hometown, and quickly implemented a policy of \"enforced conformity\" (Gleichschaltung), shutting down all non Nazi organisations and forcing strict curfews and laws upon the Dutch population. Verhoeven himself was lined up against a wall and heckled by a German execution squad. They fired their rifles up into the air, and teased him for wetting his pants. It thus seems only normal that, later in his life, Verhoeven would become contemptuous of man. His films are routinely violent, bloody, and satirical, and some even broadcast disguised contempt for we the audience. Verhoeven's \"heroes\" are themselves often base, nasty creatures, whether they live in war-torn Europe or the contemporary psychedelia of Western techno-capitalism. Indeed, films like \"Robocop\", \"Total Recall\", \"Basic Instinct\", \"Starship Troopers\" and \"Showgirls\" all revel in a kind of tawdry decadence. Ugly, crass and loud, they're mock-celebrations of junk, money, lights and noise. Verhoeven seems to believe that Americans are capable of responding only to idiocy and base stimuli. Verhoeven's two science fiction films, \"Robocop\" and \"Starship Troopers\", are his most openly critical. Simultaneously pandering to and sneering at lug-heads, these films manages a strange juggling act; both consist of a number of ironic jokes aimed at sophisticated audience members, yet are also devoted to B movie gore and violence. The simple notion of \"revenge\" also drives both films, Verhoeven's audience whipped up in a frenzy of both blood lust and revenge. Perhaps what Verhoeven does best in these films is highlight how complacency and stupidity are prerequisites to different forms of control and abuse. \"Robocop\" makes this implicit with its truncated 3 minute news bulletins (for its ADD society), its consumer catchphrases, its themes of dehumanisation - through technology (robocop), capitalism (OCP) and the media (\"I'll buy that for a dollar!\") - all of which point to a world in which man is too busy bowing to biochemical impulses than look around. The film is so cynical, that it even suggests that the bad guys are funded by the same omniscient company that funds the military and police force. In this future world, capitalism has evolved to the point where it shoots itself in the foot just to sell itself band-aids. Verhoeven's other films do similar things. \"Basic Instinct\" and \"Showgirls\" are not full blown satires, but they are deliberately garish, mocking the very sex and sleaze they trade in. Verhoeven's Hollywood filmography itself seems like a calculated assault on sex (Basic Instinct, Hollowman, Showgirls), money and violence (Robocop, Starship Troopers), America's chief excesses. Significantly, Verhoeven's also had long-time plans to film a religious movie. 7.9/10  Some kind of classic." "For the sake of posterity, I must register my opinion of \"Robocop\", but there's not much to say that hasn't already been said. The film is a science fiction masterpiece, but it's not a heavy-handed one like \"2001\" or a ponderous one like \"Blade Runner\". It is packed not only with action and the most explicit of screen violence, but with incisive ideas and frightening concepts about the future, many of which have already come to pass. Director Paul Verhoeven, who has made great films like \"Turkish Delight\" \"Spetters\", \"The 4th Man\" and the awesome \"Starship Troopers\", directs with amazing skill and energy, and injects a vein of black humor that elevates this to levels way beyond previous genre watersheds. No masterpiece lacks a brilliant screenplay, and the screenplay here is just that. Few science fiction films in history have so masterfully combined great ideas with violent action, sharp characterization and jaw-dropping special effects. The film's most brutal set piece -- the gunning down of Murphy (Peter Weller) -- is one of cinema's most harrowing and tragic achievements, a hard, cruel punch to the gut and emotions that sweeps us into the film's amazing second act. The performances are flawless, the villains are incredibly mean-spirited, and the special visual and make-up effects are superb. If you want to know how to make great science fiction, \"Robocop\" is a great place to start." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Ahhh...Robocop. How I've missed you. The tale of one man's death and rebirth into a formidable robotic killing machine really tugs at my heartstrings. From the brilliant action scenes (Clarence running down Emil and turning him into a splash of toxic sludge is genius), to the acting (Miguel Ferrier is especially good here as Bob Morton, Robocop's creator. Too bad he bought the farm halfway through the film. Maybe he can come back in Robocop 4 as an apparition?), the actors themselves (Peter Weller does an admirable job as Robo, and Nancy Allen is still hot, no matter what anyone says), and even the in-jokes about corporate control and capitalism, you can't help but love this film. Everyone should see it immediately. Bottom Line: Watch this and not the two sub-par sequels that followed...but you could try watching the TV series. Or the cartoon series. If you want." "I've a very personal connection to RoboCop. It's been my favourite movie since I first saw it 25 years ago and was also the first truly adult film I'd seen at that time in my life. It's extreme violence shocked me and left and indelible mark, it's vile, memorable villains, breakneck pace and frenetic action were like nothing I'd ever seen. I have revisited the film at various ages over the years and have regularly reappraised it, each time trying to gauge it objectively without the haze of nostalgia. Whilst other movies I loved in my youth now rate far less favourably with me when viewed as an adult, RoboCop is as good now as it was all those years ago. As an adult I now clearly see the deeper thematic elements such as the commentary on 80's corporate greed and Verhoven's Christ allegory of Murphy's crucifixion and resurrection. The most powerful aspects of the movie are some of the more emotional elements such as Murphy's \"I can feel them, but I can't remember them\" scene and Murphy going to the abandoned family home, all played with perfectly balanced pathos by Peter Weller who puts in a career best performance in a very difficult, unconventional acting role. The script and editing are second to none. It careens from one classic scene to another yet is perfectly paced. There is no scene that feels surplus to requirements, no fat on the meat. It's tone is also very unique, due in no greater part to its director's style. Verhoven employs a hyper-realism, gun shot wounds look as horrific as they would in real life, the use of a non-scripted crash team to work on saving Murphy after he's shot, all these things give a pleasing sheen of authenticity to the film. Special mention must go to the film's technical aspects, namely the great production design and the RoboCop suit designed by Rob Bottin who also did the film's superb practical effects. The designs of RoboCop's suit and Craig Davies' imposing ED-209 have aged extremely well and have a timeless quality. And let's not forget Basil Poledouris' majestic score. It perfectly complements the film and is both equal parts rousing and mournfully melodic. One of the things RoboCop is most famous for is the aforementioned violence and indeed it is uber violent but the violence is an intrinsic factor that adds to the film's unique quality. Never before had such brutal, graphic, sadistic violence been portrayed in a major Hollywood movie. Again this is Verhoven's doing. Coming from Holland where there was no equivalent of the MPAA he was able to do as he wished as a film maker in his native country. He grew up during the Nazi occupation of Holland and violence was something he saw frequently and this shows in much of his work and none more so than here where it is used to great effect to instill sympathy in Murphy's character who doesn't get a great amount of screen time before being so brutally killed and it also paints this future Detroit as a cold merciless place. It never feels excessive when seen in context of the movie but is certainly not for the faint hearted. Whilst on the subject, special mention must go to Kurtwood Smith's exceptionally vile and sadistic Clarence Boddiker, easily a contender for Best Movie Villain Ever. RoboCop is very much a product of the 80's, particularly Reagan's 80's America and this is in no way to its detriment. Indeed as the recent neutered, generic, typically modern Hollywood remake shows, they'd never be able to make a film this visceral these days. It even manages to be strangely prophetic - the real city of Detroit recently filing bankruptcy and Downtown Dallas, Houston, where the bulk of it was filmed now more than ever looking like the Old Detroit seen in the film. The film has in it's arsenal, amongst other things, an incredible, almost mythical third act which is more Western than Sci-Fi. From the point where Lewis goes back to the Steel Mill to bring Murphy supplies the film starts to peak and doesn't let up until the incredibly satisfying final scene which scored off the chart with test audiences causing the originally planned final Media Break ending to be dropped leaving the \"Nice shooting son, what's your name?\" ending we have now. For me this film has it all, a great script with endlessly quotable dialogue, great performances across the board, great effects that service the film instead of acting as a distraction, a superb score, perfect editing, a classic revenge theme, The Greatest Film Location Ever (The Old Steel Mill), the list goes on. I'll finish with this, don't look beyond the original RoboCop as it's greatness is only sullied by the poor sequels and dire TV series that followed. Instead see it as it should have remained, an undiluted classic, a masterpiece of modern film making with wit, brutality but also a very clearly defined soul. Nice shooting indeed!" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "There is a cornucopia of action scenes in this movie, so the Arnold Schwarzenegger demographic won't be disappointed. Guns of every type are deployed and powerful semi-automatic pistols are the least of them. There are heavily armed robots weighing a ton that walk with reverberating thumps. There's a van with a murderer at the wheel that embeds itself into a huge tank labeled \"Toxic Waste\" and we see the driver melt before our eyes. And then there's Peter Weller as the half-human cyborg cop, ripped apart by bullets, reassembled with electronic components by villainous Ronnie Cox who heads the OCP corporation. When this first showed up on television I caught a few minutes of Weller's titanium-coated figure blasting some people to pieces and thought, \"Oh, (expletive deleted), another comic strip hero brought to life.\" But, having just watched it through, I think it's rather more than just another mindless superhero story. Neither the director, Paul Verhoeven, nor his two writers ever went anywhere after this, but they hit the ball with \"Robocop\" as typical action movie, black comedy, and social commentary. The opening is hilarious. It's a satire on the evening news. Two handsome, cheerful faces -- one bland guy and one Leeza Gibbons who looks like she could eat a man alive -- run through the news of the world in the near future -- riots here and there, police strikes, a war at the Mexican border, and so on. Cut to a commercial for some heart transplant business. Some huckster with silvery hair, a television actor's voice, and a white coat and stethoscope takes us through the corporation's offices, telling us we get to choose our own heart at a discount price, even \"the Jarvik model,\" and he grins and holds up a model of the artificial heart, which looks like two pink plastic concertinas glued together. \"And remember -- we care.\" Another commercial advertises the new Model 6000 \"Sux\" car, which boasts 8.2 miles to the gallon. Later, the news anchors tell us about a tragic incident in which dozens of satellites forming a missile shield (\"the Peace Platform\") have gone awry and struck the earth with lasers, killing more than one hundred people -- a human tragedy. And who built the lasers? OCP. \"Hell, we practically are the military,\" remarks Cox. Everything is being privatized. \"The military/industrial complex\" has become \"the militaryindustrial complex.\" The corporation runs everything. Hospitals, construction, social control, security, \"urban pacification\", energy, the whole magilla. And OCP makes worse mistakes than the government, if that's possible. At a board meeting, Cox introduces a two-ton super robot that will replace human cops. To demonstrate, he has a board member hold a gun. The robot orders him to put down the gun, giving him fifteen seconds to comply. The frightened suit complies but somehow the robot continues its countdown. The two dozen other board members dive out of the way as the robot blasts the innocent victim to bloody shreds. \"A big glitch,\" somebody mutters. Nobody mentions the dead man. It's just that the failure makes the company look bad. The basic plot has Peter Weller, who is only half a man, slowly recovering his memory and his identity. As he goes about obeying orders and trying to enforce the law, he's smitten by all sorts of objects and weapons. He's not entirely invulnerable either. Like Achilles, he has a vulnerable spot -- his lips and cheeks -- that never seem to suffer any damage. And he's human enough to bleed when his armor is punctured. By the end, he's removed his helmet so that we can see Weller's hairless face and part of his head. He's recovered his memory completely too. He answers to the name of Murphy and even smiles. A dreadful thought occurs to me at this point. With it's sour view of privatization and corporate culture, in some sectors of social space this is going to be interpreted as socialist propaganda. That's not actually the case, though. OCP is run by the avuncular and well-meaning old Dan O'Herlihy. The flies in the corporate ointment are Ronnie Cox, Miguel Ferrer, and the smarmy henchmen they hire to do their wet work and their cocaine running. The henchmen are led by Kurtwood Smith, who has never done anything on screen but lead henchmen. When you see Kurtwood Smith headed your way, you know there's trouble. You just don't know whether it will be prolonged and debilitating like prostate cancer or quick and painless like a severe stroke. The modern screen is full of splinter-group villains. They've included Russians, the IRA, and the CIA. Not the originals but some violent cabal within the group. Let's not offend anyone who might buy a ticket. Still -- inside this prototypical, titanium-coated, two-ton action movie behemoth there is a humanitarian trying to get out. And I get down on my knees and grovel in gratitude that the writers and director had the decency never to let Weller's half-human face show any tears, not even during the moments that were nearest the sentimental." "Spoilers Ahead: Want to appreciate this treasure? Watch the lobotomized, badly acted, boring piece of crap sequel. Look, if you are so inventive, could you stop stealing our movies and turning them into crap? Put down the comic book, write something original like this generation did. An action movie rises or falls predicated upon its villains; this has two excellent ones Dick Jones and Clarence. They can act, by the way, as can Weller. He doesn't look and sound like he had a massive stroke with a glassy eyed, dumb ass stare. Verhoeven fills the movie with biting, trenchant satire the breadth of the entire 80s Yuppies culture. Weller makes you care about him with his acting ability coupled with the real suffering Clarence and the boys mete out to him. The alliance between Jones and Clarence is well developed and understandable not introduced and then disappearing; I don't know maybe they ran out of crayons for the new script? When you compare both of the Vorhoeven's treasures that were bastardized by the lobotomies, this and Total Recall, what you notice, right away, is the drop in intellectual content. This movie is not just a great action picture; note, it contains action, not four scenes, two of which are training exercises. The acting, writing and directing are so superior. Satire requires much more intelligence than a straightforward narrative. This movie moves very well, has biting satire with great humor. Ferrer's Bob Morton is worth owning the movie for, what a depiction of a cut throat take no prisoners executive. I will be honest with you, it was after watching the abomination that is the remake, that I really appreciated this movie more. As soon as I was done, I put this one in to cleanse my mind. Yes, all of Vorhoeven's movies are quite violent, this is certainly no exception. It also is quite intense, fast moving and you will not be bored for one minute. Even with the dated effects, the dialog is funny and sarcastic. Weller's acting ability dwarfs lobotomy boy. The new guy has this expressionless insouciance devoid of one scintilla of inflection in his voice. For everyone who has not seen the remake, watch it then watch this over, believe me, you will have a new found respect for Vorhoeven's film. Cox out-acts Keaton badly in comparison, it is not even close. The real difference is the intelligence of the writing: everything is in the proper place and depth. We get his assembly but it doesn't consume half the movie. Also, his trip back to his family is but a detour here, in the remake it eats twenty minutes out of the film. You have no idea how utterly brain dead the remake is until you revisit this movie. All the cutting jabs at our culture, the intense corporate infighting and throat cutting which gave the original its bite has been castrated out of the remake. This movie is also free of the Deus Ex Machina ontology for retards that we have to endure in the remake. Look, it is RoboCop not Being and Nothingness? They think if they throw ontological babble at you it makes up for a boring, badly acted piece of crap. The cast and the writing are the stars of this film. Weller, Cox, Ferrer and Kurtwood Smith tower over the cheese ball group of a no talented ensemble with the exception of Oldman. Keaton is so lost in the remake; hey, he tried menacing in Pacific Heights, it is out of his range, Hello? Do yourself a big favor, make yourself watch the Curious George version of RoboCop before you re-watch this classic. A Very Good Cutting Satire. \"A Wise Man Strives For Clarity; A Fool For Obscurity.\" Schopenhauer" "In future Detroit, the crime rate has gone through the roof, the police are on strike and a private corporation has taken over the police force. After the death of one of their rookie officers (Peter Weller), they try some experimental surgery and create RoboCop. This film is vastly underrated, perhaps due in part to the stinky sequels. The plot is brilliant, the political undertones are there... we have action, we have science fiction, perhaps even a touch of horror. There are the intentional metaphors and symbolism that hark back to Frankenstein and even Jesus Christ. I will not even begin to talk about privatization... The cast and crew are quite impressive. Rob Bottin, quite possibly the best special effects wizard in history, was there to see things through and gave us such excellent moments as \"the incredible melting man\". The incredible Nancy Allen, in one of her landmark performances (and maybe her best outside a Brian DePalma film). And Wisconsin's own Peter Weller. Hard to believe Orion studio head Mike Medavoy pushed for Arnold Schwarzenegger. Big mistake, and we are fortunate Weller won the role. What is really amusing is how they used the backdrop of Detroit, rather than one of the more traditional film settings. Because, as we all know, Detroit today (2010-2015) is a crime-ridden cesspool. I find it hard to believe that this film shows life all that much worse than it really is in Detroit today. The film has been released in various formats, including from the Criterion Collection. The MGM 20th Anniversary edition DVD is particularly strong. The list of features is almost endless, and the double disc offers two versions of the film. And, of course, the excellent audio commentary. All that really remains is the possibility of upgraded picture and sound. (A blu-ray release may have that already.)" "This is one of the best science fiction films ever made. Unfortunately, neither the sequels nor a T.V series could top this entertaining mix of action,humor and emotion. Robocop 2 relied a little too much on action and not enough emotion. Robocop 3 could have been good if they had written a better storyline and script. The story in 3 just did not work out with audiences, and that's why it got such negative reviews. If there ever is a Robocop 4 i hope that they bring back Paul Verhoven, The director of the first. Maybe he can help bring Robocop back to life. The producers could not wait to make sequels and that is why they weren't like the original" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This movie is about as close to perfection as one gets. It has a great story, great acting (good emotion on the part of Weller as Robo), the amount of violence is perfect (not over-the-top like Robocop 2, not too watered down like Robocop 3). The villains (both the street thugs and the wealthy businessmen) are so dangerous than they're downright scary in their ruthlessness, and the heroes are brave (though a bit too red, white and blue). It's the kind of film that inspires one to be righteous, and stronger, and in some situations, it may even persuade you to become a cop :) There are deeper meanings to it also. The shame of big business is obvious as it explicitly described how OCP gives cops inferior products, like faulty body armor that are said to not work, in the hopes that the police will go on strike and, as a result, OCP will have a very lucrative contract to provide the city with \"security\" (ie, protection for the rich). There's commentaries about the cheapness of human life, as well as one about corruption (a criminal who's the suspect in over 30 cop deaths being allowed out of jail in 24 hours?!) *****SPOILERS***** It's not ironic that there wasn't any backup when Murphy and Lewis confronted Clarence Bodicker's (sp) violent gang, but there was an army of cops readily available after Dick Jones called for help when Robo and the larger robot were trashing through his office. Why wasn't that army of cops available to take down Bodicker's gang, one asks? For same reason as above with the faulty body armor, where the hope is that cops will quit their post if they perceive it to be too dangerous and OCP will be granted absolute power by a scared population that *thinks* the company is looking out for the masses. Though, I must say, the one bit is when Murphy and Lewis decide to go after a gang of 8 violent robbers when they're told there's no back-up? I think NOT. There's brave and then there's stupid, and that kind of behavior is crossing the line towards the latter."

"*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "For some reason I have yet to understand, our school teacher decided that this film was suitable for 10 year olds, and brought it in for us to watch as an end of term treat. Of course, being only 10 at the time, and brought up on a TV diet of kids cartoons, I was completely traumatised by the experience. This lead to months of nightmares about people dissolving in toxic waste, and me becoming terrified of the twitchy microwave in our kitchen. Thanks Teach!! Anyway, Now I am 35, completely desensitised to violence in films and I stumbled across this on Netflix and decided to watch it again with adult perspective, to see if I really hated it as much as I thought I did. It is as gory as I remember so anyone looking for lots of blood, squishy corpses and explosions, this is the film for you! It hasn't aged well, but some of the effects are still decent. It is fun to revisit the 80s and all that 80's cheesy dialogue, obsolete technology and ridiculous bad guys, complete with a greedy, evil corporation running the show. Definitely worth a watch if you are into this genre. I'll be interested to see how the remake turns out." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "1987 was a significant year for action, sci-fi, and horror films, and on-screen violence conveyed as shocking, grotesque imagery moved many members of a more juvenile audience that year and more to follow. Paul Verhoven's \"Robocop\" is a perfect example of an excessively violent comic book sci-fi fantasy box office smash. Its a film that engraved itself into the consciousnesses of minds such as my own with a very modern interpretation of villains and archetypal heroes, good versus evil, and science versus humanity. Peter Weller is perfectly cast as good-hearted policeman, Alex Murphy, newly transferred to a futuristic Detroit where corporations rule, and crime has taken its toll. After he is cut down by ruthless bad guys, Murphy undergoes a transformation into a cybernetic super-cop equipped with the latest and greatest of futuristic technology, and must eventually take revenge against the gangsters that took away his human identity and confront his adversaries protected by the corporate hierarchy. Verhoven's vision is one of sheer brilliance, unexpectedly utilizing extreme violence to depict a world of viciousness and moral desensitization. Murphy's horrifying murder is so graphic, that it only sets the stage for his later exercises in revenge and retribution. The cast is absolutely top-notch, with Nancy Allen as Murphy's tough but caring partner, Ronny Cox as a white collar shark businessman, Miguel Ferrer as an amoral and ambitious executive, and Kurtwood Smith who steals the show as one of the most detestably amusing villains in modern movie history, Clarence Boddicker. Superb directorial touches include excellent point-of-view camera work, hilarious spoof-style in-movie commercials and news reels, and plenty of twisted dialog and comic relief. Weller's performance provides the man versus machine human story and the ED-209 prototype (although stop-motion FX seem dated), is a blast. \"Robocop\" is a solid example of a coming of age tale of brutality and bloodshed, giving audiences of the extreme action genre exactly what it came for with plenty of surprises and no-holds-barred thrills. With all the computer graphics and 3D enhancements of today, they just don't make them like this anymore, and when Robo unleashes his fury on old Detroit, you'll buy that for a dollar! The unrated Director's cut is the way to go, with the extended Murphy killing (complete with rotating camera head shot). Verhoven will go on to direct \"Total Recall\" and \"Basic Instinct\" and Peter Weller and the surviving cast will return for an entertaining sequel, \"Robocop 2\"." "The 1980's were and are a treasure trove for action movie lovers who were blessed with an abundance of classic action tales ranging from Terminator, Lethal Weapon, Die Hard and countless other flicks that looked to take names and ask questions later. Dutch wild child Paul Verhoeven's 1987 bout of robotic justice can sit proudly alongside those classic entries as a shamelessly fun and over the top piece of blood infused entertainment. For some unbeknown reason I have in my many years of film watching never seen Peter Weller strut his stuff as Alex Murphy a man who becomes our titular Robocop (a fact made all the more shameful on my behalf considering I was holed up working in a video store for more than 5 years) but I am glad I have now rectified that problem. Robocop is a film filled with subtle smarts and ingenious ideas that were fantastically realised by Verhoeven with some ripping makeup design and typically brutal 1980's action scenes littering the picture. There is an air of fun and playfulness throughout the picture that are all infrequent in today's action films with Robocop not afraid to lighten the mood along with mixing in themes that are more meaningful and heartfelt, a mood that is heightened by a cast full of colourful and committed actors. Peter Weller in the role he will always be remembered for is great as our hero Murphy, playing the man and machine with an always calm yet readily menacing presence. As he quips his way through the movie we are always on his side and that's without the film bothering with much exposition at all. Other actors in the piece from Nancy Allen's female cop Anne and Kurtwood Smith's downright slimy Clarence J. Boddicker. All make their characters there's which fits in fantastically with Verhoeven's at times ingenious direction. When you watch Robocop today you really get the sense that even though it has now happened a remake/reboot is entirely unnecessary with the original still standing up in today's standards and still packing both a punch in the entertainment and social commentary stakes. If you're thinking about going to see the new Robocop why not just watch the original instead? As they say the original is always the best. 4 steps out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com" "When I look at the modern day West, and the 2008 financial crisis, I often see parallels with images from RoboCop: protests, mind-numbing commercials, crime as the result of huge poverty, profit as the main goal of life, no matter at what (or whose) expense. There is not one OCP today, but dozens of OCPs, huge modern mega-corporations that influence every aspect of the society and drain it of its wealth. Just like in RoboCop, the middle class is almost gone and we only have the poor and the rich. RoboCop started out as a pure B-movie, but unlike Cyborg (1989) or The Six Million Dolar Man (1974), it kept its relevance, satire and sharpness precisely because it is so close to today that it hurts. Even as a kid, I somehow got that one of the messages of the film was how the power was slowly shifting from the government to the OCP. Let's be fair, though, Verhoeven sometimes directs a scene in a heavy, clumsy manner, and some cheap ideas slightly reduce my enjoyment whenever I re-watch this. Overall, this is still a strong film, and I stand behind what I say. Kurtwood Smith is one of the most fiendish villains of the 80s, and one of the most unorthodox ones, too, with those glasses, but we must also mention Peter Weller who is often overlooked under that armor, yet his stoic presence tells us everything we need to know. His Murphy is a character designed by the corporations, a being that is a product, not a being anymore. The way he finds his humanity, nonetheless, is still powerful. He defies the system, he defies the cold exploitation - and he becomes worthy to become recognized. And the ED-something-something robot is still cool as ever, too." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "For starters Robocop is an underrated and misunderstood movie by many. Yet if you watch this movie and see passed the dark sense of humour and ultra violence there is a story which is reflective of our world today. Robocop is a satire and a well thought out one at that. OCP represent the big corporations, Robocop/Murphy represents the human spirit and this is the irony of the movie that despite Murphy becoming almost entirely machine by the company they could not destroy his human side. Murphy did not become a mindless, emotionless product that is Robocop!! His human emotional side was still too strong and Murphy's emotional journey as Robocop and losing his contact with his family give this movie depth which makes the original movie vastly superior to the hollow sequels that followed. So the analogy here is business, power, money and technology attempt to dehumanise mankind but showing that eventually human spirit will win the day and essentially this aspect is most important in life. An increasing focus in today's society I believe. In the final sequence of the movie this is emphasised by the Old Man asking Robocop what his name is, to which he replies 'Murphy'!. He was no longer the machine he was Alex Murphy the man! OK so I have now analysised this movie at its core but on a more superficial level this movie is fantastic action flick with humour added in bundles. It has some very violent scene which will stick in the memory especially the murder of Murphy. The Robocop suit special effects are brilliant, with his machine pistol style handgun being iconic and symbolic of the Robocop character. The acting is very solid and believable. The stop motion effects of ED-209 are probably not up to today's standards but in my eyes give the movie an authentic 80's feel and add to its charm. The action sequences are all great and no shot in the movie is wasted and all of it is relevant. The adverts in the movie and news sequences also adds to the satirical value of the movie and give the movie a dark humour. This is a movie I would recommend to all sci-fi and action fans but I warn you this is not a movie for the faint hearted as it contains uncompromising violence and lots of foul language. Most importantly though this is a movie that has more depth than meets the eye and is really giving a message to the more observant viewer but can also cater for the more shallow movie watcher. This is a shame because Robocop is much more than guns, blood and bad language. Its a satire of the modern world and I highly recommend it!!" "Every now and then a film comes out with so much action and mayhem, that an audience member cannot tell weather they were anesthetized from the drama or made to feel numb from the killings and body count. I saw this film in the surround-sound theater and the explosions and gunfire sent me into a tail-spin. It was a good action film, but the level of ambivalent destruction reached a peak when one of the characters spoke of the deceased as a 'product' and not as a human being. The tale of \"Robo-Cop\" begins when our hero Officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) signs up to be a candidate for the Robo-cop project. A gang of vicious thugs, headed by Clarece Boddicker, (Kurtwood Smith) are on a murderous rampage through 'old Detroit' and have little compunction to kill police at every opportunity. One such opportunity occurs when Officer Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen) accidentally allows her partner to be gun-down and left for dead. Thus initiating the transformation from ordinary cop to Law Enforcement Robot, created by O.C.P. headed by none other than Dan O'Herlihy as President. Ronny Cox is superb as Dick Jones, VP. at O.C.P. But he is about to be rivaled by up and coming Bob Morton. (Miguel Ferrer) Great film. ****" "Quick, what do Peter Weller, Ray Wise, and Paul McCrane have in common? If you say they were all in RoboCop, you're all halfway there. What they also have in common was they all were in Day 5 of \"24\" (with McCrane's role partly expanded to Day 6). Besides those names other familiar faces include Ronny Cox (Beverly Hills Cop series), Nancy Allen (ex-husband Brian De Palma movies, I Wanna Hold Your Hand), Miguel Ferrer (\"Twin Peaks\"), and, in the movie's best role, Kurtwood Smith (\"That '70s Show\") as the main villain, Clarence Boddicker. While partially predictable, RoboCop has some of the most badass action in movie history with wonderful humorous touches throughout. Director Paul Verhoeven really keeps a constant pace during the chase scenes. Check out Leeza Gibbons as one of the news anchors in the TV clip sequences. This movie is most highly recommended." "Paul Verhoeven's \"Robocop\" looks and sounds a lot like James Cameron's \"The Terminator\" (1984) on initial glance, with a mechanized, half-man/half-machine creation placed inside an ultra-violent action plot. The key difference is: whereas Cameron doesn't have a satirical bone in his body, Dutch director Verhoeven does, and transforms \"Robocop\" into a fine-tuned blend of futurist comedy and riveting action violence. Detroit cop Murphy (Peter Weller) is ambushed and brutally executed by a gang of thugs (headed by Kurtwood Smith!); left for dead, he is seized upon by a corporate creep (Miguel Ferrer, patenting his sleazy screen persona) who transforms him into the titular character--a seemingly perfect and unstoppable crime-fighting machine. It goes without saying that there are more than a few complications, and when Robocop suffers flashbacks of Murphy's death, his world is turned upside-down. Verhoeven's sense of frenetic action direction is matched by the incisive satire of corporate politics, where money-hungry vultures like Ferrer and Ronny Cox subsidize gangsters and drug manufacturers; similarly, the vision of future-media (while outdated with its distinctly '80s fonts and graphics) possesses a sarcastic, desensitized attitude that is ironically fitting (the malfunction of a satellite that laser-fries 100 from space is shrugged off as no big deal)...and could there be a bit of foreshadowing to our SUV-obsessed populace that the car everyone wants is an SUX 6000? It may look like a conventional sci-fi/action flick on the surface, but \"Robocop\" has an intellectual pulse that makes its thrills all the more satisfying." "This is a very good film. It was excellent in the 80s, and it's excellent today. It ages so very well. Satirical, bathetic, funny, heroic, worrying, sharp... it goes on and on. Maybe in a few more years, this film will be viewed with increasing amazement, at being so very prophetic.... and salutary. The music is good, too. You probably don't notice it with first viewing, but later, you do. All the acting performances are good, and in later years we saw some of the actors reappear in prominent roles, but they never rang true as they were all bad baddies in Robocop. The only problem is that Weller has to go around for most of it with his face mostly covered. Such a waste. stay out of TROUBLE." "Law enforcement is a dangerous job for all police at the best of times. That is no more apparent than in the 1987 science-fiction movie, Robocop. After seeing this movie a few times I appreciate what it must be like to be a cop and what it is like to be the target of criminals, and at the mercy of the public they are protecting. Robocop allows us to see first-hand what it means to have your life 'robbed' away from you, then what it takes to right the wrong that has been committed. When a good cop, Alex Murphy, gets blown away by some ruthless criminals, innovative scientists and doctors are able to piece him back together as an unstoppable crime-fighting cyborg called 'Robocop'. Impervious to bullets and bombs, and equipped to with high-tech weaponry, Robocop quickly makes a name for himself by cleaning up the crime-ridden streets of violence-ravaged Detroit. But despite his new, hardened exterior, Robocop is tormented by scraps of memory of his former life, and relives vivid nightmares of his own death at the hands of the vicious killers. Now he is out to seek more than justice.he wants revenge! I am fascinated by Robocop director Paul Verhoeven. His direction style is pretty good, with his most famous work being Basic Instinct, a movie I did like. I am sure that this movie took along time to direct, and I also know that Verhoeven was very 'hands-on' directing it. However he has a very weird mind, especially with his obsession about the crucifix. In Robocop, Verhoeven said 'I wanted to show Satan killing Jesus', in reference to the character of Alex Murphy. I question this man's morals and values, as they are very confronting. His fascination with violence is also a very hard thing to understand. The other people involved in making 'Robocop' were screenwriters Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner, who wrote a wonderful script for this movie. The hero of the film was especially well written. The people who were involved in making the 'Robocop' suit, had an arduous task, but did it beautifully. The suit was designed by Rob Bottin. I am sure he would have had to put a lot of thought into what and how the suit would be like. Actor Peter Weller had the difficult, but enviable task of being Police Officer Alex Murphy/Robocop. I feel that he was a great choice for being 'the knight in shining armor'. The way he makes us believe that he is a robot is terrific, as is the way that he brings a human side to his other personality. I recently saw Weller in the movie 'Styx', starring alongside Aussie actor Bryan Brown. 'Robo's' partner is female cop Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen). Her character remains loyal to Robocop, because when other people believe Alex Murphy is 'dead', Lewis knows her old partner is inside that machine somewhere. There are some really bad characters in Robocop. Robert 'Bob' Morton (Miguel Ferrier) would seem to be on the side of good, as he is the one responsible for making 'a man become a robot'. However it also evident that he is only doing it for his own gain. The meanest character on this film was a man by the name of Clarence Boddicker, (Kurtwood Smith). His character has no conscience, as he goes around Detroit killing innocent cops without blinking an eye. He is doing this under the evil instructions of OCP employee Richard 'Dick' Jones (Ronny Cox). By the end of the movie you are willing that Dick and the bad guy are blown away by Robocop. I would describe the scenes to this movie as being either 'gruesome or heroic'. Alex Murphy's death is one of the most challenging pieces of cinema I have ever seen, as was the introduction of Police robot 'Ed 209'. When Ed goes haywire, killing an innocent man, once again the violence is very confronting for the audience. This scene also shows the subtle use of comedy. After shutting down the robot, a person calls out for a 'paramedic' to help the dead man. This was very humorous, as the man was more than just 'dead', and makes what was something so violent seem to be just a joke. By the end this movie, I felt very desensitised by the violence, as if it were commonplace. This movie also has some heroic scenes. All of the screen time with Robocop seemed to make him feel like a hero, as we are all willing him to do his job, by being a tough indestructible police officer. My favourite two 'Robo-scenes' are one, when Robocop confronts one of his killers at a 'Shell' gas station, and two, when our hero uncovers a major drug raid, again involving the scum that ended Alex Murphy. I also like the soundtrack to 'Robocop'. The Robocop 'march' highlights the status of our hero and these scenes. Yet we are also made to feel for this cyborg. I like how we see him revisit his former home, and what affect his 'human brain' has. This robot is still very vulnerable and disturbed by what has happened to him in the past as a human. It is a known fact that people hated working on this movie, which is understandable. I am sure it would have been demanding, on and off screen. Peter Weller also openly admitted that being 'Robocop' was the worst experience of his acting life, simply because of the costume that he had to wear. I was not surprised to hear that. Yet he gave the Robocop figure great 'heart' which it needed. This movie will test your threshold for violence, as it is 'cynical and unblinking'. It will also make you feel good, as the main star is a 'likeable' robot. Watch out for the wonderful DVD which is now available for this movie. For an 80's movie, Robocop was a very good one.

"Sharp, ultra-violent (particularly the director's cut) and undeniably funny (if you're into this kind of) action/science fiction set in a not too distant Detroit, Michigan future (though actually filmed in Houstan, Texas) where crime runs rampant and people sell out regularly for the sake of the all mighty dollar. One particularly annoying criminal is Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith, who later went on to play the cranky dad Red Foreman on TV's \"That 70s Show\") a sadistic drug dealer who secretly works for OCP (Omni-Consumer Products) 2nd in command Dick Jones (Ronny Cox). Jones tries to sell a new state of the art security robot called ED-209 (Enforcement Droid), but ED malfunctions and kills a young executive during demonstration so the Old Man/OCP President (Daniel O'Herlihy) gives the green light to up and comer Bob Morton's (a much younger Miguel Ferrer who actually has hair) ROBOCOP program, which is supposed to blend a dead policeman's flesh and experience with those of a machine. Later that day, family man Police Offer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is brutally mutilated by Clarence and his gang of sadistic scum-bags, much to the horror of his lady partner Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen). Murphy is then resurrected with a blanked memory as Robocop, a hulking, 6-foot tall cyborg, heavily armored and wielding a big gun. After being unveiled and thwarting a machine gun toting convenience store robber (who tries to pick up an Iron Man comic book along with the robbery), shooting a rapist in the balls and throwing a blood thirsty ex-city councilman out of a window thus saving the mayor, Robocop becomes a sensation and security factor in securing revitalizing Old Detroit as part of a big city project (Delta City or something). This angers Jones and he swears revenge on Morton. Later Robocop (who only Lewis recognizes as Murphy) has a dream/flashback to his brutal murder which freaks out his personal technicians before he goes off for his nightly patrol. While out on patrol he encounters Emil (Paul McCrane), one of Clarence's thugs while he's robbing and terrorizing a gas station attendant and, after a voice from beyond the grave moment, the gas station is blown sky high and Robocop shoots down Emil's bike, demanding his identity. Later Robocop checks out Emil and his known accomplices, which leads to him coming across Clarence and one of his murdered victims, Alex Murphy. After Robocop goes back to his old home and regains enough memories of his previous life to realize that HE IS Murphy, he becomes enraged and hellbent on beating the crap out of Clarence and his minions any which way he can. The only thing standing in his way are his prime directives - 1) Serve the public trust, 2) Protect the Innocent, 3) Uphold the law and \"Directive 4\" (no attackng senior OCP staff members), OCP man Jones and ED-209. Did I mention that the other cops are trying to go on strike? Naturally, since this is a feel good 80s movie, Robocop naturally triumphs over evil and destroys Clarence and his minions. Peter Weller is mesmerizing as Robocop, Kurtwood Smith is a threatening villain (my ability to enjoy this film has been hampered somewhat by Smith's role on \"That 70s Show\") and Jones is a charming villain. Nancy Allen does capable work as Lewis. Sadly, what could have been a great franchise was ruined by kid oriented toy marketing, \"Robocop 2\", which had a plot that just didn't go anywhere, the unnecessary presence of a sadistic, foul mouthed boy who we're expected to feel sorry for when he dies and an obnoxious, manipulative conniving little bitch who doesn't get her just desserts played by Belinda Bauer (who's only acting ability IS conniving little bitch) and \"Robocop 3\" which turned Robocop into a joke and didn't even feature Peter Weller as Robocop. At least \"Robocop 2\" had some cool action scenes and cool music Leonard Rosenbaum (or Rosenman, I forget how you spell his name). Still, \"Robocop 1\" is a classic of the action/science fiction genre and features numerous memorable pot shots at capitalism run rampant along with the whole humanity VS technology thing and when it stops being a machine and becomes a person. Music by Basil Pouldouris, who also did the music for \"Conan the Barbarian\". Stand out stop motion special effects by Phil Tippet." "Robocop along with Lethal Weapon and Predator were the three action films of 1987. Robocop is about a law officer(peter weller) who is killed on the line of duty and is resurrected by a greedy company called OCP(omni consumer products)and the man responsible is Bob(Miguel Ferrer) who is being challanged by Dick Jones(Ronny Cox) with the same idea but different structures. Dick has his own design called Ed-209, a 10 foot robot with cannons the size of gas tanks for pick up trucks. With Robocop in action, the city is safe, until his past as a human gets him to get even with the people that kill him. great action movie with funny dialogue and humor along the way, Robocop proves to be one of the greatest action movies ever made." "Paul Verhoven, who originally turned this project down, must have known what a big joke this film was going to be if made right. But exactly right is how he's made it, as it's the kind of joke that one wants to get told by someone who knows how to tell it, so that one can remember how it goes to tell the next guy. It lays in its satire in sharp stabs that are wickedly dead-on, as far as consumerism and living in a state of decay by the media and complete omniscient (and sinister in playing both sides) corporate control goes, with commercials for 'Nukem', a variation on battleship, and a dinosaur-attacking-a-city movie coming soon, which comes at the strangest of time in the story. In fact, RoboCop in a big way can be seen as the older cousin of Starship Troopers, and to a smaller extent Total Recall, Verhoven's other futuristic sci-fi ventures: the society itself, which is encompassed with authorities, the corporate interests, the criminals, the cops with their low morale and high body count (cops deaths, not criminals), lends itself to being led on to get dominated by technology. What RoboCop brilliantly posits is that when the human element is suppressed in a society driven head-on by mindless and lethal technology, it's bound to come out somehow in some form. Just so happens Murphy (Peter Weller) is that form. The simple lowdown: Murphy and his female cop partner are out chasing some bad guys, they track them down to a warehouse where Murphy is captured, shot repeatedly (his hand gets shot off first, then past the bullet proof vest), and killed...Or so it seems, as he's not totally dead, and is brought back to life, though not really. In a series of first-person perspectives- a real inventive way to show passage of time as well as a level of cynical manipulation in the guise of wild progress in making a human-robot- we see Murphy turned into Robocop, his arms replaced, a gridding and shooting system loaded in, and finally taking his first steps. Like any superhero, RoboCop is a kick-ass force to be reckoned with, and completely objective: he's there to serve and protect, and make the occasional PA for kids, \"Stay out of trouble.\" The same thugs from before however are still lurking around, and a run-in with one stirs memories, if not exactly feelings, of Murphy's demise, as well as the loss he feels for his wife and child. Little by little, a routine investigation/crackdown by Robocop turns into a sort of vendetta. This, unfortunately, stirs up wrath in the head of the OCP, who is, as luck would have it, also the boss of the big-hoodlums Robocop is after in Detroit's glummest of slums. It's worth to point out some of these story points, as Verhoven and the writers are actually very strong on pushing forward the story, but in a level that makes material that should be in a 25 cent pulpy comic book from the 50s into something more tangible. Like the Terminator, Verhoven keeps the adrenaline going forward as far as directing the action set-pieces, from small scenes with liquor store robberies, to a big crackdown of Clarence's drug operation, and to a scene involving many, many, many guns firing on Robocop in one fell swoop. But there's often an attitude to action, specifically the \"excessive violence\" (as the MPAA put it when it gave the film an X at first sight), that reminds the audience that it's bigger than life, like a movie should be like this, and at the same time graphic enough to point out the very chaotic nature of gang warfare. It's a thin line that Verhoven and his collaborators walk on and pull off tremendously, in making scenes that should be horribly horrific, like when the big walker-gun-machine is introduced and kills one of the board members, hilarious in the darkest possible way in how they unfold, and at the same time keep excitement to it, of the kind of danger one saw in Death Wish (and, like that film, Detroit's crime scene is probably not far from the one depicted here). And when it comes down to it too, RoboCop/Murphy is the kind of big-screen hero that audiences can get behind, if after a slight adjustment to the whole goof that comes in just picturing a Robocop before it comes on screen. There's tragedy inherent to Murphy's original demise, hence the sort of bitter edge of the first-person creation scenes, especially because Robocop's creators didn't work out making it a figure that is entirely robot. Programming stays the same, but the past ends up informing the character, and brings what is otherwise a walking bill-of-rights machine with a big (bleeping) gun to being human again, in its black-and-white manner. In his own kind of twisted way, this is for Verhoven what Brazil is for Terry Gilliam; a near-future plausible not for the advances in technology (or lack thereof), but because of human beings not being able to know how to function society, and what a consciousness in technology brings to the situation. This as well as each director's obsessions, in this case Verhoven's knack at shameless artifice, bigger than life bad guys, twists in the plot, and a lot of bombastic violence. And all the same, it's an rip-roaring adult popcorn movie, one of the best of 1987." "Remember watching this movie as a schoolboy at home on small TV screen from an old VHS-player. Through a very small TV-set, with crappy sound, and crappy picture. But it still blew me away. The story, the settings, the special effects, the dramatic events, the gloomy violence, and insane breaking of the law did not let my mind go from the first frames till the very last. There was information once in our Soviet magazines that the movie had been originally shown in the USA to people of 21 and older only. Wow! And the movie does not have any serious sexual material. A darn good movie. A sci-fi of the first rate. A classic. A little picture that changed my attitude to sci-fi action genre forever. \"The Terminator\", \"Predator\", \"RoboCop\", and a few others are really the iron fist of the genre. The biggest achievement of the American culture. Guess what? Yes, 10 out of 10. Sequels do not matter, but the original does big time. Thank you for attention." "Since I was born in the late seventies, I missed a lot of classic movies as a kid and in the eighties there just weren't made that many excellent movies. But if you ask me to name on of the movies that I saw then and which I still like, than chances are that it will be this \"Robocop\". It looked great back then, but still hasn't lost any of its power today. In a futuristic Detroit, violence is everywhere. The police department isn't able to react in a proper way and every week several officers get killed in the line of duty. But a private company called OPC may have come up with an excellent alternative for a police officer. They have developed E.D. 209, a powerful and huge crime fighting robot that can be used 24 hours a day. The only problem is that the robot doesn't always do its task correctly and sometimes shoots an innocent man. So it isn't used and the human cops will have to keep doing the dirty work. While Officer Alex J. Murphy goes on his first patrol, he is ambushed and shot by the feared gang leader and cop killer Clarence Boddicker. In the hospital they try to save Murphy's life, but when that appears to be impossible, his body is used by OPC to develop an entirely new robot. They use him to create the much better RoboCop. He is very successful against criminals, but when memories of his former life begin to surface, he starts looking for revenge... I guess that many people who now see this movie for the first time might say that some special effects could have been better. Especially the scenes with the E.D. 209 don't always look perfect (as long as it stands still, it all looks OK, but when it moves you see that the special effects weren't what they are today). Personally I didn't really have any problem with that because I kept in mind that this is still a movie from 1987. Let's be honest, in 20 years time today's special effects will probably look dated as well. But a good thing about this movie is that it didn't just rely on its special effects. The story is more than OK, and even though written almost two decades ago, still looks futuristic enough to be believable. A good thing about the story is also the fact that they don't mention a date. Some eighties Sci-Fi movies say: 'in the year 2002...' Back then that may have felt futuristic, special and believable, but when you see it today, you know that it wasn't like that at all in 2002. But what would a good story be without some good directing and acting? Absolutely nothing. It wouldn't be the first movie to fail completely because one of those things wasn't exactly great. But not in this case: Paul Verhoeven established his name in Hollywood with this movie (which is completely understandable, although he never came up with another movie that great.) and actors like Peter Weller and Nancy Allen also did a very good job (although they too weren't able to come up with another excellent project). In the end this is a Sci-Fi / action movie that really stands out above the average movie in the genre. Normally I'm not a fan of this kind of movies, but this time I'm willing to make an exception. The acting and the directing were very good, the story still feels futuristic enough and believable... That's why I give this movie a 7.5/10." "Robocop (1987) *** (out of 4) This extremely entertaining and original action picture was a box-office hit when first released even though the controversy of its violence would cause a firestorm even after the MPAA took out several seconds of footage. The film takes place in a crime filled Detroit where various psychopaths are killing cops at an alarming rate. One mastermind (Kurtwood Smith) has killed over two dozen cops and adds Murphy (Peter Weller) to his life. A local company, building for the future, takes what's left of Murphy and turns him into the machine Robocop. What they don't expect is for the robot to have memories of his human life and soon he sets out for revenge. I think the reason this movie grabbed crowds in 1987 and remains so fresh today is that the screenplay really went for broke and tried to mix everything it could. Not only is it sci-fi and action but we also get a lot of nice humor scattered throughout the ultra-violence and gore soaked story. It also helps that the screenplay was smart enough to make sure it builds up our human cop to where we care for him and want to see him get his revenge. It also helps that the bad guys here are among the greatest scum ever gathered in a movie. Smith is downright masterful as the head psycho and you can't help but want to see this guy beaten to a bloody pulp and the same holds true for his supporting cast. Weller is very good in his role as both the human cop as well as the machine. Nancy Allen also adds nice support even though her role isn't all that big. Verhoeven does a terrific job at building up this futuristic setting but he also manages to make it quite dark and moody. I think people forget what a great director he can be and he really puts his mark on this film and especially with the graphic violence. Seeing this thing in its R-rated form is certainly not the way too go even if you can't stomach the strong violence." "This is the original Robocop movie. It is still a very good movie, and it is much better than the new version. Many years have past since this came out, and it still deserves to be in the top. Many of the new versions of old movies that come out is missing some of the good feeling due to so much special effects, but they are not always needed to be a great movie. All is there. Action, Sorrow and the thoughts afterwords. The story is great and still and perhaps it is not so long in the future that we have these robot cops. The movie is about the police officer Alex Murphy, who somehow turned out to be a robot cop. He struggles with his past and present and the movie is really thoughtful these days were robots turn up everywhere. The special effects are not that good but when you think of when the movie was made it is no problem and the story makes you to forget all of that. Do not miss it." "My reasons to love Robocop : 1 - The interesting argument , savage capitalism , the high crime of a futuristic city ; corporate corruption , privatization, the struggle of good against evil, greed, technology development , cruel villains , the hero, the police loyalty, social criticism , and light humor. 2 - The impeccable direction of Paul Verhoeven . 3 - The excellent performances from the entire cast . 4 - The wonderful special effects , effective cinematography, beautiful music by Basil Poledouris ; and great editing . 5 - The spectacular action sequences, graphic violence , and brutal death scenes . 6 - A police flesh is killed, loses his family , then the hero is resurrected , his body is steel, and the new hero fights against the worst of society, throughout the process the hero has a new identity in the film takes the theme of revenge and amnesia. 7- Brain-computer interfacing in fiction. Robocop is a perfect action film and science fiction." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Unfortunately, for me, I didn't first get involved with the lovable Robocop until part 2 came out in 1990. Since I was a kid then, and trying to watch as many movies as I possibly could at that age, I had a good time with Robocop 2. Now, I think I've seen it only once since 1990 and not again in over two decades, so we'll see when I revisit that movie. I digress. Speaking about Robocop, the original  and not the not-anticipated-by-me remake in 2014, I was way too young to see this when it came out in theatres. Oh, and I was banned for most Rated-R flicks, unless my parents just had to see a Rated-R film and they had no babysitter. When I finally did, of course, I fell in love with it. It was the perfect 1980s action movie  make that, superhero movie. Yeah, Robocop is a superhero and the movie had all the eight stereotypical qualities of one: 1. Introduce a peaceful do-gooder and abruptly (and literally) shoot him down. 2. Reintroduce him with special powers. 3. Show just a handful of \"saving the public\" examples. 4. Our hero learns more about himself while inadvertently, inventing a smart, wealthy and obviously evil nemesis to take down our hero. 5. Shoot the hero down, again. 6. Show examples of the evil nemesis's, ah-hem, evilness. 7. Have hero learn and regain confidence...and muscle. 8. A SUPERHERO is born and comes back with a vengeance in the climax. Now, technically, I didn't spoil anything there. This is literally the formula for most superhero movies, including one of my all-time superhero movies, 1978's Superman: The Movie. Oh, and this movie is now 26 years old. Get with it, if you haven't seen it! Generally, in my reviews, I cover the synopsis. Since, I did above, I can move on. I truly loved this movie. It never seems to age for me whenever I revisit it. Sure, there's a few 80s technology/animation  mostly by ED-209  that I can't get past and no remake next year will make me side with them to correct any budget issues here. The lines were great, the action (ah-hem) explosive, the comedy funny, the heart attached and it truly defined that era of films. This movie, if it has to be remade, which it doesn't, deserves better follow-ups. The sequels  now thinking back on them  were comical and the TV seriesI didn't even bother. After seeing the trailer for the 2014 remake (not reboot, because, likely, it'll go nowhere or make that much,) I'm not enthused. But, sticking with this Robocop, it'll be a classic to the end of days. Side Note: My headline reads: Robopop. The reason? When I was young, and we had one TV with limited channels  never had cable until I moved out and there was this Bob Hope special on where in one segment, he dressed as Robocop, but was these kid's Robopop. I thought that was the funniest thing at the time and it's stuck with me since. Perhaps, I should YouTube that to see if someone else agrees with me Side Note II: Okay, not on YouTube, or Google But, I'll always have that memory. Ahhh, the past." "I thought this movie would be a stinker. It reminded me of Blade Runner and contrary to most people, I didn't like that movie too much. So I was skeptical about seeing this. However, that skepticism didn't last long. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie. This movie is about a young cop who was brutally murdered. He is resurrected as part human, part robot. In his new life, he goes after the people who murdered him. The acting is very good. I enjoyed the performances by Peter Weller, Ronny Cox, and Miguel Ferrier. Overall, this is an enjoyable action/sci-fi movie. This movie is very violent though. I rate this film 8/10."

"*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "When I was a kid, the word \"Robocop\" would bring into mind a silly robot policeman who talked funny (thanks Robocop 3). When I grew older,I saw the first \"Robocop\" and all I could say that I was blown away just like Peter Weller's Hand. I never thought that a movie about a very cartoonish-looking character could be so vicious and brutal. Peter Weller's mutilation was disturbing and his revenge as Robocop provide equally stomach-churning tableaux of undiluted nastiness. Aside from the gruesome set pieces, we are also treated to violent gun battles punctuated by bloody arterial sprays from each unlucky victim. But \"Robocop\" does't only exist to show us a human hand being blasted in graphic detail by a shotgun, it also serves as a biting, funny social commentary on how consumerism and capitalism have morally downgraded our society. This is evident in the \"infomercials\" that pop out of the film from time to time, which advertises bizarre and violent entertainment for the enjoyment of the entire family.(like that nuclear war game) what's good is that Verhoeven actually maintains the films unique mood throughout the film. The combination of violent splatter and social commentary is evident when the dumb robot, the ED-209, splatters an executive all over the place. The old man's( Dan O'Herlihy) response? \"Dick, I'm very disappointed.\" Films like this not only entertains us with violent action, it also takes its time to make us laugh as society spirals downward. ROBOCOP FOR TOP 250!!!" "Yes, the guy who did this movie would later make Starship Troopers, here though I think is a more realistic take on a future society. A rather violent society, a place where the average cop just is not enough so they try to make a super cop. First, they try a totally robotic one with very deadly yet somehow darkly comic results. Since this one fails another person gets to try it his way and they make this robotic cop using the remains of an officer who is simply gunned down in a most brutal and unpleasant way. So the officer goes out on his beat and takes out criminals very effectively albeit a bit emotionless. His former partner though jogs his memory and all hell breaks loose at a factory where we have a very cool fight that even involves a dude getting toxic waste on himself. Then you have a conclusion that while not as great as the factory fight is still rather cool and a bit funny as well. So there you have it, Peter Weller does a rather good job as Robocop, Nancy Allen is okay too, but nothing special. Good villains too, but I can not really say if I remember seeing them in other movies other than Ronny Cox as if has been awhile since I have seen this movie. Though as a kid I thought this movie was the bomb as I saw it at the theater. Did not care for the fake commercials in it though." "Usually I don't like thin, action movies. However, RoboCop is far from thin. The plot here is actually quite complex. In the near future, Detroit is a city packed with crime, and the normal police aren't enough to stop it. The police force is bought out by a big corporation, Omni Consumer Products (O.C.P.), and they have new plans for the police force to stop the crime. Their answer? RoboCop. The performances here were excellent. Peter Weller was entertaining as Officer Murphy (RoboCop). Nancy Allen was good as Officer Lewis, Murphy's partner. Dan O'Herlihy was perfect as The Old Man, the owner of OCP. Ronny Cox was good as Dick Jones, the #2 person of OCP. Miguel Ferrer was great as Bob Morton, the OCP executive who creates RoboCop. And Kurtwood Smith was great as Clarence Boddicker, the unofficial \"crime boss' of Old Detroit. Besides great acting, there are great effects, costumes and props. Making this movie much MUCH more than a thin, no-plot action movie. RoboCop is very entertaining and should appeal to nearly all audiences. 9/10." "RoboCop was one of the first R rated movies I ever saw as a child. Back when they had this allure of being forbidden and dangerous. I'll freely admit I was much too young to catch its satire and a lot of the plot points flew right over my head. I was more affected (and to a degree traumatized) by its graphic violence and the horrible circumstances of Murphy's fate. But the film stuck with me. It was such a compelling character surrounded by equally interesting supporting characters. The villain gave me nightmares and I was flat out terrified of him. It was also one of the first movies with morally ambiguous individuals I'd ever seen. Until then the good guys were good and the bad guys were bad. But it wasn't that simple in RoboCop. And even at that young age that resonated with me. As I got older I began to appreciate the film on entirely other levels. And now, at 25 I love it even more. What we have here is something that could easily have turned into straight to video silliness. A mediocre script and laughable concept made into something revolutionary by great film-making. The lower points on Paul Verhoeven's resume can be forgiven because of gems like this. So many of the sequences in this film are just brilliantly shot and conceived (Murphy's death, the slow introduction to RoboCop, the Rock Shop bust, and the entire third act). He took subpar material and managed to shape it into so much more. But Verhoeven doesn't deserve all the credit. Peter Weller's performance is suitabaly repressed but somehow still so emotive. Not an easy task when all the audience sees is the lower half of your face. Kurtwood Smith takes corny and clichéd dialogue and makes it haunting and believable. The film has a down and dirty tone that no subsequent versions of the franchise have ever matched. There's beauty in its brutality and a cohesiveness sorely missing in the sequels. It feels epic and intimate at the same time. It's imaginative and awe inspiring. There were so many places to go with this character and so many possibilities. It's a shame the films and TV series that followed wasted all of them. Now the franchise inspires laughs and is all but dead. It's too bad because it's easy to forget how powerful and truly rock solid this first entry is." "In the near future of Detroit City. The major corporation \"OCP\" wants to built an Cyborg by making the perfect futuristic Police Officer. One day, Police Officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is killed on the line of duty by an ruthless gang of murdering/thieves (Lead by Kurtwood Smith). The \"OCP\" finds the perfect candidate by using several body parts of Murphy of their division. When \"OCP\" actually succeed by creating the perfect law enforcer and the cyborg is been called Robocop. Robocop becomes very successful with the public and the media, they think Robocop is the Ultimate Defender of Justice. Until the mind of Murphy has resurrected on Robocop and now taking personal revenge on the thugs, who murdered him. Directed by Paul Verhoeven (Black Book, Basic Instinct, Showgirls) made an thrilling, extremely well made violent film with plenty of action, humour, emotions and soul. Weller gives an solid believable performance as Murphy/Robocop in this instant classic film. The script is very clever and original as well. This film also stars Nancy Allen, Dan O'Herlihy, Miguel Ferrer, Ray Wise and Paul McCrane. Verhoeven's movie is an stylized cop-thriller.

"*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "i liked this movie quite a bit.it's very well paced,the acting is pretty good and it is ultra violent.it's basically about a part human,part cyborg cop who cleans up the streets of the city.there are some glitches along the way,of course.i think the movie,at its heart is a social satire.it's very relevant,even more so today.there are touches of irony and humour through out.Paul Verhoeven directed it and it's his first Americna movie.Verhoeven doesn't shy away from violence and if that sort of thing bothers you,you'll want to skip this movie.there is another,maybe more futuristic robotic cop,which i really like the look of.(possible minor spoiler ahead)there are two showdowns between RoboCop and this other futuristic,more advanced robot,both of which i found exciting and well done.for,me RoboCop is an 8/10" "I can't say that Paul Verhoeven is one of my favorite directors, but I have to admit that he definitely has a sense of humour. Robocop is a type of title that would make it sound like the dumbest thing on the planet or at the very least \"Diet Terminator\". Luckily the film is neither of these things. Robocop combines a rather standard action film with an interesting political message. A serious film is the best kind of satire and the various elements that make up the gritty tale of Robocop are what make it rather distinct in its B-film class. It is a violent film with a lot of heart. The 80s cheese-factor is noticeable in the film but luckily most of the film was shot very impressively and Robo himself only has a few moments of cheesy method-twitching. I was rather blown away by the quality of the stop-motion animation. In all Robocop is rather unusual film. It does not quite rise to the level of stand-out hits in the genre but is a notable film in its own right and definitely an enjoyable cinematic experience." "Robocop was a definite commercial success both in the United States and overseas. It has since become a classic example of the futurist genre alongside such great films as The Road Warrior, Blade Runner, and the much overlooked Charleton Heston classic Soylent Green. The thematic intertextuality of these films is clear, as they all deal in one way or another with issues such as overpopulation, the deterioration of the human lifestyle, consumerism and the corporation as the root of all evil. Robocop has earned it's place in popular culture as a prime example of its genre and has been nominated for Academy Awards in film editing and sound. Director Paul Verhoeven won the Saturn award in 1988 for his work on Robocop, and the film went on to receive more than a dozen awards and nominations including BAFTA and the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films. Robocop has become a classic meditation on the detritus of modernity, and reminds us not to lose our humanity in the rat race of the post industrial world." "This movie is both a reason not to lose hope in Hollywood, and at the same time painfully reminds us how tame, boring and stupid most of the action genre has become. Paul Verhoeven never used more efficiently the unparalleled resources Hollywood has to offer. With a decent - but not overblown - budget, he manages to show a spectacular display of action and great special effects that you can still watch today without laughing, unlike many other 80's movies. The story (a cop working in a corruption-ridden society is brutally murdered and turned into a robotic law enforcer) is fairly simple, and in other hands could've ended like many other childish action movies. But the satiric tone and the full-frontal violence not only validates the humor, but helps the audience to understand the social critic without hammering it down. It's a moral tale, but certainly not a lecture. The unbelievable boldness of the tone and the nifty execution turns this sci-fi/political pamphlet into a \"Clockwork Orange\"-like phenomenon. It's not aimed at kids, but if the brutality wasn't so over-the-top it should be shown to the youngest moviegoers, as the REAL action movie. No over-use of CGI. No annoying sidekick. No stupid humor or \"satisfactory\" ending. No compromise. The 21st century truly NEEDS a movie like this. Not a remake, or a reboot, or whatever fancy name the studios come up with. Just a new kind of no-nonsense, clever, ambitious big budget movies that doesn't insult the audience's intelligence for a change. To settle the score with subsequent shallow Hollywood flicks whose makers brag about carrying on RoboCop's legacy while reaching for the lowest common denominator (\"Iron Man\", anyone?). To set a new standard in blockbusters, an alternative to silly, brainwashing and heartless \"entertainment\". The sooner's the better." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Saw this in the cinema and have seen it numerous of times since. Fantastic from second one with an incredible story and super cast. The story of how technology has created the ultimate Super Cop. Poor Alex Murphy is gunned down by scumbag criminals and is recreated into RoboCop. The city is overrun by criminals and the hope is that RoboCop can bring some order to chaos. Peter Weller puts on a fine performance as RoboCop as his memories creep back of who he is and of who 'killed' him. Action is brilliant and eye pleasing as much as is the bloodshed!! Kurtwood Smith puts on an excellent show as Clarence Bodicker, the main bad guy too. The whole story of vengeance and corruption is so well versed in this movie and will certainly please all! Watch the director's cut for a real treat if you've seen this! Such a shame about the multitude of follow ups though........"

"oh my god what a movie!!! i was only 8 when this hit the cinemas in the UK so my 1st viewing was 9 when it was on VHS everyone at school was raving on about it and one day my dad came in drunk with a copy from the video rental store. i was scared at 1st given its 18 rating but when i seen it all the way through i was soon bouncing round the house thinking i was robocop shouting \"your move creep\" to any of my other toys that would listen. now as an adult watching it i can appreciate everything all over again including storyline,characters,plot and direction even to this day i still get that nostalgic 80's feel of the movie. granted it looks slightly outdated now and you can clearly tell its just a man in a suit but even to this day and for anyone who has not yet seen it there is something fascinating about the robocop character from the way he looks and moves to the great acting from peter weller robocop is like your dark side of a superhero for the more adult audience. if you love your 80's sci-fi movies then this is one of the greatest up the with the likes of 'the terminator' i have had many favourite movies I've loved over the years since robocop but this movie will always have a special place in my heart. a must and i mean MUST own DVD!!!" "When Alex J. Murphy (Peter Weller) is killed in the line of duty, OCP scientists put his brain into the ultimate law enforcement battle droid however when he starts remembering who he was, he sets out to avenge his brutal execution and along the way much blood spills. What makes Robocop such a classic is because the movie is more than just a good action flick. It has genuine ideas, black humor, excellent satire and an unpredictability that shows up most in the genre. Also there is a depth to the sequences where Peter Weller wonders what he's become and there is a really powerful scene where Weller walks into his house he owned when he was human, and his memories come flooding back. It's a mix of drama, humor and action that works to extreme satisfaction and although Robocop sometimes goes to excess, there is no denying that it is one of the best science fiction movies of the 80s. But what really makes this brilliant is mainly the acting and the characters, all of the characters are sketched out three dimensionally and the film gets it's moments of heart out of Weller's excellent performance. * * * * out of 4-(Excellent, a must see!)" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This is one of those movies you see again and again. Peter Weller portrays an police officer who gets shot a million times and dies. but then company officials decide to make a \"Robocop\" out of him. The quotes in this movie are endless and memorable! like: \"Rape Victim: Oh God, I was so scared! Thank you! RoboCop: Madame, you have suffered an emotional shock. I will notify a rape crisis center.\" In many ways this is a fun movie to watch, and there's plenty of action to go around to. So if you and your friends want some thrills and some laughs, i highly recommend \"Robocop\". 20 years after its release it's still as entertaining and memorable as it was then!" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Big words, perhaps, but in this case they are undoubtedly true. To compare RoboCop to films such as Casablanca, The Godfather or Rain Man would be foolish, but it easily ranks with these classics, even though it of course a very different film. RoboCop is probably looked upon as simply another sci-fi action film. A very good one, perhaps, but no more than that. To those who don't know a lot about films it is indeed probably a rather silly film about a man in a tin can shooting people. Indeed, on the surface, it pretty much is. Looking deeper the film it is clearly something of a revenge film, about a cop who is brutally murdered and comes back to avenge his death. But at the heart of the film, RoboCop is a story about the human spirit and how, despite however many mechanical additions are made to a person, they are still the same man underneath. Murphy is a regular cop, with a wife who he loves dearly and a son who he loves and tries to make happy, even if it is just through the simplest of things like imitating his son's favourite television character. He is of course though brutally murdered by a gang of thieves, and when he returns months later, is a cyborg law enforcer(a product of corporate America, in essence) who, despite the best efforts of the company who 'built' him (OCP), underneath all of the fancy new equipment he is still the same cop that began the film. Indeed, on his very first day on active duty (before he sets foot out of the police station, even) Murphy displays that, as he holsters his gun the same way as he had been practicing for his son. Slowly RoboCop, still only suspecting his true origins, pieces together his life as Murphy, and in the final act of the film, eventually comes to the inevitable conclusion that he was Murphy, and indeed still is Murphy. Thus, RoboCop is not simply a ghost in a machine, he is in fact a human being; the very same human being who started the film, albeit in a different body. As for RoboCop ranking up with some of the greatest films ever made, the answer is relatively simple. Now that we have discovered the true meaning of the film, we then realise how well put together the whole film actually is, from opening to closing. Not a scene is wasted, as every line spoken and every bullet fired (of which there are a lot) contribute to the film in a way that most action scenes do not. Whilst the same can be said for a lot of films (from Shawshank to Road House) it cannot usually be said for an 80s Action film, especially one that is predominantly played so seriously. Indeed, there are only a few times when the film invokes moment of excess and comic book-style violence. But this is always to get the point across. The ED-209 boardroom sequence, where the robot malfunctions and utterly obliterates a member of the board (and the following line \"somebody call a paramedic!\" when the man had been shot hundreds of times), is simply showing how warped corporate America has become. The same can be said for many of the films most violent scenes, such as Emil not only melting alive from the toxic waste, but then being run over and exploding like a water balloon, and even Murphy's own death at the hands of Clearance's gang, where Verhoeven just pushes the scene into ludicrous proportions when Murphy's entire right arm is blown off; although it is a scene of horror, when the arm goes one is almost forced to laugh as it is simply so silly. The violence isn't there to be 'cool,' it is a metaphor for the ridiculousness of many aspects of American society. And unlike most robot/cyborg films, the central character is not an unstoppable, cool and morally correct individual. RoboCop is a flawed human being, encased in a metal shell, trying to come to terms with his new existence (never has an actor invoked such a tearful performance using just his jawline), and whose actions are often morally ambiguous; for example, every time he stops a crime he does a lot more damage than the criminal was doing (destroying the convenience store, blowing up the petrol station etc.). The political and social satire, the brutal graphic violence, the tragedy of the main character, the special effects (which at the time were groundbreaking, and really haven't dated too badly at all), the brilliant main theme and the message of the film all place it among the very best that cinema has produced. Paul Verhoeven is a master director, and RoboCop is undoubtedly his (American?) masterpiece. To conclude, then, RoboCop is an action film with a heart, so much so that it is in no way shameful to cry at the last exchange of the film: \"Nice shooting, son. What's your name?\" \"Murphy.\"" "Being a cop can be dangerous, being a cop in the future can be twice as dangerous. Peter Weller does an spectacular job as \"Robocop\". Weller is Alex Murphy, a very dedicated cop who get transfered to the most heated precinct of Detroit. And on the first day of his job, he gets gunned down brutally by Boddicker(Kurtwood Smith) and his henchmen. His partner Officer Annie Lewis(Nacy Allen) rushes him to a hospital. There he becomes a perfect candidate for a cybernetic design fit for him: \"Robocop\". This piece of work may just give Steve Austin a run for his money. 10 times more durable, very accurate, and somewhat struggle to find out more secrets about the company who made him. I liked the parts where the would-be thief is taken care of swiftly, and the other part where he shot the would-be sex offender in the groin through her skirt! Apparently, she didn't care about her skirt, she was just grateful that she was rescued. Then, I liked the scene where he told one of the men who shot him to \"DROP IT!\" Those ED-209 droids were fun to watch, they were very flawed, because of the malfunctioning. It took the heavy gun to put it out of commission. Even battle-damaged, Robocop lived up to its name. Avery good sci-fi movie. And Ford got a lot of credit with their cars. I enjoyed this movie very much! 4 out of 5 stars!" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "The setting is futuristic Detroit.

Robert Morton a young yuppie like OCP employee, then presents his idea to the owner for creating a smaller, easier to control, but much more efficient, cyborg model, if only they could find the perfect specimenthis all comes to them, in the form of family man & fellow police officer ALEX MURPHY (PETER WELLER) who has re-located with his family from Metro South to a Precinct in Metro West Detroit. On his first day, Alex & his partner OFFICER ANN LEWIS (NANCY ALLEN) chase down an truck involved in an armed robbery at a bank, that just happens to be driven by a group of sadistic drug dealers. Tracing them to an abandon factory, Alex & Ann radio in for back-up but are told it cannot be sent, due to most of the units being tied up at the moment. They decide instead to head in themselves to apprehend the criminals, which proves to be a very big mistake, when Alex is brutally murdered by the drug dealers led by the cold hearted KURTWOOD SMITH. Morton immediately claims full ownership of Murphy's body, wiping Murphy's mind clean & then rebuilds his body with Armour & a computer in his head full of data & police commands & laws. Released to the public as \"RoboCop\" a well trained, well armed, half man, half machine, Murphy quickly rids the streets of the criminal scum who run it, while becoming a media sensation in the process. However he soon starts having flashbacks to his past & as a result, regains his full memory. Robocop then sets out to dispatch the violent felons who did him in. ROBOCOP has to be without a shadow of a doubt one of the best sci-fi action films ever made! it was so influential that it would spawn a whole catering of cyborg movies well into the 90's. The film is a refreshing (albeit violent) salty poke in the eye of the Regan-era sense ability prevalent at the time of it's release. It's loaded to the eyeballs with pitch black, droll humour featuring inane TV commercials (most of which promotes OCP products, video & board games). The film is insanely violent, as we see people thrown through plate glass windows, attempted rapes, a hand is blown off, bodies are literally shot almost to pieces with bullets, a body meltdown after a criminal has been dosed in toxic waste, various stabbings etc. Murphy's death in particular is one of the most violent ever committed to celluloid. The acting really works here, PETER WELLER was a good choice to play Robocop, while NANCY ALLEN stands out as Murphy's tough, but caring partner. KURTWOOD SMITH plays his villainous drug lord character to a hilt, while RONNY COX does well as the sadistic vice president of OCP, who attempts to destroy Robocop & re-install his own ED 209 robots. The direction by PAUL VERHOEVEN is perfection, as he is able to balance the action, science fiction & humour at a perfect balance & manages to capture all of the action set pieces at all the right angles. The only downside is, is that while the film is highly entertaining & it's plot really engaging & it's action set pieces tremendous, the film skimps on many other factors that I felt could have made the film that much better. For example we learn about a half hour in, that Murphy is a family man, with a loving wife & son & yet we never see Murphy with his family, we just catch glimpses of his past with them through a TV monitor, that Robocop has inside his memory bank. This plot point is incredibly watered down, so much so that it could so easily have been lifted from the film & we could still have a movie! A particular memorable (albeit sad sequence) sees Alex re-visitng his old home that he & his family moved into a few months prior when he re-located to this precinct, only to find the house empty & learning that his wife & kids have moved on. In fact, Murphy never meets his family again, who assume he's really dead & I felt this robbed the film of the emotional impact it could have had. All in all, ROBOCOP is highly recommended for all action fans, who want to see a nonstop in you're face action movie, you won't be disappointed! A box office smash that was quickly followed by a live action TV series in 1994, two animated children's series & a four part made for TV mini series called ROBOCOP: PRIME DIRECTIVES & a remake in 2014. Followed by two sequels, starting with ROBOCOP 2. **** stars" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "I was about 8 years old when I first saw RoboCop. Of course at that age I was much too young to be watching such a violent, grim movie but I loved every second of it. The breathless action, the dizzying pace and the surprising humour. As I got older, I began to realise the humour I'd picked up on was actually a very sly, cutting level of satire. RoboCop is not merely senseless violence (unlike some of director Paul Verhoeven's subsequent outings). It's a very carefully balanced blend of action with an astutely observed satirical view of the future that makes RoboCop a superior film of the genre. RoboCop is not too specific about how far into the future its set, but I assume the writers have placed it fairly close to our own time so its not too unrecognisable, but also distant enough with subtle changes in society to make it the near future. RoboCop is clever the way it draws the audience into this frighteningly realistic portrayal of our future. Instead of monologues or captions explaining what has happened to the world, the film quite ingeniously begins with a three minute news show headlining violent events underscored with a sharp wit, like neutron bombs used as a peace platform. Not to mention the hilarious adverts included that eat up the showtime, promoting everything from nuclear war boardgames for families to overpriced cars (6000 SUX!) with the slogan \"Bigger is Better. An American Tradition.\" The action is centred around the city of Old Detroit. Crime is rampant. Urban chaos is through the roof. And ever since OmniConsumer Products (OCP) took control of the police department, cop mortality rates have skyrocketed. Since OCP is nothing more than a faceless figurehead of heartless capitalism, they couldn't care less what happens to police precincts. So to remedy the crime in Old Detroit, Senior Vice President Dick Jones (Ronny Cox) has designed what he calls the future of law enforcement, ED 209. ED 209 is a giant cumbersome robot that is supposed to crack down on crime. But in one inspired scene, it is hilariously inept in everything it does. It makes mincemeat out of an executive after it unwaveringly follows its programming. And another exec comes up with a solution. Create a cyborg. Something that is programmed with police procedures, but tempered with the actual experience of being a cop. OCP get their chance when Officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) becomes a living shooting gallery at the hands of gangland hood Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith) and his cronies. OCP take what's left of Murphy, erase his memories, and turn him into RoboCop, a titanium armoured juggernaut, programmed with the desire to eliminate all crime. But when Murphy's human memories begin to surface, he tracks down Boddicker and his gang to get revenge. Including Jones, who's in league with Boddicker. If you look carefully behind all the bloodsoaked violence and shocking gore, you will find a very intelligent action film at the heart of RoboCop. It makes some very astute observations at the directions our society is headed. The idea that the police may strike because of the harsh conditions they're forced to endure is very frightening. As well as the notion that the youth of the future are being brainwashed by televised violence doesn't bode well either. Paul Verhoeven manages to get the focus just right in this film. He creates an extremely violent action film, but infuses it with a witty, satiric side that really enhances the viewing experience. I love the throwaway gags such as the urinals in the executive washrooms that have current interest rates above them. Verhoeven has never really managed to accomplish the same balance with his other SF films like Total Recall or Hollow Man. They have none of the intelligence of RoboCop. RoboCop's greatest asset was the inspired casting of Peter Weller. RoboCop is someone who has more than a passing resemblance to Judge Dredd. The top of his face is hidden, and we only see his jaw, and Weller manages to communicate an astonishing level of emotion. Consider the scene when he returns to his empty house after his wife and son have left. Memories of his previous life emerging briefly, and fading just as quickly. It demonstrates that Paul Verhoeven can infuse a tangible feeling of poignance when the need arises. Weller also does a superb job as RoboCop. With his monotone voice, stilted body language and lantern jaw, he gives a very realistic performance of a cyborg. On a par with Arnie's Terminator, Weller exudes authority, but also real sympathy for his situation. Which is not hard after we witness what happens to Murphy. A shockingly brutal demonstration of the callous disregard for life Boddicker's thugs have. Verhoeven keeps the action going but knows when to dial it down too. Something that doesn't always come easily to him. And its very gratifying watching Murphy whittle down the thugs who destroyed his life, eventually settling the score with Boddicker and Jones. The ending is bittersweet though. Murphy has reclaimed the humanity he was robbed of, but he can never go back to the way he was. And so it should be. There are no easy solutions here. Otherwise it would be a terrible ending to an exceptional action film. The sequels wavered in quality, but the original still holds the candle for being the most accomplished. An intelligent, witty, scathing action bonanza that still holds resonance today. Hard to believe it came from the director of Showgirls!" "I first saw this movie when I was three or four and was scared as hell! This movie is now quite possibly my favorite ever. There's a great blend of tragedy, deep storytelling, interesting shots, intense effects and insane action to satisfy anyone. There's (quite) a bit of blood so if you get sick easily avoid it. Everyone else must witness the awesome power of this sublime production. The effects are quite advanced. The stop motion ED-209 is mind-blowing. The Robocop suit is better than any CGI crap. I'll take props over green screen any day. This movie delivers intense action but also has a great, touching story about the loss of humanity. Peter Weller delivered a great performance, however uncomfortable he may have been. This movie has spawned two sequels, almost 100 comic books, toys and other random product (Robo Stationary), of which I have an interesting collection. Robocop is beyond cult status and I consider it to be an A movie, not a B movie. There are no real flaws in this movie but the action and the plot do slow down towards the end. However, the action does pick up. Robocop two is good, but not as amazing as the original. The end of the movie makes me smile every time I see it. This is truly a can't miss film for fans of sci-fi, action, satire or anyone looking for a cool movie." "It is Steven Spielberg Himself who encouraged Paul to come to the States to work on film making in and for Hollywood. Paul was not very interested at the beginning. When He first saw the script of Robocop, he thought it was rubbish. Sounds like a low budget B movie, maybe. But his wife didn't agree with this first impression and encouraged him to work on it. And the Dutch man did so. And provided one the best Action movie ever done. And trust me, I watched Lots of them! \"Robocop\" is very closed to perfection. Great casting, to begin with. From Murphy himself to Clarence Bodicker, one of the worst Villain ever portrayed. And everything is great in this movie. The Scenario is clever and realistic. The Editing also is terrific. There are no \"blank\" scenes whatsoever. It is action, action and action. Non stop with clever links. The music, the soundtrack, is also very efficient. This movie wont be as good if Paul didn't direct it. Paul got the power from Hollywood and he managed it very well!I love you Paul !" "A Great and totally originial Sci-Fi/Action treat! A movie of sheer excellence, and past all the blistering torcherous violence, there is a fantastic story in which some failed to see. Peter Weller gave a terrific zing to the character and I'm really wishing he stayed with the franchise, coulda provided some shred of hope for the catastrosphe which many fans of this film now know as Robocop 3. Nancy Allen was equally as breathtaking alongside the lead man, her care for Weller was portrayed so sincerely, it was nice to give Robocop a female opposite him, I felt more of stronger presence emotionally with Weller and Allen than I would with Glover and Gibson in Lethal Weapon for example. The villains were outstanding, I remember how much I hated Kurtwood Smith when I first saw this movie, meaning just how great of a villain he was, so empty, sadistic and menacing, a perfect portrayal. Ronny Cox did it for me as well. Paul Verhoeven's craftsmanship is masterful, it's also a shame he left the franchise I wished he had stayed for at least Robocop 2, he really gave this movie a feel that it's sequel lacked, that superior punch in the face of emotion combined with the intense violence, brilliance, one of my all time favourite movies and one of the first films that attracted me to cinema" "Add another review" "Find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your Watchlist and rate your favorite movies and TV shows on your phone or tablet!")("Movies, TV & Showtimes" "Celebs, Events & Photos" "News & Community" "Watchlist" "" "Find industry contacts & talent representation" "Manage your photos, credits, & more" "Showcase yourself on IMDb & Amazon" "Sign in with Facebook Other Sign in options" "Own the rights?" "I don't know why, but somehow this movie got to me more than any Sci Fi Action. Maybe its the cool story, maybe its the perfect storytelling, maybe its the futuristic drama we can find in some scattered places or maybe its the perfect acting from all the actors. Director Paul Verhoeven has directed the movie, and he is one of my personal all time favorite directors (alongside John Carpenter). He made more Sci Fi masterpieces, Total Recall and Starship Troopers, but this still is his greatest moment. Every single detail seems to be thought out completely and the direction is made with love. On his front, there are no negative parts. The acting is great, despite absence of those superstars like Tom Cruise and Mel Gibson. The movie proves that actors who are pretty unknown can make great performances. Peter Weller rocks the sh*t out of many actors with his spotless performance and so does almost every other actor. Maybe I haven't told you enough about the movie itself, but if you just start to look at it, you'll get hooked and after the movie you'll love it. Too bad that the two sequels qualify themselves to the bottom 100." "Major spoilers ahead. Dutch director Paul Verhoeven's \"Robocop\" is a masterful tale of a cybernetic human who has lost his humanity to the corporation that owns him, and his journey not only to exact vengeance on his murderers, but to regain his pre-mortem identity. This dystopian science fiction movie is quite unique because its vision of dystopia incorporates the perils of laissez-faire capitalism and the bloated conglomorates which have taken over peoples' lives. The nightmarish world of \"Robocop\" can be interpreted as an exaggeration of what Verhoeven saw as the problem with American capitalism, that private interests overcame the public good. The conglomerate portrayed in this movie cares little for public safety, even as it buys the decrepit police department of Old Detroit. Its officers, facing a losing battle against heavily-armed thugs and organized criminals, are merely nothing more than gears in the conglomerate's machine, and their lives are worth nothing unless they can turn a profit. So it is with Murphy, the protagonist, whose death proves portentous for one higher-up in the company, who uses the policeman's brain and corpse to power his pet project, \"Robocop.\" The inventor's rival also manufactures a tank-like war machine, intended for law enforcement, and sees Robocop as a threat. The latter company man, the evil Dick Jones, sees the threat as competition for his robot tank which, as he explains in the movie, even if it is a failure (at the expense of one company man's life), is valuable for its parts. Verhoeven's cynicism is extreme for his movie's vision of dystopia, as corporate capitalism colludes with organized crime for their own mutual interests rather than for the public good. The deceased Murphy has indeed lost his humanity, not only by becoming a robot, but also by being considered the corporation's property; he is not an individual, but a patented product. Robocop's assertion of individuality by exacting vengeance on his killers, and later against the corporation that sponsored them, is Verhoeven's allegoric demonstration of the individuals will to assert himself against those who see him as a mere cog in a machine, in this case a thing to be owned and to make profit for a corrupt capitalist oligarchy. Late-twentieth century news media---and the 1980s concerns of the Cold War, Latin American proxy wars, and the bourgeois culture of greed and consumption---are viciously and hilariously lampooned in a series of faux news broadcasts. It was wonderful of Verhoeven to include some delicious irony in his satire by casting Mary Hart, the bubbly blond co-host of \"Entertainment Tonight\" as a news anchor---one might argue that Hart, unknowingly or not, is caricaturing and parodying real life identity as a purveyor of superficial entertainment reporting. Those who sincerely believe in the capitalist ethos may be off-put by Verhoeven's extreme cynicism with the get-rich-quick way of life but it does bring a very interesting spin to the genre of science fiction which very few directors have been able to portray. The closest film which depicts this sort of dystopia is \"Blade Runner,\" also about consumer products asserting their individuality, but without the satiric bite of Verhoeven's masterpiece. Frank Weller is excellent as Robocop. The other actors all lend credibility to this marvelous film. It is filled with enough action and special effects to please any lover of action or science fiction movies. On important caveat is that this is an extremely violent movie. Verhoeven loves to be gruesome, and he dresses his violent flick to the nines. Do not let very small children watch this film. Other than that, I highly recommend this excellent science fiction classic." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Verhoeven has said that this movie,for him, is about the creation of an American Jesus. Being an American Jesus, therefore, Robocop shoots the bad guys to bring them to salvation. I must say, for years before I listened to Verhoeven's commentary for the film, I never understood this movie in that particular way. My understanding had been much more straightforward: a story about a man brought back from the dead to be used as a crime fighting machine, and, potentially, as a weapon of oppression by the power elites of OCP. That's Directive Four. It's also a horror movie about the forcible intrusion into the body of sharp, mechanical, hard edged things, against one's will. A horror story of a human identity trapped in an ugly mechanical shell. And just why is it that they keep Murphy's face? That always struck me as perverse, more of a designer's fancy than practical. I find the story, for all of its horror and cynical humor, to be uplifting: Murphy finds a way to exist in his new state of being, and regains an essential kind of humanity. He's still bound by his directives (that sinister Directive Four humming ominously away in his consciousness) but it's better than not knowing why he does what he does. Critics have been very unkind to the first sequel, Robocop 2. I find Robocop 2 to be just as brilliant, if not as tight and smooth as Verhoeven's original. Robocop 3 lost the thread for me, though it has one or two moments. Also of interest is Takashi Miike's own remix of Robocop, Full Metal Yakuza." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "What you normally expect from a 80s action film is big muscles, horrendous puns and oodles of homoeroticism. Instead RoboCop is an excellent satire with plenty of violence on the side. A pretty good combination, if I don't say so myself What's most worrying about watching RoboCop almost twenty years since it was released is how acutely the media portrayed in the film correlates with the media today. Hell, Media Break might as well just be called Fox News! Just take the glib, insincere way that Casey Wong says 'Get well, Frank.' It's just the same as some mindless cheerleader of a reporter whooping 'Marines kick ass!' Everything is reduced to inane soundbites. And then there's Corporate America. The film was made during the 'greed is good' era, but things haven't changed. It's still a macho, testosterone packed world where profits and personal advancement come first. After all, what matters more, that someone gets killed or that the 'glitch' that got the person killed costs the company $50m in interest payments? I think you know the answer. But there's also the references to Vietnam ('urban pacification' and McNamara), the state of American manufacturing (6000 SUX), privatisation, the American style of policing (reading someone their rights as you thrown them through a window) and religion (Verhoeven suggests that RoboCop is like Jesus. He gets crucified, he dies and he gets resurrected. And quite appropriately for an American Jesus, he kills a lot of people). So there's a lot there if you want to look for it However, just as an action spectacle the film more than delivers. The action sequences are universally superb. The best one of all is probably the drug factory shoot-out. The music is great, the shots are superbly picked and there's none of that schizophrenic editing that you get in modern action films. Here you can actually see what's happening! Another great piece of action is the gas station explosion. Ah, the age without CGI But the action would be empty if you didn't care about the hero. Thankfully, though, you doeven when he's a tin can! I mean, Murphy must have one of the most grisly deaths on celluloid. He's blown to bits, taunted ('Does it hurt?') and then ruthlessly executed. If you didn't care for him before, you do afterwards. And when he becomes RoboCop, he still manages to elicit more sympathy than most action heroes. Most of this is probably because he's so obviously flawed. Sure he's a ruthless killing machine but he's been stripped of his identity, his family and even his body ('lose the arm'). So when he revisits his house and sees what he lost and when like Frankenstein he sees his reflection and when he's hunted down by his own colleagues; you can't help but feel for him. I also have to admit that I can't help but feel sorry for Bob when he's killed. He's a slimy scumbag, yeah, but anyone who lives the American Dream by doing cocaine with bimbos can't be all bad. And I also have say that his death scene has one of the best lines in film history: 'Bitches leave.' Clarence Boddicker is such a charmer. And that's another thing that makes the film so enjoyable; it's main villain. Clarence Boddicker is exactly what you want every movie villain to be: irredeemably evil. He even kills his own men. You don't get much better than that Perhaps the only bad thing about RoboCop is ED-209. But even that's good. I'll never tire of him mowing down a hapless junior executive (I love the way that his colleagues push him out of the way. Gordon Gekko would be proud). In fact, RoboCop makes me pine for an era free from CGI, where fascist violence was liberal and where there was lots of good old-fashioned cussing. What's happened to mainstream cinema these days? Surely with George W.Bush in charge, political successor to Ronald Reagan as he is, the streets of Hollywood should be flowing with blood by now" "When people hear the words Robocop they often make the mistake of categorising it as yet another sci/fi action movie like the Terminator. Robocop is so much more then that. Robocop is a message, a warning about the dangers of unchecked capitalist ambition and greed. Robocop took the negative aspects of 80's cut-throat society and placed them into a futuristic environment. As such Robocop must be treated with a special reverence amongst films, this is not simply another film but rather a work of genius that allows all those who watch the film to gain an understanding of 1980's society. Robocop is indeed a philosophical masterpiece. The Suffering of Alex Murphy/Robocop is perhaps best comparable to the saviour myth of many religions including Christianity. Robocop is the great Irony whilst he personifies moral corruption it is he who will save Human Society from self destruction. As a film Robocop has it all, a great Plot backed up by Great Characters. Notably Clarence Boddicker the films villain. Hde is perhaps one of the most believable and effective screen villains of all time. The great story and characters are backed up by premium effects and high paced action. In conclusion Robocop is a life changing film that you will want to watch again and again." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Along with the Terminator this was the best scifi action film to come out during the 1980's. Though Peter Weller didn't become a household name, he does an excellent job as a murdered police officer, who is resurrected as a type of cyborg programmed to fight crime. As \"Robocop\" he dispenses justice with computer controlled pinpoint shooting accuracy. There is a lot of camp (some of it is extremely funny) which does nothing to diminish the serious drama of the film. Nancy Allen does a good job as Robocop's partner and look for the guy from That 70's Show as the evil villain." "Truly science fiction action-film at its perfection. Director Paul Verhoven (of Total Recall) paints a distopic view of future Detroit, a crime-ridden city where cops are threatening to go on strike. A large corporation that practically runs the United States Military comes out with a new machine: Robocop. This film explores the hauntingly Frankenstein-esque life of a man who has died and been transformed into a machine, or rather, super-human. The film asks questions, like what does it mean to be human? We explore the human side of robocop, as he uncovers his mysterious past. He finally gets to confront, and possibly get revenge on his killers. The film also challenges ideas of growing corporate control, as shown by the corrupt nature of OCP, a corporate entity who becomes \"above the law.\" It explores the city, a corrupt city much like an American version of of Moscow, where criminals have infiltrated the highest levels of corporate power. The distopic city has been so neglected that there is a \"New Detroit\" or \"Delta City\" where there can be hope, the rich can live in, and be away from the unsavable crime of \"old detroit.\" Although the film was made in the 80's, it is definitely still watchable today. It has much violence and gore, and is quite realistic in its special effects which are mostly animatronic. The special effects still live up to this day, and give the film a certain \"edge.\" In addition, this film challenges certain notions about corporate control of the military, and how the military-manufacturing industry, when out of control, can become dangerous to the common man and common society. It is an important watch in the strange world we are seeing develop in the United States. With such great questions & futuristic action, this film wins in both the action & science fiction category, and is easily one of the most perfect marriages of the two genres. It even has good acting, which can be rare for both of these genres. 10/10!!! (rare)" "Robocop is a film that almost didn't get made. Most people loved the concept, but hated everything else, especially the title. Some say this film is about violence and it is violent. (30 people are killed in the film according to this site)The film has to be violent to get the point across that something like Robocop is necessary, but the film is not about violence. It is more then a bloody action film. Paul Verhoven has stated that he intended this film to be more about death and resurrection then anything else. To state the idea that the sort of everyman that the character of Alex Murphy embodies could overcome death to rise again. Only to find that it is not worth the trip. Although that is felt throughout the whole film, deeper than that is what Edward Neumeier said he wanted to make the film about. What would life be like if Reaganomics had kept going? What if the yuppie population had continued to grow? What if the whole world became populated by guys like Dick Jones? (played so superbly by Ronny Cox that it is hard to tell where Cox ends and Jones begins) Alex Murphy lives in a world just like that. In a world where mans unchecked greed is finally starting to consume him. In Murphy's world there are no people, there are only consumers. Those who cannot afford to consume, become themselves consumables and are consumed. O.C.P could be any number of corporations. It is a symbol of everything that is wrong with our country. It is accumulated wealth and power, it is the big unfeeling beast that devours everything in it's path, including our friend Alex Murphy. They do not rob Murphy of his life, but of his death. They remove his dignity and strip him down to nothing more then another product, but Murphy fights back. Murphy retains something more than the memories they took from him, he retains the feelings of being human and becomes more than a machine with a human face, more then just Robocop the product. Peter Weller gives him that face and that emotion. Even behind the face shield on the helmet that Weller wears thought most of the film we can still feel his pain. We can see the hurt in his eyes, even though his eyes our covered. Alex Murphy is as Verhoven has stated a futuristic Christ. He bears the weight of our greed and the sin of or lust for wealth. We can see ourselves as the victimized Alex Murphy and we can wonder how much it would take for us to become the victimizing Dick Jones." "Many people give lame reviews for Robocop but I found it a very entertaining and in-your-face movie. The acting was, actually, pretty good and the story was deep. One thing that drew me to this movie was its raw humor. Parts of the film are so cheesy that it adds to the film's laughs and makes it more unique. Robocop himself is a great design and one of the better Sci-Fi characters in recent history. Peter Weller plays Robocop in his one truly famous role. The Musical Score is terrific and you will find your self humming it after the film's end. The film is surprisingly bloody, but in a good way. Robocop is a very violent revenge story(Rated R) and the action is first class for an 80's movie. The film is funny and creative, the bad guys are cool, and Weller's voice is a perfect human and machine fusion. I fully recommend Robocop for anyone(who doesn't mind blood)with an open mind seeking something different and fun." "A classic should be something that time does little about its grandeur. Well that happens here. There's no over-extended scenes or unnecessary dialogue, yet, the characters' construction is superb. It's a basically a 'futuristic urban story'; but still is full of ironies about corporative-controlled institutions, media and the place of individual beings in a collapsed society, things that affect us today. Michael Miner and Edward Neumeir's script is very influenced by comic-books and their particular ways of narrative, and it was a great update of a sci-fi classic theme (robotics) for a whole generation. Needless to say that the 'Primal Directives' of Robo are very similar to the 'Three Laws of Robotic' of Isaac Asimov. Paul Verhoeven is one of the greatest directors in history. RoboCop established him as a strong name in Hollywood and gained him lots of fans and even the respect of some intellectual critics always fond on destroying films like this one. The performance of the cast is subtle, but convincing. The most impressive performance is given by the whole cast not by a particular actor or actress. The bloodshed actually works fine showing how Detroit will be: lethal and unsafe. Everyone could be shredded in the streets of the post-urban Detroit. The combination of good actors, agile montage, non-static cameras, great FX and a beautiful score, made a masterpiece that should be used as an example in Cinema's Schools. If you never paid attention to the score composed by Basil Poledouris, it is a shame. It's worth owning given its elegant, grand and constant changing tunes. It fits just fine with every piece of celluloid is accompanying. All kinds of emotions can be unleashed upon hearing it: sadness, melancholy, triumph, tension; very original classical inspired music."

"This classic piece of cinematic art was helmed by dutch uber director Paul Verhoeven. It is kind of a humanoid terminator and whereas most would think that Robocop is but another robo action-flick,- most would be dead wrong. This is actually a robo actionflick with soul and the kind of themes that usually features in Verhoeven films. Instead of a hard-ass hero, we see that Robocop is actually a tragic hero who is de-humanised by the technology that saved his life. This movie is a visual feast and was way ahead of its time...having said that, it kicks serious ass even in modern day standards. And with all the versus movies doing the rounds...AvP FvJ, I half expect Robocop VsTerminator in the not too distant future." "When i first saw the 1st Robocop, i was about 6 years old and my mum had edited out all the graphically violent parts. Then i saw the original version with the violence when i was about 10. And now i have just recently purchased the special edition DVD and it has the full uncut version and oh my god it is brilliant. It has extra gore on the ED 209 sequence towards the beginning, during the mutilation of poor old Murphy and at the end where the main bad guy dies, i wont go into details about the changes, but i will say one thing, this makes it the most violent films ever to hit the DVD shelves. The film itself still contains all the original parts to it and still holds up as one of the greatest movies of the 20th century. Pure 100% adrenaline fueled mayhem combined with a dark look at a possible future to be." "At least in my mind, he takes a script that probably shouldn't have worked when you think about it. A man behind a machine in the 80's? Preposterous, but Verhoven pulls it off with a big hand from Peter Weller in the character of Murphy/Robo. If you're not a big fan of gore this probably isn't for you, Verhoven mentions in the DVD commentary of the directors cut (at least in Australia) that \"You couldn't have the resurrection without the crucifixtion\" and indeed Murphy's death is one of the most brutal scenes I've ever seen, especially in the directors cut as Murphy gets blown away by a group of thugs who knew they had him right where they want him before he's whisked away to the hospital and a seeming death, fade to black. The End. Or so you think, I kinda agree with Verhoven when he says he wanted 10-15 seconds of black before the movie. That would've worked well. Anyway we return with Murphy as Robocop, the new cyborg police machine who immediately makes an impact on the streets of Detroit, but the man behind the machine begins getting flashbacks of his life as Murphy and soon looks to take revenge. I should mention the marvellous performance by Kurtwood Smith in the role of Bodicker, one of the great villians but his role is somewhat underrated. Later on we find that Bodicker is working for OCP but when Robo tries to attack the OCP head we finally learn of \"Directive 4\" Never harm an OCP employee, which all leads to the shootout finale as Bodicker and his toughs try to terminate Robo like they did Murphy. It also features one of the more innovative ways to kill a mega-villian. The movie ends with Robo confronting OCP with the evidence of ED-209s creators collusion and again a simple solution sees him reach his end. Then just like that end of movie. Robocop probably was a few years before it's time and thus isn't as fondly remembered as some films but it's one of the best action movies out there today and fans of that genre won't be dissapointed picking this one up. Everyone was on song in this movie. From the director to the actors to the special effects guy to the guy that got everyone's coffee. Everyone put 110% into their roles and took what on paper may have been an average screenplay and made it a great one. I give it **** or 8/10" "Paul Verhoeven is a master of the futile and messy death, and nowhere does he show this off to better effect than Robocop. The titular character is almost totally covered in impenetrable armour, so when he walks into a gunfight, he cannot be hurt, but the stage can be set for an fetishtically long sequence where countless hoodlums are written off with a single shot while blazing away uselessly. The titular character's nemesis is a walking tank that orders suspects to throw away their guns or be shot, but then malfunctions and shoots them anyway. You can see from this the sort of sense of humour Paul Verhoeven has. And this isn't even the worst the movie has to offer. The goal here is the same as Starship Troopers: take a simple leftist idea like the safeguarding of individual rights or opposition to unrestricted capitalism or militarism, and dress it up with so much violence that the political dimension will be the last thing on anyone's mind. Stupid, conservative, politically-correct North America thus misses the forest for the trees. Sorry, I haven't mentioned the actual movie itself yet. It's good stuff. It shows its 80s roots strongly, but not in a bad way. Upper management having a cocaine party, for example, or \"the orbiting SDI platform misfiring and killing two former US presidents!!!\" Take that Reagan! Oh, sorry, there's the political edge again." "When I first saw Robocop I must have been about nine or ten years old: my mum was at work and my dad had sneaked out to a mates house in order to smuggle me the forbidden film. I had heard about it from a mate at school and was desperate to see it. Within the first few minutes I was enthralled. I was totally convinced I was watching an accurate portrayal of the future - it is gritty, yet authentic. The most impactual element for me - back then - was the extreme nature of the violence, and therin lies the main problem people have with the text. Yes, as a ten year old, the blood and gore is the main attraction - but Robocop is a film which rises above the box office draw reasons to create a multilayered and meaningful film. The notions of corporate power are explicitly unmdermined as inherantly corrupt in the ruthless characterisations of Dick Jones et el. The police are portrayed as humans with faults - unusual for a film whose principle charcter is a cyborg hero. And of course the lead role is a perfect vehicle for an examination of what REALLY makes us 'human'. The inclusion of the way the American media sanitises shocking events and turns them into entertainment, or even something to sell, is especially relevent today. The special armour effects by Rob Bottin are second to none, the stop motion - although dated - fits perfectly with the style of the film and does not stand out as a bad thing, and Verhoven pulls all of the punches on the witty dialogue and visceral violence. Weller shines in the role of Murphy and Clarence Boddicker is a suitably soddish villain. Many people feel that the storytlene mirrors that of Christ - its certainly about retributional violence and Murphy is an almost Christ-like figure (at least in his progression) so maybe there is some weight to the argument. Don't worry about that til the film's over though! Highlights include an arrest at an attempted rape, the toxic waste sequence and Clarence being \"deep-throated\" by Robo's spike!" "Peter Weller plays Alex Murphy, a good cop who is killed in the line of duty by a ruthless gang of villians led by the very excellent Kurtwood Smith. His dead body is then used in an experiment to create the perfect law enforcer...Robocop. All goes well until Robocop starts remembering his previous life and tries to piece together Murphys past which leads him to discover the events leading up to Murphy's death. This film could have been ruined had it not been for the excellent script, great special effects, brilliant performances by the cast including Ronny Cox as the villanous Dick Jones and not forgetting Peter Weller in the title role. Check out Nancy Allen in what some have said is the best role of her career. Dutch director Paul Verhoeven throws in some excellent satire with adverts like Nuke-Em which appears after a news report on the threat of nuclear confrontation. Not forgetting the news reports themselves which feature some excellent Irony \"Top story, the Star Wars orbitting Peace Platform misfired today, three ex president's are amongst the dead.\" Every base is covered in this film and we feel empathy for Murphy's character throughout. It's amazing to think that this film cost a third of what Robocop 2 cost to make but is far superior than the two sequels and the tv series's put together. It's just shows that money is not everything when it comes to making one of the greatest Sci-Fi Action films of all time. Imagination, character development, good story and great script is. I cannot go without mentioning the excellent stop motion scenes involving ED-209. This was before CGI but the effect is superb. If you haven't already seen this film then you must.....Must...MUST. THAT IS THE LAW......Thank you for your co-operation." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "SPOILERS Ok, 1987, Paul Verhoeven directed and released his finest work. That piece of movie history was \"Robocop\", and compared with all his other works, it is still miles ahead in terms of quality. In this movie we are introduced to Peter Weller's Alex J Murphy. Murphy is a new transfer to possibly the worst police station in Detroit. In this near future where everything looks advanced, despite still being scarily 1980s, humanity has become even more capitalistic and crime is at an alltime high. Murphy goes out on patrol with his new partner Officer Anne Lewis, played with a grating irritation by Nancy Allen, and on their first outing is butchered by a group of men lead by the evil Clarence Boddicker. Out of pure coincidence however, at this time the corporate company who runs the police force is experimenting with cyborg policemen and using Murphy's body, they create the future of Law Enforcement, the title character, the Robocop. Murphy's resurrected being goes out into the world to fight crime, stop his murderers, and rediscover himself. Let's just say straight away that this movie is great. The special effects for the time they were based are impressive and the direction by Verhoeven, who planned for this to be a modern retelling of the story of Jesus Christ, is equally amazing. It's hard to know what to say next about this movie really. All the acting, with the exception of the infuriating Allen, is relatively straight forward and nothing too special, but then it was never meant to be anything breathtaking. Ultimately this film is about the action and the question of what it is to be human. Verhoeven does attempt to answer all his philosophical questions, and what he does is impressive, ultimately though, it's as a violence filled movie which this piece will be remembered best as. Put your feet up, press play on your video or dvd player, and enjoy once the finest movies of the 1980s." "When Robocop was released in 1987 it was fresh and original. Nothing had been done exactly like this before and it shows. The actual feel of the movie was amazing and still is. At times violent and brutal but totally enjoyable at the same time. ED-209 looked and moved great (hah! who needs CGI!) and the excellent famous line \"I bet you think you're pretty smart huh? Think you can outsmart a bullet?\" (which was sampled for a couple of top hip-hop and rave tunes) is just one good example of how clever some of the quotes are in this film . The weapons are awesome and a lot of skill went in to making this movie. It could so easily have sucked like Robocop 3 but this movie was in the right hands. The eighties was such a great decade for movie making that if Robocop had been made now it would most likely suck as it would be made less violent for the mainstream viewer even if the effects would be technically superior. Miss this gem at your peril! 10/10" "RoboCop is a classic satirical science fiction film that is probably too violent (and sex saturated) for young children, and a little comicy for thinking adults--which makes it perfect for that money-spending mass we call teens. Plot Synopsis: In near-future Detroid suffering from uncontrolled crime, a young policeman gets shot trying to stop a vicious criminal--and his body is used to make a prototype android-policeman--a cop that never tires, always shoots 100% accurate and has cool shiny protective metal body, and even delivers sarcastic oneliners. But just when RoboCop becomes media sensation and a hope of ridding the city of crime, he faces evil both from the criminal element and the corruption within the Police. The movie is strong on the art direction/ production design--from RoboCop's catchy appearance, to the crime-ridden, decaying Detroid in the near-futuristic America, where Police is privatized. The most memorable sequences is when the aryan looking cop gets resurrected via becoming RoboCop--we do not see how RoboCop looks, as he walks and we see everything through his digitized POV...yet we catch a quick glance of his head in a monitor (or was it a mirror?). And by now everyone knows the film is a satire on the over-the-top media use in U.S. etc. The score is also memorable and heroic-themed. the script is pretty tight, and makes the film roll fast. With the exception of one unnecessary gory sequence in the end, in which a criminal gets acidized and becomes something like a liquid melting chunk of flesh (AND he gets hit by a van), this movie is great, though its atmosphere, if you forget the humour, can seem a little chilly and alienated--which is fitting enough for a movie about an android cop. **** Vlad" "A new Detroit cop is slayed by a band of violent criminals and is chosen to be the test subject of a new cyborg cop program called \"Robocop\". Things start out great, if the criminal body count can be described as great, but Robocop begins to regain his memory. He sets out to find out who he was, and when he does begins a hunt to get back at the criminals who slayed him. fueled by violent, pulsating action, Robocop will give action fans about all of what they look for in an action movie. the film is quite violent though, the criterion DVD is suppose to be much more violent. The ED 209 cyborg is amazing. ***/4" "Add another review" "Find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your Watchlist and rate your favorite movies and TV shows on your phone or tablet!")("Movies, TV & Showtimes" "Celebs, Events & Photos" "News & Community" "Watchlist" "" "Find industry contacts & talent representation" "Manage your photos, credits, & more" "Showcase yourself on IMDb & Amazon" "Sign in with Facebook Other Sign in options" "Own the rights?" "This movie is full of symbolism, social commentary and political satire, it is worth watching more than once. It is far more than a typical action movie and is in the same league as other classics like Highlander, The Road Warrior, Aliens and Terminator (1 & 2). I won't go into detail about the plot because if you are the type of person who enjoyed the above mentioned movies you should run, don't walk, to your nearest DVD store and buy it immediately. This film is so well written and directed that it could be used in a film school to show students how it should be done. Yes the acting is over the top, yes it is extremely violent, and yes the story seems outlandish but this is a real diamond-in-the-rough. If you don't agree then you just don't get it and never will, you're not a sci-fi fan and think this is just another action movie. If you do agree, you probably already own it and have seen it at least three times. Far superior the the sequel which is still worth watching but pales in comparison to the original. If you haven't seen it in a while, watch it again... and pay attention to the details." "A huge hit when it was released in 1987, Robocop was a great action movie and a lot smarter than its maybe given credit for. It spawned a classic arcade game and many a bedroom wall had a Robocop poster on it. Its up there with the The Terminator, Rambo, Aliens and Predator as one of the definitive action films of the 80's. Of course they soiled its reputation by two awful follow ups Robocop 2 and Robocop 3 which even original star Peter Weller passed on. As ever the original is best and is well worth buying on DVD as long you don't buy it with the other two films." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Won't worry about spoilers, cause this is not really a whodunnit. Robocop remains one of the high points of Hollywood movies in the late eighties. Who let Paul Verhoeven direct it? They probably regretted it a thousand times through production, but no-one else could have taken such a ridiculous script and made it into such an admirable movie. Watch it for the satire on modern american society and Reaganism (striking, privately owned cops?). Sure, some of the effects are a little ropey now, but Weller's stand-out physical performance is one of the best mimes ever to make it onto film. I genuinely think he deserved at least an oscar nomination for this. It's so easy to forget that he isn't really a robot. With a strong stomach necessary, this is unmissable." "Police officer is killed and rebuilt as a cyborg, goes gunning for the lowlives that killed him. Sounds like a real silly movie, doesn't it? It should and that is how the sequels and all other movies trying to imitate this movie come off. In this case, Paul Verhoeven weaves a tale that can entertain both the thinker and the action fan. I've seen a documentary where Peter Weller said that he wished the violence that was cut out to make the 'R' rating was left in. He felt it made the film more funnier. I beg to differ. With one exception, the violence was cartoonish enough that anymore would've bogged it down and the exception had to be that way. One of the best things of the movie is that Ronny Cox, Kurtwood Smith and Paul McCrane play some of moviedom's most vilest and memorable of villains. Up to that point, one usually found these three playing some of the more sensitive characters. And they pull it off! Chock full of quotable lines and seemingly throw-a-way parts that come back to mean something later, this movie is a lot of fun." "The story of a cop who is killed and brought back to life as a cyborg by a major company called OCP corporations, Robocop has a little bit of everything a person could want in a movie. It keeps you guessing, The reactions of Weller's Robocop are astounding and emotional. Most people laugh when I recommend Robocop. They think it's terrible. Most of the blame can be placed on Robocop 3, the movie which made people shudder at the sight or thought of Robocop on the Silver/small screen, and thus, Robocop fans suffer: Unable to see a decent new project or sequel by the original team. Verhoeven's direction in Robocop is some of his finest, and Peter Weller is honestly the only person suited to play the character in my opinion. He has the voice, the image, the structure both physically and in his acting. Nancy Allen shines as does Kurtwood Smith and all the supporting cast. The movie is truly one of the best films ever made, offering action, romance, suspense, drama, science fiction, horror (or gore if you want to call it that), as well as great acting, directing, and script writing. This franchise was one of the most poorly exploited, and it's a damn shame too. Highly, Highly recommended." "RoboCop is interesting on various levels for various reasons. In the first three minutes alone we are exposed to a total parody of everything we see on TV--health advertisements claiming compassion and long life, civil dispute, and global conflict all viewed from the safety of your own home (\"It's OK, he saw it on the TV\"). Everything from the obvious business corruption and defective merchandise (\"I'm sure it's only a glitch.\") to architecture and even music. Paul Verhoeven hit his highest mark as a director with this movie. It is not empty-headed like Starship Troopers and doesn't have a dependency on violence like Total Recall. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Total Recall has one violent act every seven minutes, minimum. Whereas in Total Recall, the carnage is merely titillation for action fans, RoboCop has a hidden moral to its message. The pacing is terrific, even though the DoP must have been loafing during production. RoboCop also infuses the original Frankenstein story in an amazing way. Peter Weller's character is frightening yet awesome. He is human and machine with the traits of both, but what happens when one starts becoming dominant? What happens when he starts having emotions? The rest of the cast (except Kurtwood Smith) are comic book in nature. Smith as Clarence Boddicker is the only one who manages to draw more than the typical 2D response because of his nagging charisma. He may not be talented, but here his ability is displayed in whatever glory it can attain. Overall, I found this movie more than satisfying, but weak-stomached individuals (who have no grasp of the real world) will detest its level of brutality. 4.5 out of 5 stars." "I recently bought the 3DVD Box containing all the Robocop movies. Part 2 and 3 aren't really worth mentioning after having seen the original. Robocop's a pure classic with lots of black humour, a very appealing (though tragic) \"hero\" and the real fierce and mean baddie Clarence Boddicker. Ah yes, there also is alot of gunfire, blood, gore and most above all a real message this movie delivers. Find out for yourselves (if there's still anybody that hasn't seen it). Definitely one of the best Sci-Fi/Action movies ever made. Highly Entertaining!! 10/10" "A brilliant sci-fi parody, very underrated modern action film! Paul Verhoevens directing is superlative with great acting and one of the screens best vilians Clarence Bod icker. Should be on everyones top ten sci-fi lists!!!" "One of the most emotional action film you will ever see. Peter Weller portrays police officer Alex Murphy brutually murdered in one of the most violent scenes you are ever likely to see ( especially in the director's cut), and then brought back from the dead as Robocop. The only problem being that Robocop figures out who he really is and sets out to bring his own killers to justice. What sets Robocop apart is our genuine care for the hero. We really want him to win at the end. Weller truly portrays Robocop's humanity really well and quite touchingly. Whilst Kurtwood Smith plays one of the most hated villians I can recall. A real psycho who you cannot wait to see suffer at the hands of the man he killed . Add a great score to the mix and you have a really good movie. Be warned though , despite the fact that is told in a real comic book sense, it is far from a kid's movie. As a matter of fact it is one of the most violent movies I have ever scene." "The one thing I loved about this movie was how good the story was and how original it is. Some would think that it is a Terminator rip off but its far from it. In fact there are a few movie that sole idea's from this one. The whole thing with the perfect fighting machine made from scraps of a dead human was used again in Universal Soldier. And the idea of the soldiers having their bad memories come back and make them rebel is straight from Robocop. This is one of the many original idea's from this movie. Peter Weller was good as Robocop, but I think that Kurtwood Smith stole the show as the creepy bad guy Clarence Boddiker. The rest of the cast is good, and all in all this is one hell of a movie."

"This film has a lot of great things going for it. The directing is awesome, the story is very cool and quite interesting, the acting is top-notch, the action is non-stop, the comedy is well done and well placed, the make-up effects are incredible and the special effects are phenomenal! Paul Verhoeven is a very predictable director, but does a very good job and knows how to do things right! I say he's predictable because there are certain things that he loves to have in his films (i.e. strong violence and graphic scenes), but that isn't necessarily a bad thing, you just have to expect it when seeing his films. I think \"Robocop\" is my favorite Paul Verhoeven film to date (\"Total Recall\" being a close second). Everything in this film is done so well. Robocop is very well done and has a VERY impressive look to him. Not only Robocop, but ED-209 as well, WHAT AN AWESOME DESIGN!!! Peter Weller's portrayal of Robocop is superb as well. Peter does an excellent job of making robotic movements and his voice is very true to character. The rest of the cast was quite good as well, Nancy Allen, Ronny Cox, Kurtwood Smith and Miguel Ferrer deserve some extra notice. If you are a fan of science fiction / action films, then I strongly suggest you see this film! I can watch this film over and over and not get tired of it, it's just that good. I truly hope that you enjoy the film as much as I do. Thanks for reading, -Chris" "This film could have been a simple action flick, but it avoids that completely by having an intelligent plot, interesting lead character, and incredibly on-target satire of late 1980s trends. Although very violent, I can't really say it is gratuitious since the violence always serves the plot. A must-see, I rate it at 9." "A (very violent and) well-assembled action/science fiction thriller that's set in Detroit in the future where a corporate executive takes the remains of a cop, Murphy (Peter Weller) who was brutally murdered in the line of duty and turns him into RoboCop, a cyborg cop who has the marksmanship of Dirty Harry, the heart like Serpico, and the mind of his own. In return, the rebuilt cop goes after the thugs led by Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith) who literally left him for dead, riddled with gun shots and anyone who has ties with them. The film was directed by Paul Verhoeven, who became well-known for his early efforts like \"The Fourth Man\", and unfortunately, for \"Showgirls\" in the mid-nineties. What Verhoeven gives here isn't your typical thriller, it's one that has humor, courage, and most important, heart. Perhaps, the best moment in the movie is when the Weller character tells his concerned partner, Lewis (Nancy Allen) \"You may not like what you're about to see.\" and we see why. This movie also boasts an excellent musical score composed by Basil Poledouris and the special effects/make-up done by Rob Bottin add another benefit to the film." "Robocop is a great film. I had seen it many times when I was a kid, before I even fully understood and appreciated what films actually were. I believe Robocop has a bad reputation as a serious film because it was released at the time of so many other action and sci-fi films around at the time, and it seemed to be a contest as to who could outdo each other in the over the top stakes. The film has lasted so well for so long because it is a great story with a great concept. Just like in Blade Runner, the world that the film takes place in doesn't look so different as it is now, even though it is set sometime soon in the future. And it's certainly not impossible to imagine it couldn't turn out like Old Detroit. The film has also had an infamous reputation because of the violence. The film IS incredibly violent, especially in the unrated version, and for my money is the most so I've seen in American cinema. Murphy's death scene is pretty savage and seems to last forever if it's the first time you've seen it. It's also nicely paralleled with Robocop being gunned down by Lieutenant Hedgecock later on outside the OCP building, Hedgecock and Boddicker both working for Dick Jones. And poor Kinney, who gets shot to tatters by ED-209. The film also touches on other themes such as large multi-conglomerate corporations privatising public services and news broadcasts which relay constantly shocking news daily and perfectly delivered by their smiling anchor's, which seems more and more relevant each year. The score is surprisingly memorable and fits in very nicely whenever Robo is onscreen. For me this is Paul Verhoven's best film, and he never really got as close to something as good as this again, though he almost came close a few times." "I have been mostly rating the content of the movies, and not telling much about the story. This movie is hands down one of the best sci-fi movies around. I am the proud owner of the Criterion Collection director's cut. If you like this movie, this version is THE version to own. The director's cut contains what I feel is two of the greatest maimings ever filmed. You will know them when you see them. Rated R: strong bloody violence, language, and brief nudity. Unrated: intense graphic violence and gore, language, and brief nudity." "This is one of the most violent movies ever. My parents wouldn't let me rent it (I was 8 at the time) so I first saw it at a friends house. Seeing it again, after many years, I found this movie to be very entertaining. The effects are still quite amazing and I've always had a thing for robots. Highly thought provoking and cynical. And the musical accompaniment by Basil Pouledouris is amazing. 8/10" "Robocop was not only the first of Paul's movies I viewed, but also, by far the best. His infusion of the media with character development was fresh and innovative. He has continued to incorporate it within the frame work of his films, but none so poetically. If the majority of scifi movies were half as clever as this one; THERE WOULD BE TROUBLE. Beware. This movie is not for children; even though I saw it as a child and it seemed to be targeting the youth. Nothing like packaging ultraviolence for the kiddies. Ironic, but true. Many shots were attempted at expanding the original idea with as much success as an anorexic in a chocolate factory. At least the original exploited the stupidity of our love affair for violence; what followed just exploited our own tolerance for stupidity." "I see RoboCop as one of the truly great sci-fi films--a mix of cool technology, a dystopian future, a basic hero myth, and a thought-provoking commentary. Some people see The Terminator and RoboCop as two sides of the same coin; I'd say RoboCop is the mechanical monster movie with more of a satirical bent--and that's all to the credit of the smart script. Buried beneath Verhoeven's more-is-more filmmaking philosophy are simultaneous man vs. self and man vs. machine battles--but beneath THAT is a scathing social commentary on a future filled with media overexposure and consumerist overload. What a shame the limp sequels ditched the very premise (Man or machine? Human or product? If you take a brain out of the person, can you take the person out of the brain? Or, uh, something like that) that make RoboCop such a genre standout." "I've seen this film numerous times now and still it entertains me a lot. I really must say that Paul Verhoeven knows what he does (most of the time, for I haven't seen Showgirls (yet) and I thought The Hollow Man was not too good). But this really is a good, action film, which I must say has some pretty brutal scenes and that of course is one of the two things (brutality and a lot of skin) Verhoeven is notorious of and I must say I am not offended by it, I like it. It resembles how sick our society is. But this film does not only show us where we are, but also where we might be going. I mean look at those news broadcasts in the film. The newsreaders are barely (if at all) affected by what they tell us and the way the catastrophe's (cause it all is bad news) are cut in a way that is totally mechanic, without emotions of any kind. They go even further, they just throw in commercials in the middle of the news and not just any kind, commercials of the worst kind. Enough about what I think this movie is about and on to the stuff you care about. This movie is really good. I mean OK, some of the effects are not first class, but other things are. The story is good. The acting is good (except for Kurtwood Smith, who is a GOD as the ultimate mean motherfu..er), there are a few laughs (if you are sarcastic like me and the bad guys) plus there is a lot of action and brutality. Just about everything you need in a good movie. I know I do not say this often, but this really is a film for 16+ I think. 8 out of 10" "One of the best sci-fi movies on the 80's, chock full of political commentary, social and corporate mockery of Reagan-era society, and let's not forget a tough cyborg out for justice. ROBOCOP is the story of a murdered police officer who is \"resurrected\" throrugh the miracles of technology in the near future. Given a bullet-proof exoskeleton, he busts crime and heads in futuristic Detroit. However he soon finds out that he is not just a threat to criminals, but some of his superiors as well. Peter Weller is perfect as the part man, part machine crimefighter, and both Ronny Cox and Miguel Ferrier soar as dualing corporate execs Dick Jones and Bobby Morton vying for the coveted \"teacher's pet\" position with their company's CEO. But it's Kurtwood Smith's performance as Clarence Boddicker, the slick-as-ice gang leader who really steals the show. This film has a lot in common with HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER, and a good atmosphere to accompany it. It's also violent as hell, and is notorious for having extensive cuts to a few scenes. I still crank up the TV during the cocaine factory shootout, so I can get the full feel of the movie's fanfare mixed with Sam Peckinpah-inspired quick cuts of violence. Excellent scene! This is director Paul Verhoeven's best American film, and a great all around movie. The best thing about this film is the story, concerning a cyborg who wants to stay human, and if he can't be, he feels he owes his human half the justice he deserves. 9 stars. If you can stomach the gore and violence while focusing on the story, then you'll see why this is an awesome sci-fi action flick: wicked comic bookish style mixed with biting social commentary. A must for any action fan."

"Robocop worked for me on so many levels that it is still my personal pick for the best film of all time. As a science fiction film, it works because it suspends disbelief in a brilliant manner. It accomplishes this because it only has a single fantasy element - RoboCop. As a drama, it works so well because of, among other things, a score by Basil Poledouris that I can still picture the film going along in front of me when I listen to the music by itself. As a comedy, it works brilliantly because it spares no opportunity to take a shot at the attitude that destroyed America's industrial might, the \"who cares if it works, the people will buy what we make\" attitude. As an action film, it works because the entire style of the film is \"too much\", as Paul Verhoeven states eloquently during the commentary. One of the best elements for me was RoboCop himself. All of my life, people have been stealing things from me. The scummy fiends who passed themselves off as teachers during my childhood robbed me of any desire to formally educate myself. The child abusers who call themselves child psychologists stole years of my life with false statements and false reasoning. Ever since I saw this film in 1988, I wanted to be turned into a mechanised hulk so that I could make them pay by stealing their lives from them. Coupling this element with the corporate greed that leads to the creation of RoboCop is a gang led by Clarence, the most hyperactive and hyper violent villain I've seen in my life. If you added boobs to the guy, he would have perfectly resembled this schoolteacher I'd like to shoot apart in the same manner that the gang shoots Murphy apart. The manner in which he is killed by RoboCop had me standing up and clapping, it was executed so well, and so surprisingly. Where I am concerned, a Christ theme has to have three things. It has to have a likable protagonist, and this is something RoboCop delivers. It also has to have a multi-dimensional villain that I can identify with in spite of hating more than the Christian Coalition, and RoboCop delivers that as well. Lastly, it has to introduce and bind all its elements together in the most powerful manner possible. And RoboCop more than delivers. The scene in which RoboCop first walks into the police precinct is so well-realised that I still hear Ozzy Osbourne growling \"I am Iron Man!\" in my head whenever I watch it. Don't let the negative comments of those who don't understand the film fool you. As a man who studies literature and the English language like it is growing out of his ears, I can firmly tell you that this is the best Christ theme of the twentieth century, bar none. Rivalled only by the Star Wars saga, and successfully gripping in ways where The Matrix was just pathetic and hilarious, if you only ever see one film about justice, make it this one!" "I'm 15. I remember I had a tape of Robocop and I had been watching it for 7 years, but I didn't realize, at the time, that I had been watching the edited version the whole time. I didn't finally get a chance to see the uncut version until about 3 years ago. I have to admit that I had missed a lot during those 7 years. Boy I was in for a rude awakening when I watched this. Robocop has to be one of the violentist movies of the late 1980's. The scene where Murphy is murdered by Clarence and his thugs is absolutely horrific. The ED209 test scene is also horrific in a sense. Everything in Robocop is perfect. The cast, especially Kurtwood Smith's character is clearly an evil man, with no remorse or guilt for his ruthless actions and you know that his own demise will be very deserving. Peter Weller is the perfect choice for the unwilling and troubled Robocop who is haunted by the memories of his family as well as his own murder. 10/10" "STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs Having watched this unforgettable action/sci-fi classic again last time after at least 2 and a half years,I am still completely awed by it.There is'nt a level this masterpiece dos'nt work on.As an action movie,as an intelligent vision of the future (more intelligent and understandable than Blade Runner ever was,and imaginative too)and in terms of brilliantly written charecters.This film is nearly 15 years old,and still today,the special effects are as breathtakingly amazing as they were back then.They are utterly timeless.I certainly hope,in 2002,this film gets some kind of 15th anniversary celebration,like Fawlty Towers celebrated 25 years on UK Gold,maybe a re release on mainstream video for this one. Another thing I came to decide having seen this again,was that all the spin offs from it,the two sequels and the TV series,were for losers.Yes,accept no imitations,this is the definitive,only version of Robocop.Take no notice of the rest of that crap,this now glares out to me as the one main,most important instance where they should have just left the original how it is.*****" "\"RoboCop\" was a major surprise for me when I saw it back in 1987. I didn't think this was going to be all that great. It looked ugly and grimy, and usually movies that look ugly and grimy turn me off. I saw it, and I was glad because this movie took me by surprise. \"RoboCop\" is a very entertaining (and very violent) science fiction/action/thriller that works on just about every level. Peter Weller stars as Alex Murphy, a cop in the city of Old Detroit who gets killed in the line of duty by some truly hateful criminals. Afterwards he is brought back to life, but not as a normal human being. The evil corporation OCP that runs all the police departments have turned this man into RoboCop, part man, part machine. They feel that since crime rate is at an absolute high (and since their earlier robotic experiment ED-209 was a big violent flop), RoboCop is the answer to stop it. And boy does he ever. However there's a little twist in between all the violence. He still has memories of when he was Murphy, and remembers the creeps who killed him. With the help of his partner Lewis (played wonderfully by Nancy Allen), they go after the bad guys. The two main villains in the film give brilliant performances. Veteran character actor Ronny Cox had his first nasty role here as Dick Jones, the #2 guy at the OCP department who creates ED-209 and becomes mad as hell when a younger OCP executive creates RoboCop after the ED-209 experiment fails; and Kurtwood Smith gives one of the meanest performances of all-time as Clarence Bodicker, the leader of the evil gang that kills Murphy. It's really hard to believe that a decade after playing this memorably evil bad guy, Smith would go on to do comedy on the current TV sitcom \"That 70's Show\". As for the other performances, Weller is perfect in the lead, Allen has one of her best film roles as the sidekick, Miguel Ferrer is very good as Morton, RoboCop's creator, Robert DoQui is very funny as Sgt. Reed (the boss at police headquarters where Murphy/RoboCop works at), and Daniel O'Herlihy has a nice small part as the head of OCP who is known to everyone as the Old Man. \"RoboCop\" was Dutch director Paul Verhoeven's first American movie, and it's a winner. One of the things that he does here that really makes the film work is the sense of humor that he put into it. Even though \"RoboCop\" is brutally violent at times, it's also brutally hilarious. I laughed a lot while watching this movie, and that was the biggest surprise for me. But the main reason to see \"RoboCop\" are the action and special effects sequences, and they're terrific. The film is ugly and grimy at times which I expected, but in the long run, it didn't bother me. \"RoboCop\" is so well-made that I didn't care if it looked bleak. This is an excellent movie. And forget about the two sequels that followed. Neither \"RoboCop 2\" or \"RoboCop 3\" came close to matching the excitement, humor, and thrills of the original. ***1/2 (out of four)" "Wow, I love this movie so much. I just bought the Criterion DVD edition and it is worth every penny. Lots of cool extras (audio commentary, storyboards, etc) and the violent scenes are now uncut bloodier and more gruesome than before! This is my favorite film Paul Verhoeven has made, with Total Recall as a close #2. Hidden underneath all the ultra-violence and comic-book-style special effects there is a brilliant satire of what America was about in the 1980s. The acting very underrated as each actor gives a colorful performance which suits their characters perfectly. Ronny Cox plays a great villan and I can't understand why he is never used much in other movies. The entire cast is great. Peter Weller is the perfect choice to play Robocop. The music score and sound are done very well, and a real treat to experience on a home theater system. One of my favorite movies, and one of the best Science Fiction movies I've ever seen. They just don't make movies like this anymore and forget about the sequels to this too." "Robocop is Paul Veherhoven at his finest. The movie is not for the faint of heart. It is a gory, gritty, and very powerful movie that is both visually stunning and emotionally draining. The violence in this movie is intense. There are some scenes that will cause some people to cringe. However, underneath Robocop are some powerful messages about society, the media, business, crime, and identity. Dick Jones says \"Good business is where you find it.\" A laughable premise in such a violent movie, until you realize that many businesses behave no differently than the crooks in this movie." "When Robocop premiered in Copenhagen, released in what was - and still is - Denmark´s biggest cinema (the Imperial), the reviews where to some extent furious. One even cried out, -The stinkiest of movies on Copenhagen´s largest screen! I, however, had the thrill of my life. Now I´m not a violent man - as a matter of fact far from it - I couldn´t harm a fly. But this film, despite it´s over-use of graphic violence, grabbed me by the you know what and held me firmly to the seat. For the last decade or so I´ve seen it perhaps 20 times, and it still amazes me how Verhoeven has managed to put a film together that has a lot to say - beneath the surface of ultraviolence. Especially the news - and commercial spots are todays classics, and to make matters worse, some of it´s prophecies almost happen these days. The pace is excellent, filming by Jost Vacano is clearly innovative and Basil Poledouris´ score is superb. When it comes to stop-animation it might be goofy-looking today, but at the time of release it was state of the art. And given the fact that Peter Weller is actually convincing as metallic monster you might even talk about good acting. I could go on and on, but then I would begin to bore you. However, Verhoeven probably had no idea he made what became an all time SciFi-classic, but the sequel (Tom Noonan is OK) and in particular the third Robocop do no more good than a one-legged man in an a** kicking contest. Maybe my mind is a mess - Robocop ranks in my over-all top 3.and it has to be considered a clean 10." "It is simply impossible to criticise this film. It is totally efficient and without a single flaw in any aspect. The plot is beautifully constructed, goes at breakneck pace, and is filled with stunning set pieces. The script is witty, very quotable (\"Stay out of trouble\") and it doesn't let a single line go to waste. The amazing shiny, metallic special effects invoke a vision of the future in which capitalism is rampant - remember this was before the Berlin Wall fell and Communism collapsed. It is totally plausible. This could have just been a straightforward action movie, but Verhoeven has turned it into a revenge thriller, a quest for identity, a parallel of Jesus' death-and-rebirth (at one stage Murphy walks on water) and a hilarious comedy rolled into one." "... Or, Paul Verhoeven conquers the world. More people have seen RoboCop than probably any other film by him, and his genius is that he can work in big-budget genres and never stoop to thinking that he ought to be more responsible. RoboCop is funny, violent, clever and moving. No sane person would ever want to _watch_ a sequel, let alone make one. People accuse Verhoeven of crypto-fascism, in that he never seems to offer some sort of \"positive\" alternative to the nightmare worlds he portrays. But he says, and I agree with him, that he's just being realistic. A great film. He didn't make another one as good until Starship Troopers." "Robocop's vision of the future is somewhat dark and gritty but proves to be a most enjoyable tale of Alex Murphy (Peter Weller), the good cop who gets killed in the line of duty. Only to be reborn as a high tech tool of justice. This is the first of what have become the more memorable Paul Verhoeven films and definitely the best of the Robocop series. His almost trade mark use of blood and excessive violence is evident here and often leaves you wincing in sympathetic pain for the characters on screen, you honestly start felling sorry for some of them. The movie works well on a number of levels and proves to be a highly entertaining action film with just a hint of something higher at work. As an action film it is highly successful, it provides witty one liners and makes for excellent bang for your buck. But as a social satire it also functions, it makes a healthy stab at the values we are adopting in out lives. As Science Fiction it is one of the more enjoyable outings of the late eighties. It is interesting to note the characters in this a clever little film. Most of the human characters seem shallow, yet logically the most shallow character (Robocop) seems to be the only human element in the film. The movie follows a pretty predictable story line, boy makes good, boy goes out for revenge, boy is framed, boy comes back as a hero despite all odds. Despite the lack of a surprising story, it is still is a highly entertaining film, providing as many gasps as laughs and leaves you at the end of it thinking `Hell I wanna be a Robot!' It is however interesting to note that yes old Robo is cased in Titanium, practically invincible to the oncoming onslaught of bullets and other things nasty that no one thinks to shoot him in the mouth. Its not like he's moving too fast for them to do this. I wonder perhaps if he also has Titanium teeth."

"Robocop is not a film I was keen to see. I am not a big fan of action movies, especially when they forsake story and characters for yet more special effects. So, the prospect of watching a cyborg hero shooting his way through villains in futuristic Los Angeles left me rather unimpressed. However, when I finally saw the film, it blew me away. Robocop is a wolf in a sheep's skin. It is a satire written for people who hate satires. Most people who'll see this film won't even notice. Robocop is Paul Verhoeven's 'Modern Times', but it is much subtler in delivering its message than Chaplin. Superficially we are given a vision of the future, a bleak future with rampant crime and rampant capitalism. It is not an entirely consistent vision, as advances/changes in science and society are immense while people still seem to wear the same clothes, live in the same houses, go to the same shops, drive the same cars as they did in 1987. Well, it is 1987. We are not shown the future at all, we are shown a caricature of today, we see the present through the eyes of a cartoonist. Robocop works perfectly well as an action flick and it delivers all the cliches we expect; since it has more humour than your average special effects bonanza it is very entertaining to watch. What makes it special though is the social comment beneath the surface." "In a dystopia future, crime ridden Detroit is being protected by a police force run by Omni Consumer Products. Omni is looking to replace inner city Detroit with Delta City. They want to clean up the crime with new robotic cops. When the latest robot ED 209 malfunctions, they need RoboCop as the backup plan. Officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is new in the dangerous precinct, and he's paired up with the rough Officer Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen). In a wild chase with master criminal Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith), Alex is captured and seriously tortured. When he dies, Omni takes ownership of his body to create RoboCop. This is great 80s sci-fi action. It is fun. The FX is good for the 80s. The cheese factor is high, but it's never ridiculous. RoboCop looks super cool. I wish they had better CGI back then, and better production value. Sometimes the action looks light. The production design lacks imagination with the exception of RoboCop and ED 209. There are good fun actors especially Miguel Ferrer and Ronny Cox. Miguel is great as the sleazy corporate climber. The story has just enough dark social commentary." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Dead or alive, you're coming with me. In the future Detroit is overrun with crime to the point that the police department has become aligned(albeit reluctantly)with a technological corporation known as OCP who are planning to rebuild the city \"for the better\", to provide better homes and increase employment across the board. They are also in the process of creating robotic police officers to replace human ones and decrease the rate of crime. Dick Jones(a ruthless Ronny Cox)is VP to \"the old man\", head of OCP(Dan O'Herlihy), but loses his position when a giant robot his division had been working on \"has a glitch\" which results in the murder of an employee during a presentation. The eager Bob Morton(Miguel Ferrer portraying his usual asshole)swoops in to present a robotic creation of his own, due to appear as soon as he can get the right kind of \"parts\" to assimilate the \"new breed of cop\". That happens when a police officer, Murphy(Peter Weller), is crucified(director Verhoeven claims in an interview that he wanted the cop's brutal murder to mirror Jesus Christ's own death)by a vicious drug lord, Clarence J Boddicker(a repulsive Kurtwood Smith)and his gang(including Ray Wise and Paul McCrane). His partner, Anne(a deglammed Nancy Allen), sees this horrifying development and later recognizes that parts of him had been used for OCP's Robocop(mainly his face and brain and perhaps some internal organs shielded by armor). This is what Bob proudly unveils--a robotic, programmed police officer designed to apprehend suspects and follow directives assigned to him through OCP. So is the plot where Robocop dutifully goes out to halt crimes in progress--a rape, liquor store robbery, gas station robbery, Robocop steps in as an avenger with a badge, but something happens that Bob and his scientists didn't anticipate. Murphy, somehow, remains active despite a \"brain sweep\" and bits of humanity emerge, memories(particularly of those who murdered him)resurface, giving Robocop an incentive to pursue those who killed the man he once was. Secretly Jones and Boddicker are actually in cahoots, first eliminating a thorn in their side, Bob, and soon focusing on getting rid of Robocop. Will these heathens be successful or will Murphy get his revenge? Through Verhoeven's superb direction(the way he stages the action scenes, interspersing live action with stop motion effects, not to mention, the camera-work and overall pacing and style), a wicked, witty, razor-sharp script(the satire on commercialism, materialistic society, and dangers of potential technological breakthroughs placed in the hands of the wrong people) , really vile villains worthy of destruction(Murphy's sadistic demise makes him quite the worthy figure of sympathy), and awe-inspiring depictions of Robocop(and especially Ed 209)at work--along with the magnificent make-up and Robocop design by Rob Bottin, as well as, Basil Poledouris' rousing, stirring score--this action-packed, ultra-violent sci-fi extravaganza has stood the test of time. I think it's just as riveting a sci-fi action flick as THE TERMINATOR, it's brother so to speak. There's plenty of acidic humor which deftly matches the overall tone of the film, it's a dangerous world out there, both in the boardroom and on the streets. Phil Tippett and his stop motion team do a phenomenal job with Ed 209, with Verhoeven and company amazingly able to effectively have the giant robot occupy the same screen as human characters. The highlight for me, besides the human atomic monster splattered across a car, would be the battle between Robocop and Ed 209 inside OCP headquarters, the building taking as much damage as the combating robots." "This one goes for the jugular. Verhoeven has never exactly had a reputation for the light, the family friendly, or holding back in criticism. As one of his satires, this is quite simply excellent and utterly ferocious, in its depiction of society and big business... of the future. Yes, that's it. The writing is marvelous. The dialog is endlessly quotable. The characters are credible and portrayed well. The gritty, and sometimes intentionally over-the-top tone is masterfully achieved, and lasts for the entire duration. The action is incredible, and all memorable. The suit is amazing. The special effects are extremely well-done, with a handful of exceptions, most having to do with limitations of the time. The symbolism is exceptional. Consider what not to take at face value in this. As with other of Paul's works, bring your brain for this one, if for absolutely no other reason, remember it says \"sci-fi\" as a genre, also. Be aware that there are fairly gruesome and disturbing things in this, some would call it downright distasteful, most notably in the violence and themes, and \"intense\" isn't exactly a wrong word to associate with this. The Parents Guide on here can help let you know what to expect, if such bothers you. There is also a little nudity, and plenty of language. I recommend this to any fan of science fiction, any of the actors(Kurtwood Smith can be a bad-ass), of clever films, and of the concept. 8/10" "This is the first installment of the Robocop movies and I to this day still love it. The story is very well done and for 1987, a little ahead of it's time. The concept of Robocop is intelligently written. The setup is Detroit. The city is overrun by crime and the police are so concerned with it that showing up at work could be their last day in ever. This filming is so well done that you, the viewer feel like you are a part of this depressing and worn out police station. I won't go into details any further, but the acting is solid, the story is well done, and the villains are SO nasty that you will really hate them. If your a squeamish one, be careful. This movie is pretty damn violent. The Last Word: This is a solid and fun ride. Still remains a classic, just avoid the sequels." "Robocop has to be one of the most perfect and flawless transitions of sci-fi concepts/comics/cartoons into a real motion picture. While those are normally recipies for disaster, for once it actually looks better and luck may have even played a huge part given how the concept fits perfectly. The movie is not all about action either and has a huge emotional element to it. Plenty of surprises and an excellent plot await if you have not already seen this movie. The special effects are as well developed as those times allowed. Unfortunately, the sequels have been highly disappointing. Even the TV series cannot touch this and may even kill interest in this franchise." "Robocop is the most violent movie ever made. Taxi Driver has to be next. The first time I saw this movie I was about 14. Now that I am a little older I understand it more. I bought the movie in its unrated version and I noticed how much they cut out. This movie was cut to avoid an X rating. Now I have the cut version again. The thing I like about getting the R rated and unrated versions are comparing the two. I think Peter Weller does a good job as Alex Murphy. Also Nancy Allen does a good job also as his partner. Ronny Cox is the best villain. I think the commercials are hilarious. I think Total Recall is more violent than this is." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "It starts out interesting enough Two cops, Murphy (Peter Weller) and Lewis (Nancy Allen), take off in pursuit some crooks in a moderately well-done car chase. Murphy and Lewis catch up to them in a warehouse. They separate, and Lewis is forced to watch as they almost obliterate her partner. She gets him to a hospital where he is clinically pronounced dead. Meanwhile, OCP, the company that provides most of the funding and technology to law enforcement agencies has developed a new Cyborg project, and as you may suspect, Murphy becomes their first test subject. The brazenness of the film is tempered with the director's care to take the material seriously. So while the dialog is a bit cheesy and the criminals are highly exaggerated, the plot does not suffer. More attention could've been given to character writing, but that fails to scar the film. The set design as well as Robocop's suit and armor are superlative for its time, and the music is well-scored and apposite for each scene. The design of ED-209 was also considerably advanced for its time, and the further personification of it added some light humor, especially when it fell down the stairs. The art department did a incredible job with Emil's (Paul McCrane) skin meltingit was surprisingly realistic. However, the latter squirting blood almost made me laugh out loud. I guess ya win some, ya lose some. Despite the fact that Weller (Robocop) is limited in his acting since he plays a Cyborg, you still feel his loneliness and isolation. Lewis recognizing him and helping him was handled well. Furthermore, you can really feel the injustice of it all in the scene in the garage when all the cops open fire on him. I wish it was explained more what parts of him are human and what is Cyborg, but I suppose one can infer this from his actions. The Old Man (Dan O'Herlihy) firing Dick thus enabling Robocop to kill him was niceI actually didn't see it coming. And the last scene where The Old Man asks RoboCop his name gave the film closure. VERDICT: The performances are nothing special to behold, but even now, it is *still* abundantly clear that this film set a milestone for its time, and can be appreciated as such. Recommended to all, whether you're in search of an original futuristic film or just looking for something to pass the time. 7.0 out of 10.0" "If you're a man and you have not seen RoboCop, you might as well not have a penis. One simply cannot describe themselves as men unless this movie has been viewed by their own eyes...and enjoyed. I say that because RoboCop is a film made just for men, a great one at that, and if you haven't seen it then there's something seriously wrong with you. And if you have seen it and don't like it, you could possibly be a woman, have a hormonal imbalance causing a lack of testosterone, or are a serious steroid juicer. Either way, it comes down to the penis and or lack thereof. Don't let it go to waste by not enjoying this movie. Respect it. Now that that's out of the way, let's get to the damn film shall we? RoboCop has everything an essential action movie needs, violence, destruction, guns, an evil antagonist (played marvelously by Kurtwood Smith), and of course the classic one-liners. The film exceeds above the rest in the same genre because of a slick script and good direction...not to mention just one kickass idea to start with. Some of the effects have aged, particularly the animation sequences featuring the Godsend of man-movie villains, the ED-209. Although they have aged, naturally, I don't feel that it takes away from the film. And let's face it, the ED-209 is just bad. I would love to have one for myself, you know, for simple entertainment purposes. hmmm. I'll just leave it at that just because I don't want any G-men showing up at my door. I would not be too quick to label this film as clichéd either. It was made in the '80s, where almost all action and sci-fi clichés were created, so one must not take too much away from the film simply because of this fact. All in all, an excellent film, even if it is a simple action flick. Not only that, this film was a trend setter in it's day...this fact cannot be denied. The hand scene alone, although ultra-violent and simple, is something that will never be forgotten. And now that we have the wonderful technology of DVD's, one can now watch this beloved scene in slow motion. Sometimes I think things are invented and created just for me. But then again, maybe I have problems. Overall, RoboCop is an excellent action/sci-fi film that set the stage for films the come. And although it's still a simple action flick, it is a definite unique, creative, and well-made one. I highly recommend this film to any man with a penis." "On his first day out on the streets of Detroit, Officer Murphy is brutally killed by known thug leader, Clarence Boddicker. Scientists at OCP are able to use what remains of Murphy's body and build a new heavily armed cyborg police officer, one that could rid the streets of crime forever. Paul Verhoeven has been called many things in his career, bonkers, challenging and visionary, here with his first perceived block buster American feature, he showcases all of those things. Robocop on the page {and with its title} looked like your average run of the mill sci-fi shoot them up, with its basic premise not exactly oozing originality either. But Verhoeven had screenwriter's Edward Neumeier & Michael Miner in his corner, and they came up with a superior script to fully realise his vision. That Robocop is a satirical critique of totalitarianism and corporate corruption is now a given. Yet it wasn't at first evident to the summer block buster crowd, but Robocop has stood up well to critical re-examinations and the depth digging that so many have afforded it. So with the script he wanted in place, Verhoeven utilised his memories from childhood, where his Netherlands home was taken over by a stomping German army, and added in the destruction factor, with no amount of technical expertise as well. Verhoeven paints an unhinged portrait of this Detroit {actual location shoot was parts of Texas}, with skew whiff angles and bizarre twists lining the picture, the special effects even today looking tremendous. Robocop is extremely violent, especially in the directors cut that's now widely available, but even during the most wincing scenes, it stays brisk and sparky, and on his side is that his characters are as inhuman as the title protagonist is!. Thus the fusion of berserker sci-fi and human realism sits easy with the viewer, with the result serving notice to what a fine director Verhoeven can be. Peter Weller dons the Robo suit {enduring agony for weeks on end apparently} and does what is required, and Nancy Allen kicks buttocks as Murphy's partner, Anne Lewis. But it's with the unsavoury characters that Robocop gains its acting kudos. Ronny Cox, Miguel Ferrer and a wickedly vile Kurtwood Smith dominate proceedings, helped immeasurably by the nature of the script. Verhoeven is thought to be a hard character on set, demanding much from all involved, even driving the normally amiable Weller to thoughts of violence against his director. But few, if any of those involved in Robocop can now say the final result wasn't worth it, because between them they made a genre classic. 9/10" "Add another review" "Find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your Watchlist and rate your favorite movies and TV shows on your phone or tablet!")("Movies, TV & Showtimes" "Celebs, Events & Photos" "News & Community" "Watchlist" "" "Find industry contacts & talent representation" "Manage your photos, credits, & more" "Showcase yourself on IMDb & Amazon" "Sign in with Facebook Other Sign in options" "Own the rights?" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "For a movie that is 30 years old, the social commentary is still great. Its got commercials for fake futuristic products, the fun of crazy action sequences, and one of my all-time favorite robots/droids in ED- 209. ED-209 is great and I wish someone made a small one that really interacted with you without telling me it was going to shoot me then actually shooting me. I don't need toys that murder. Peter Weller is great and the supporting cast is equally astounding. In watching this with the commentary I was shocked at how much thought went in to each scene. My only concern would be how violent and hard-R rated it is. I will have to wait until my children are at least 5 to watch it (just kidding)." "I've watched this about a million times and I liked it. I loved the action scenes including the shoot out in the factory. I like the special effects with ED-209 and Robocop. The commercials in this film made it a bit humorous. I used to have a Robocop action figure but it doesn't work anymore and it's lost. That's the reason why I like Robocop." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Robocop 1987 Robocop is a film I hold very close to my heart. As a school boy when this film was released my father wouldn't allow me to watch it. The graphic violence and foul language was deemed unfit for an eleven year old boy and rightly so. I begged and pleaded but dad wouldn't budge. His mind was set. My school friends however had all seen it. I don't think there was a VHS copy in my neighbourhood that hadn't been played within an inch of its life. Of course every school break time was filled with discussion of this sci-fi masterpiece. So I learned the film from start to finish without even laying my eyes on the screen. Every line, every scene all in my imagination as I listened in awe to my friends as they retold the tale of Alex Murphy a Detroit police officer who is violently gunned down by a gang of vicious criminals and then reconstructed as a crime fighting cyborg. I say violently but even that is an understatement. If you opt to watch the directors cut the gore of Murphy's deconstruction is almost too much to bare. Limbs are detached from body with murderous gunfire. The violence feels real, you can almost taste the brain matter. But this is necessary in order to convey the brutal world these characters live in. Paul Verhoevens film pokes fun at modern day America and the massive corporations that control our lives. All of this is done with a good dose of satire and a wink at the camera. The TV commercials that play throughout the movie are a work of genius. A particular one involving a gas guzzling American made car named the 6000 SUX, an American tradition which proudly returns 8.2mpg. There are so many delights in this film that are wasted on an eleven year old school boy. However when my father finally came around some few years later and allowed me to watch this movie I was blown away like Murphy himself. My imagination was being presented before me right there on the screen. I knew every line but to see it actually happening was mesmerising. The performances are exceptional, particularly by Peter Weller as Robocop. His movement, his on screen presence. A story of a man becoming a machine and then a man again perfectly portrayed. Supporting cast are also superb. Kurtwood Smith created one of the most evil and memorable villains since Darth Vader. Granted the special effects by today's standards look weak but compared to the recent remake, the original film has depth and texture. No CGI can replicate this. Take ED209 for example he is as menacing as he is comical. A killer robot tank that is flummoxed by a staircase. The clumsy stop motion effects only elevate this. I recently revisited this film and after thirty years I am still bowled over by its genius. Robocop is more than just an action flick it's a clever and comical finger poke at the world we live in." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This is one of the most clever and influential pieces, not just for science-fiction, but film as a whole. I can explain the sudden drop in ratings. It's ignorant people rating this down because they're confusing it with the 2014 film. That is a remake of this film. Watch this film and culture yourselves." "One thing I don't think I ever hear mentioned about \"RoboCop\" is the sound design. His movements and footsteps sound fantastic, and they're as unique as the sound of a proton pack, lightsaber or time- traveling DeLorean. It's one of the many reasons this is such an enduring movie. \"RoboCop\" is so effective because it strikes the precise balance between human drama and the comic book outrageous. It's got everything: memorable villains, great score, mid-'80s ultra-violence, cheap (hysterical) jabs at corporate America and a delightfully glib outlook on the media. Seriously, absorb just five minutes of present-day cable news, and suddenly those Media Break segments seem all too real. I think that's more unnerving than how the movie presaged the woeful state of Detroit. There's a real heart to this movie, which is why it's one of my all-time favorites. The idea that a corporation can own anything from the police to an entire city - but not a man's soul. I dunno, even after all of the bloodspray and beautiful matte paintings, what really brings a smile to my face is the main character's utterance of his own name in the closing moments. I mean, really, does it get any better than that? 10/10" "The ads in this movie are hilarious, a very nice unexpected touch. They're not explained but fit in with the tone and are perfect as comic relief. The movie clearly has a sense of irony and exaggeration about it. The violence is over-the-top. Cops are getting killed left and right. No character is safe from getting hurt. The story keeps moving so it's easy to be engaged the whole time. Robocop is like the perfect boy's movie except it's too violent for kids. It's loaded with testosterone. It's got guns, cars, goodies and baddies, explosions, blood, shoot-outs, chases, angry old guys shouting, a giant robot and Robocop himself. It's only missing hot women in terms of the male fantasy. Whatever we watch action films for, Robocop has a good amount of it. Many parts were exciting to watch and made me laugh or at least smile a lot. The robot, ED-209, is extremely cool. The stop-motion animation is jumpy but detailed and effective and the sound-effects and mean voice are intimidating. You really feel his presence. I'm sure I would instantly drop to the ground and wet my pants if he threatened me :) Robocop himself has an interesting aura around him. He's like a superhero. The other police are curious about him. He's tall and moves mechanically but appears friendly and reliable. Against criminals, he's efficient and apparently indestructible. We're not sure how human or awake or alive he is but that gets developed throughout the movie in a satisfying way. I would have liked to see a sequel except they aren't meant to be very good. Like Spider-man and Batman, his relationship with society and the police is rocky. Sometimes he's respected and looked up to. Other times there is fear and distrust. This movie is violent and dark but still manages to be fun and entertaining. It's not too grim and has a sense of humour about itself. Many of the characters are jerks and we basically celebrate when they get killed. They're archetypes of the kinds of people everyone hates. The bad guys are hilariously 1-dimensional. What I like is how Robocop cuts straight to the point. Everything about a person is obvious from the start. There may be little twists or surprises but at least we know where people's hearts are. The swearing is particularly refreshing and enjoyable. It's such an efficient way to express feelings which is used appropriately and to great effect here. Robocop gives hope to a city that's halfway to hell. There is a nice human element. The ongoing struggle between the police and criminals. The camaraderie they each have among themselves. Like Batman, Robocop is shaking things up which some people like and some don't. I didn't like the first two X-men movies because they were stupid and yet took themselves so seriously. They weren't fun. Robocop doesn't make that mistake. It doesn't pretend to be anything more than a story about this awesome cop-robot-thing going around killing bad guys. And yet, because of its irony and fearlessness, there are plenty of ideas that come up throughout this movie. Can we trust an armed machine to enforce the law? Will that happen in the future? How much risk is acceptable? Is the news anything more than mere entertainment? The male reporter seems to smile the whole time in this movie. Is it ever moral to kill? And why are men obsessed with big guns and cars (other than them being inherently awesome)?" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "From a visceral standpoint a heck of a good movie. Revenge from Murphy for his murder by the thugs, the return of at least some humanity to Robocop from Nancy Allen. When Robocop goes in to the drug lab he is looking for the ones who \"killed\" him. He takes out I don't know how many of them, goes after the number two man, Dick Jones, at OCP. This is where directive four comes in to play, any attempt to arrest a senior OCP officer will lead to shut down. Going to arrest the smarmy faced Dicky Robocop overcomes the shut down, encounters the Robocop upgrade, goes to the basement where the upgrade can not handle the stairs, gets the crap shot out of him by human cops, is rescued by Nancy Allen. Kurtwood Smith is really good as the A hole crime thug. I love it when he gets his. Nancy Allen brings Robo tools, food, and weapons. Getting some military grade weapons the thugs go after Robo thinking they have the upper hand. I guess they forgot to read the script. They get picked off one by one but of course Kurty runs away, Nancy chases, he crashes and is finally killed. So Robo goes to arrest the Dickey but can't until he is fired. Gee guess what happens now? Dicky not only gets shot to pieces but is blown out a very high window." "In futuristic Detroit, an honest police officer (Peter Weller) is gunned down by a ruthless gang. His body is turned into a robot to be used by the police force. He now makes a cop who is physically tough, has myriad other features like precision targeting and recording statements from criminals and is dedicated to his job. He is an immediate success but what happens when he detects corruption and crime among his superiors. The more realistic a character is the more they elicit the right kind of emotions in the audience, be it like or dislike. That's the reason why we like the villains in superhero flicks; they are not real by any stretch of imagination. RoboCop is similar to a superhero but his rivals are not super villains. They are real people; people with power. They do pose the threat of taking over the city/world because they already own half the city. Their motives are multi-layered and complex. The stakes are high as RoboCop may or may not win the day. And all this leads up to one of the most emotionally intense, action-packed climaxes ever put on cinema. The character of RoboCop has been delicately dealt with. The differences and similarities in his human and robot personalities, the reactions of people towards him, his discovery of his origins and the internal conflict he goes through all feel real. The supporting characters are meaty and well cast. Peter Weller himself does a good job considering he is wearing a heavy costume and his eyes are covered with a helmet for most part of the movie. There is a lot of 80's feel to it for a movie set in the future and some of the effects look dated. But that is just nitpicking as they are not distracting in the least bit." "Paul Verhoeven wanted to implant a Jesus like feeling to the whole notion of being reborn and there are visual clues to that (walking on water and so on). Of course no one would think of Jesus coming back in a violent fashion like that. So it's not a clear cut comparison or analogy for that matter. The violence in the movie is extreme and there are certain scenes you will not forget that easily (and the effects are still holding up). The \"you have 20 seconds to comply\" scene in particular is more than (in)famous. But its also the performance by Peter Weller that carries that story. His relationships with his Ex-Partner and the strange mix of human and robot is more than appealing. A great movie that did stand the test of time" "To me, there is no movie that can compare to such an astonishing, unique, motivating film like this one. Honestly, this movie is the real definition of a movie with a true morality. Robocop truly grasps an unforgettable story that will make you want to repeat this movie in your head endlessly until it's the last memory that you will ever remember. This movie will forever be engraved in my heart and I tend to visualize this movie in my head from time to time. I will never forget such a magnificent film like this one. Robocop is truly an emotional, awe-inspiring movie that just can't be forgotten in such little time. Not only does this film have an amazing storyline to it, but it also has a spectacular cast with amazing acting. This beautiful film will forever be acknowledged by me and I will always love Robocop until death."

"There's no other way of saying it, but Robocop is an absolute classic. Ignore the 'so-so' 2014 remake and concentrate on the original. It's all you need. It was possibly too good and couldn't even be matched by its sequels. Yes, it's hyper-violent and totally adult in nature, but it also has a wonderfully subtle layer of satire underneath all the gore and bloodshed. In case you don't know, a policeman is gunned down in futuristic Detroit, only to be resurrected with no memory of his former life as an indestructible cyborg lawman. Of course his memories soon start to trickle back and he begins to want to track down those who 'killed' him for more than just a slap on the wrist. It's packed full of memorable scenes and catchphrases and the only people who probably won't appreciate this film are those with a real distaste for violence. It really is the perfect little film for what it is. It never tries to be deep and meaningful, only loud, proud and entertaining. And it succeeds of ever one of those levels. http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "I was about seven or eight, when My Mom picked this movie up at one my town's local video stores. Immediately after watching it, I loved it, and on subsequent returns to that video store, I had to incessantly beg my mother to re- rent it for me. Ever since the day I first watched the film, it has been one of my favorite movies. The idea of RoboCop isn't particularly new, many movies, comic books, pulp magazines, short stories, and TV shows, have had more or less the same plot. However RoboCop takes it in a new direction. The plot is this: Things have gone to hell in Detroit, and a mega-corporation known as Omni Consumer Products or O.C.P., has taken control. Crime runs rampant all over the city, and one of the head members of O.C.P., must somehow find a solution to this problem. We then meet the main character: Officer Alex Murphy, who has just transferred to the roughest part of the city. Murphy and his new partner: Officer Anne Lewis, hear of a bank robbery that was committed by a local street gang. Murphy and Lewis pursue them to their hideout. The two police officers get separated, and Murphy is then cornered by the gang members and brutally shot to death. Sometime later, Murphy is resurrected by O.C.P. as the crime fighting cyborg, RoboCop! At first, Murphy has no knowledge or recollection of his life or of his family, but slowly his memories return, and RoboCop/Murphy must rediscover his humanity and seek vengeance for his brutal murder. RoboCop not only has stellar acting, outstanding special effects, but also an excellent and compelling story. This film has one of the most memorable scores, and a brilliant use of satire with its clever \"commercials\". Without a doubt, it is one of the best science- fiction films of all time, and definitely one of the best films to come out of the eighties. Check it out, and see it for yourself!" "One of the pioneers of cyberpunk genre where we look a few decades into the future into a world where crime and corruption rule and its up to few dedicated people to make the difference. RoboCop has earned the reputation of a classic because of its style and harsh satirical critique on modern society and its downfalls. It mocks the modern conventions of trying to make as much money as possible without caring about the end result. It also deals with the themes of identity, corruption, humanity and heroism. And throughout it all it's also a really good action film with blazing gun fights, brutal massacres and lovely special effects - especially for their time. One of the best things about this film is the role performance delivered by Peter Weller, the RoboCop himself. We don't get to see much of his face or expressions because of the helmet, but his voice alone is enough to carry the emotions and feelings he goes through. Even his robotic monotone has enough depth to make us feel for him and whenever a hint of emotion seeps through, it feels like a victory to both him and the viewer. RoboCop is one of those movies that need to be seen for the full experience to sink in. Its plot isn't overly complex, but it's the way the story is told that's important. The little touches. If you're a fan of science fiction or societal satire, then this one is definitely a movie for you." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "I bet it must be a lot of fun working with Paul Verhoeven, so long as you don't mind getting messy! In the 80s, his sci-fi/ action thrillers were some of the most imaginative shows out there. Along with the original TOTAL RECALL, the original ROBOCOP is his best work! And when you went to see one, what would you expect to see? Usually good guys battling bad guys, winding up in some pretty bloody fights. Characters in Verhoeven's films didn't so much get dead as get massacred! Anyway, now that I'm through with my little rant, let's get on to reviewing 1987's ROBOCOP. In some distant future, the city of Detroit has become a violent haven for criminals. Despite the best efforts of the police department, cops become casualties almost on a nightly basis. One morning, Alex Murphy (played expertly by Peter Weller) comes into work, having been transferred from a kinder, gentler precinct. He meets his new partner, Lewis (Nancy Allen) and before you know it, they are chasing after a van of criminals led by mad dog crime boss Clarence Boddicker (played icily by Kurtwood Smith). Following the criminals to their hideout, the cops get separated and Murphy dies in one of the most violent death scenes in movie history. Meanwhile, the head honchos at Omni Consumer Products (OCP, COP, get it?) are in the process of putting together a new law enforcement program. Murphy, now dead, gets enrolled and resurrected as Robocop. However, soon after, he recalls the men who killed him and goes on a rampage to find and apprehend them. There are many different layers of drama going on here, and I won't go into how it all ties together. With the remake out now in theaters, I don't know how it'll compare to the original. Just know that it's a roller-coaster ride of a film with a healthy dose of acid wit!" "Although it was surprisingly better than I expected, having never seen it before, I only watched this because I really liked the new version and wanted to compare the two. First I'll say, the Robo costume was pretty good for an 80's style sci-fi / action film, but the newer one is so much more sleek and mechanical looking. The story to this film is a lot better than I expected, but a lot of scenes were cheesily filmed and acted that I couldn't take most of it seriously. It was entertaining for the most part, although very violent, and still holds up today. This would have probably been one of my favorite films had I seen it in 1987, but seeing this after the impressive newer version, it doesn't quite compare to me. I know that a lot of people will disagree with me and this won't be a popular review, but it is a honest review and my own opinion. Cheers!" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" ". . . Tigers game, which makes Kurtwood Smith's Crimelord character the ONLY link between ROBOCOP's \"old Detroit\" and the REAL Detroit of 1987. Otherwise, the setting for this flick is far too clean, and the characters way too jovial. There's is and was nothing to laugh about in Detroit. There also are NO buildings even close to having a \"95th floor,\" the stated level of \"Omni Consumer Product's\" (OCP's) board room. OCP's grand plan is to ADD two million people to Detroit's population (which plummeted in reality from two million in 1950 to 700,000 and counting down today). This sort of population growth would be outrageous for ANY city in the northern U.S. (you'd have to go to Brazil or China to see such an overnight demographic shift). When Detroit politicians run amok, such as the city councilman in this ROBOCOP, they don't simply demand \"a car with cruise control\"--they filch $19 billion, like Kwame Kilpatrick and his cohorts. In a city where fire fighters hold telethons to restock their stations with toilet paper, there hasn't been any cash available for high tech ANYTHING for decades. But every time you purchase a Little Caesar's pizza, Clarence says the Tigers get better swings." "RoboCop (1987) takes place in the future crime ridden Detroit. After Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) gets massacred by violent robbers that are lead by the ruthless Clearance Boddicker, he gets rebuild by the OCP company as a crime fighting cyborg. This is an awesome 1980's action/sci-fi film. Even though, I have not seen the remake, I guarantee that this film will be way better. Peter Weller was wonderful as Murphy/RoboCop. He was able to be badass, but also maintain a good amount of heart that made us care for him. The part where he gets massacred by Clearance Boddicker's gang has got to be one of the most messed up scenes filmed. When he gets massacred and has everything taken away from him including his humanity, you really sympathize for him. Which is one of the films strongest parts. Kurtwood Smith was awesome as Clearance Boddicker. I really liked his character so much. He was despicable, ruthless, and sadistic, but he was so entertaining to watch. Other cast members do a capable job at their roles, however one that stands out is Ronny Cox as Dick Jones. The direction by Paul Verhoeven is very good and might say this is one of his best films. Also, it is one that put him on the map. The score by Basil Poledouris is very thrilling and gets you invested during the scenes where RoboCop kicks ass. The action scenes are very violent and bloody. This film was filmed during the time when action movies were R-rated, unlike today you have studios trying to make it more kid friendly and just make a quick buck. My only problem with the film is some special effects may seem outdated in today's standards, especially the parts where Dick Jones falls from the building and the ED-209 design looked very clunky, but that isn't to say that it hurts the film. RoboCop is an entertaining film that features many badass moments. Anyone who are fans of the science fiction/action genre then you will more then likely enjoy this film. It is still holds up very well even though some of the special effects are outdated in today's standards. 9/10 stars." "Robocop is one of the greatest SCI-FI/Action films ever made and an excellent,thrilling and unforgettable classic that combines amazing direction,a great cast,explosive Action,a terrific score and outstanding special make-up effects. All of those elements make Robocop one of my all-time favorite Action films and Paul Verhoevan at his best. Set in a futuristic Detroit,Michigan,Robocop tells the story of Alex Murphy(Peter Weller),a cop who has been transferred to a police station on a dangerous side of Detroit where crime is up. While on duty,Murphy is brutally murdered by a group of criminals and left for dead but is brought back to life by mega-corporation OCP(Omni Consumer Products)as Robocop,a half human half machine Cyborg that is assigned to protect and serve the public and uphold the law. But when Robocop starts having memories of his death as Alex Murphy,Robocop wants to hunt down the men who killed him and wants to get them at all costs and whether they're dead or alive they're coming with Robocop. Robocop is one of the most brilliant and dazzling SCI-FI/Action films of the 1980s and of all-time and is one of those movies that is an instant classic from the moment you watch it,an amazing movie that is up there with other excellent and brilliant SCI-FI/Action classics such as Blade Runner,The Terminator,Terminator 2:Judgment Day,Aliens,Predator,Predator 2,Escape From New York and The Road Warrior. Robocop is also a movie that keeps you glued to screen and is like a Comic Book or Graphic Novel coming to life because throughout the film there is an over the top and wild energy that never stops until the very end and everything in Robocop is pushed to the limit whether it's explosions,guns or the violence but despite all of those things Robocop has a style and demented weirdness that makes the movie less serious. There is a politically incorrect in your face no holds barred attitude that I love about Action movies from the 1970s,80s and 90s and is one of the main reasons the film holds up as a classic and has stood the test of time. What I also love about Robocop is that it's apart of the sub genre of SCI-FI that I have always love Dystopian Futuristic film where there is a society,major city or country that takes place in a dark future and Robocop's future in Detroit depicts a bleak future where law enforcement is falling apart,criminals are ruling the streets and big money corporations have taken over pretty much everything. While Robocop does take place in the future the movie never reveals what year Robocop takes place in giving the future in Detroit a more timeless feel. What is also great about Robocop is that while it's still an explosive Action film,there is also a great deal of Humor and Satire that is in the film and it is very funny whether it's with Robocop dealing with the criminals on the streets,the movie mocking American consumer culture,Television commercials or News Media which makes Robocop not only relevant in 1987 but for many years to come. The Humor and Satire can be seen as a precursor to director Paul Verhoeven two other amazing SCI-FI/Action films Total Recall and Starship Troopers. All three films would make a great triple feature. Robocop also has themes in the film dealing with greed,big business corporations and urban decay commenting on the President Reagan era of the 1980s in an honest and sometimes funny way. The Action and violent scenes in Robocop are amazing,bloody and sometimes brutal,(so brutal in fact that Robocop got an X-Rating from the MPAA)but the Action is done in such a way that it matches perfectly with the film's outlandish Comic Book tone. The Action is fast and so relentless you will never have time to catch your breath. The main character Robocop is one of the all-time great movie characters in SCI-FI and Action films because even though he is a machine Robocop is still a human inside the metal flesh and while Robocop is successful as Robocop he begins to discover the human side that he used to be in Alex Murphy and throughout the movie we see Robocop trying to find out who he really was in his past while being a cop. This element gives the movie and main character sadness and levels of depth that separates Robocop from the some of the other Action movies of the 1980s and is one the reasons Robocop is a classic character you will never forget. The ending of Robocop is great,exciting and explosive and is fantastic conclusion that will have you cheering at the screen. An tremendous ending. The cast is great. Peter Weller is excellent as Robocop/Alex Murphy,with Weller bringing power and depth to the role. Nancy Allen is terrific as Officer Anne Lewis,Robocop/Murphy's partner. Daniel O'Herlihy is great as The Old Man,a top executive at OCP. Ronny Cox is wonderful as Dick Jones,a top man at OCP. Kurkwood Smith is fantastic as Clarence Boddicker,a vicious criminal and killer. Miguel Ferrer is terrific as Bob Norton,a rival executive of Dick Jones that helps create Robocop. Robert DoQui(Sergeant Warren Reed),Felton Perry(Johnson),Ray Wise(Leon),Paul McCrane(Emil),Jesse Goins(Joe),Calvin Jung(Steve Minh)and Lee DeBroux(Sal)give good performances as well. The direction by Paul Verhoeven is brilliant and memorable,with Verhoeven always moving the camera and keeping the film moving at a tight pace while also doing a great job with the Action scenes. Incredible direction,Verhoeven. The score by Basil Poledouns is fantastic,powerful,epic and one of the best scores I have ever heard in an Action movie and matches the film perfectly. Amazing score,Poledouns. The special make-up effects by Rob Bottin are outstanding,realistic and is among the best work Bottin has ever done. Dazzling work,Bottin. In final word,if you love Science Fiction,Action Films or Paul Verhoeven,I highly suggest you see Robocop,an excellent,thrilling and unforgettable classic that you can watch again and again. Highly recommended. 10/10." "Robocop has become a cult classic for many movie buffs. And I have to agree. It has a great mix of humour, great dialogue and satire. Many find the violence --over the top--but if taken in context with the whole movie...its really a necessary element. I believe that this film was never---at any point---meant to be taken seriously. The first scenes, where we see two ridiculously funny T.V. presenters sets the tone for what is to come. I don't agree with those who call this science fiction. The word is FUTURISTIC. This is never boring and moves along at a nice pace. The characters are well acted and memorable. Well worth watching ...and like all cult movies...can be enjoyed on multiple viewings." "Things will get worse before they get better (if they ever get better, especially in Detroit). In one possible future, it could become a mad world of ecological, economical, political, and commercial excesses. It could be a terrifying breeding ground for more extreme and violent crime, which would call for a more extreme and powerful type of police officer. Enter RoboCop: a hybrid of man and machine to make a perfect cop. This film starts off hard and fast, and remains perfectly entertaining throughout its short run-time. It's jam-packed with pulpy hardcore action, with loads of shootouts, chases, and some really gnarly kills. The film strikes a perfect pace, never lingering too long on any of the action or drama, but still offering just enough to satisfy. The film gets really extreme with its exaggerated (perhaps cheesy) level of acting, its level of bloodshed, and its satire, but it's awesome that way. Most of the film's appeal, however, is that it's so fundamental and simple. It goes through a basic death-and-rebirth storyline, which provides the origin of the character and drives the rest of the story through retribution and corporate conspiracy. There is just enough attention to the characters to make them relevant and endearing. On top of that, however, the film also packs in a lot of thought-provoking ideas. Some of the funniest and most memorable scenes include faux news reports and commercials with a strong satirical edge, which provides more background on the crazy world RoboCop inhabits. The film breezes through numerous themes regarding capitalism, the mass media, gentrification, and overall dystopia. The film also raises a bunch of pertinent questions regarding technology and its application, especially with a strong man-vs-machine theme at work. Alex Murphy proves definitively that law enforcement can't be fully automated; an officer needs human compassion and free-will. No matter how hard the enemies try to destroy all that makes Murphy human, he triumphs every time, over the machine of society and the machine within him. This film features some crazy and intense photography, the likes of which only Paul Verhoeven can direct. The shots are often tight, with some scenes that use wild and unusual angles. There are a number of point-of-view shots, which are ingenious. Camera movements are solid and smooth. Editing is decent. Acting is over-the-top and exaggerated, for fantastic effect; Peter Weller and Nancy Allen are pretty earnest and great to watch, while Kurtwood Smith, Ronny Cox, and Miguel Ferrer all excel at being bad guys we love to hate. Writing is concise and sharp, and there are quite a few good, memorable lines. This production uses some cheap and outdated props and sets, but the architecture and technology is often used to create a unique post-modern look and style. Costumes are great, and the special effects hold up well. Music is pretty catchy too. RoboCop is one of those films that feels longer than it is, because within the confines of its simple and fundamental story, it crafts a dense storytelling experience that's full of energy as it is full of ideas. Best of all, it's a film with some serious guts: a piece of pulp sci-fi the likes of which you probably won't find too often in Hollywood anymore. Over the film's home video history, there has been both the original R-rated cut and the unrated director's cut available. Really, it only amounts to 30 seconds of additional footage (mostly violence). Recommended for mature audiences. 5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)" "Add another review" "Find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your Watchlist and rate your favorite movies and TV shows on your phone or tablet!")("Movies, TV & Showtimes" "Celebs, Events & Photos" "News & Community" "Watchlist" "" "Find industry contacts & talent representation" "Manage your photos, credits, & more" "Showcase yourself on IMDb & Amazon" "Sign in with Facebook Other Sign in options" "Own the rights?"

What I loved most of all about it was that it did not hold back any punches as far as all of the violence was concerned. There are some pretty intense scenes especially in the unrated version so you probably would not want kids to be watching this movie even though the language for the most part is not too bad at least from how I remember it.

"*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Detroit is ridden with corruption and crime, ran by a company. Officer Murphy and Officer Lewis go about their daily routines when it all goes horribly wrong during an arrest attempt of the nefarious Clarence Boddicker. Officer Lewis is compromised and unable to try to help Murphy, leading to Murphy's violent death. Murphy is reassembled into a cyborg. The experiment is a huge success, until Murphy starts having visions of his past life. Murphy goes on a mission with Officer Lewis to rid Detroit of all evil and more importantly, get revenge Paul Verhoeven made two terrific Sci-Fi films: Total Recall & Robocop. They simply don't make them like this anymore. Spare me the so-called \"remake\" I'm willing to give it a chance, but I have a bad feeling it will suck. We don't need a remake! This one is pretty daring for the time it was made. When I was younger, I was absolutely appalled with Murphy's death. It really upset me to the point where I almost cried. It doesn't do that these days, although it is still a bit disturbing to watch. I wouldn't say the script is exactly top-notch. It actually comes across as somewhat cheesy at times, but Verhoeven has such a grasp on the entertainment that it ends up being an unforgettable action ride. The effects are definitely dated. There is a robot in this movie (Ed- 209) that comes across as incredibly corny with how weak it looks. If you're a fan of violence, dig in! It is time for the signature Verhoeven violence. We get a cornucopia of bloody gunshot wounds, impailings, someone explodes in half when hit by a car, and someone's arm is shot off. We also get a spike in the neck. The acting is solid. Peter Weller is appropriately shy and subtle as Murphy while firing off some great lines as Robocop. The man took what could have been a one-dimensional part and made it into his own. I just wish more background on his family was revealed. Those scenes were riveting. I felt Murphy's pain. Nancy Allen is slightly awkward in her role. She seemed a bit unsure on what to do but she's still oddly charming. Her chemistry with Weller was great as well. Ronny Cox is absolutely terrific as a villain and Kurtwood Smith is his match as the other villain. Kurtwood is clearly having a blast in his role. He turns it up a few notches in this one. Miguel Ferrer is wonderfully slimy in his role and chewed up the scenery. This man can do no wrong in my eyes. Even Ray Wise has a role in this one. Final Thoughts: Robocop was so influential at one point, a wrestling company known as WCW (World Championship Wrestling) had Robocop appear on a PPV. It didn't work out very well, but that doesn't matter. As far as entertainment is concerned, it doesn't get much better than this for action movies. This comes highly recommended, creep! 9/10" "In a desensitized near-future overrun with corruption, police officer Weller is brutally murdered by a gang of criminals and is revived as a superhuman cyborg. Spot on when initially released. Weller's miming is well executed and much of the SFX still holds up. The stop-motion of the droid in the boardroom scene dates very poorly, but the tragic event within the scene is as chilling as ever. Even though the film achieves at having an assortment of very heartless bad guys, their deeds still seem a bit inexplicable and over-the-top even for the bleak world the story is set in. Some of the character-arcs are a bit bumpy and the ending seems slightly rushed. Criticism aside, ROBOCOP is one of the few sci-fi action films of the '80s that has withstood the test of time. *** (out of four)" "Brilliant sci-fi movie, well-thought and fantastic from various perspectives. The movie makes a point at different levels. At the physical level by being a plain revenge-drama. At the social level of making a case of where to draw the line of privatisation and automation. At the metaphysical level of longetivity of the subconscious, even beyond physical death. The sarcasms on our daily double-standards are hilarious and in a way, ahead of it's time! In a sense, the director took a risk by creating a soul, but succeeded by elevating, what would otherwise have been a plain-jane action movie." "I first saw Robocop when I was 5 years old...yes I was only 5. I've got my grandparents to thank for that little mistake. I remember being absolutely petrified by it. Walking armoured machines with really sinister voices saying I had 20 seconds to comply, Murphy's disgustingly disturbing death, Robocop's struggle to hold onto his humanity....and THAT scene (which I'll get to in a moment).  22 years later, the remake has been announced with a few impressive names attached to the film and with the first Omnicorp viral doing the rounds I thought it may be time to revisit Detroit's finest. So for the second time in my life, and considering my ever-growing experience watching fantastic pieces of work, was it any good? Hmmm sort of. What I would say immediately is that (believe it or not) Robocop is not really about a cyborg policeman. The film tries to relay a message so much bigger than the future of law enforcement. Paul Verhoeven and Ed Neumeier have gone on record to say as much. To be honest without their conformation the film does blatantly show this. Robocop is an attempt to expose America for what they think it is, money hungry. The film is bathed in images and dialogue which portrays a disgusting country that has lost its sense of pride.  In my opinion, the best parts of the film involved key executives of Omnicorp, the villainous organisation that has its grip firmly on Detroit. The suits are portrayed as the school frat boys of business desperately wanting get ahead of the other in popularity and riches. The famous ED-209 scene in the board room is particularly important to show this. To this day it was still pretty scary to watch and incredibly violent, but what was interesting to see was how dumbed down the reactions were from the members of the board. I don't think this was a case of bad acting or direction, I think this was an intentional  move to show that to us it's a tragic death, to Omnicorp it's a set-back. I was also surprised by its attention to media brainwashing. Showing us news coverage and full screen commercials as if the movie has stopped for a break, suggesting WE need a break to here from their sponsors, like WE need a product fix. The catchphrase \"I'd buy that for a dollar\" is used so much over the course of the film that it becomes  embedded and never goes away. The affect works very well. I've talked quite a lot there about Robocop's intention as a social satire but what about the literal plot that most people remember the film for. Unfortunately in its literal sense, Robocop as a few flaws. Don't get me wrong, Murphy's transition from human to robot is great. The shots are well planned and gripping and Robocop himself looks amazing but it falls pretty flat by the lack of emotion shown by other characters. Murphy's so-called partner Lewis is so wooden that it's hard to believe that in such a short space of time that she has become emotionally involved in Robocop's problems. She is pretty forgettable to be honest. Another real problem with this film is that its action sequences to me are pretty dull.  I honestly don't think they pack any sort of punch to keep anyone interested and unfortunately the soundtrack is awful. Listening to the main theme that has become so iconic over the years made me feel a little embarrassed to the point where it can't really be taken seriously as an 18 certificate action flick. But having said that, Robocop has one of the most disturbing sequences in the history if film involving a vat of acid.  It was a sequence that really disturbed me as a 5 year old boy and the affect has not worn away. It's so relevant to early David Cronenberg body horror images that it feels extremely out of place for a film of this nature. However, this scene alone cannot save Robocop from its bland action moments. So, did I like it? From the many 80's action films that came our way it's definitely the worst I've seen. It tried to take a lot from Terminator and certainly didn't have the grit and horror that James Cameron achieved. On the plus side, Robocop has some really interesting ideas to try and explain where we are as a society and where we are heading. These parts are brilliantly done, I just wish the final product had more meat on the bone so we could watch it for what it is, not for what it was trying to say." "Robocop is by far one of the best sci-fi action movies released in the 1980's. The look of this movie is just astonishing. It has very good visual effects, special effects and there is a lot of violence. This movie is about a police officer who was shot to death by a gang of ruthless criminals and is brought back to life as a half man/half machine named robocop. Hence the films title. Peter Weller was amazing for his role as the lead character. Nancy Allen was outstanding as his partner. In this movie, she is the moral compass. And hands off to Ronny Cox and Kurtwood Smith as the bad guys. This movie is a true classic. It is a must see." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This film is absolutely thrilling on many levels! I always like movies that have cyborgs involved because they do not care about human feelings, they have a program, and their goal is to abide by the program and the rules. This movie has a different twist on that, especially when Robocop starts to remember what happened to him when he was human. This film also has some great villains, and great action involved! The movie has some very violent scenes, so I strongly suggest to get the kids out of the room before watching it because they will more than likely have nightmares especially when one of the villains crashes into a vat of toxic waste! Overall, this movie triumphs as a terrific action film. I think it's message is no matter how much you try to make a man into a machine, you can never terminate someone's mind and emotions! So, give this movie a shot! Long live Robocop!" "This film optimises all the good bits of the 80s. It is ludicrously both violent and funny in places, contains some of the best one liners ever, is set in the future and has a great soundtrack. What more could you ask for! Paul Verhoven was obviously influenced by classics like West World and the film has a really strong good versus evil thread running through it with quite strong religious undertones as well. This is definitely my favourite film of all time and I would highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it. Please bear in mind that there was hardly any CGI used so some of the effects do look a little dated, but that's part of it's charm." "In short, pretty darn well with but a few minor annoyances. For those who never saw it, the name Robocop sounds pretty cheesy but it's nevertheless accurate. It's a mortally wounded normal cop transformed into some kind of cyborg and marketed as the future of law enforcement by a corporation who actually owns the Detroit police. Of course, the corporation wipes out his memories, but the interesting thing is that some start to come back. I found Robocop pretty entertaining and the near future presented here, although not spectacular, shows an interesting satire of society through newscasts and ads. In my memory, there were more ads but the few there are are cynical, darkly humorous and slightly disturbing. Robocop himself is (obviously) rather unemotional but he's cool nevertheless in a deadpan no no-nonsense kinda way. How he deals with each criminal situation is always fun and sometimes surprising. He's slow, methodical, bulletproof and he aims very well. The actions scenes are not frenetic or fast, they're ponderous yet still have impact. The Robocop look is a classic and I don't think it will go out of style. The sound effects and his body movements (especially the head) help sell the mechanical nature of Robocop. I remember this movie having gory disgusting moments and it still has a few, but mostly they're over fast. Anything involving shooting looks painful and it's not glamorized although you'll inwardly cheer whenever Robocop shoots someone because it feels as if they deserve it. That judge-jury-executioner mentality always bugged me in action movies but it bugged me less here. The villains are pretty caricatural but at least they have some personality. The movie tries to make us dislike them, even by showing small despicable acts, and it works. I weirdly wish we had more of those bad guys today instead of the bland cookie-cutter unemotional ones. It's not a movie you watch for the acting as some of it is somewhat over-the-top (looking at you police chief). Yet in the context of this serious satire and since Robocop himself is serious, it blends nicely. Speaking of seriousness, Robocop's actions provide some of the best humour because he's so earnest and clever in his interventions. Despite that, when you think about it, he's a very tragic figure and he has a good character arc. One of the most memorable scenes for me was after his \"accident\" after he's gradually activated, with the cam being Robocop's vision (and us the viewer), intersped with darkness intervals. Two very good echoing memorable scenes are him being shot as a human by criminals (very brutal) and him as a cyborg being shot by law enforcement (nasty and unfair). It makes you fear for him. So, it's been mostly praise up to now but there are a few other things that annoyed me. I liked how the flashbacks were shown but emotionally wise, they didn't grab me as they should have, especially the ones with the kid. I liked how the robot alternative (ED-209) to Robocop looked and it was sometimes quite menacing but it moved too much like stop-motion model animation to me or as part of a miniature set. It looked great at the time but that part didn't age so well. There was also something near the end, that I cannot describe for fear of spoilers, involving a rod that didn't make sense, cheapening the drama. I could guess an explanation but none was offered here either before or after. I think Robocop aged very well. He still looks decent, the humour still amuses, you root for the hero, you hate the bad guys and the story holds up with its twists. Action-wise, I think Robocop's \"slowness\" is an asset rather than a detriment. It makes the action clear and you can anticipate what's coming, making things more satisfying (but still surprising sometimes). Rating: 8 out of 10 (very good)" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Five narrative conflicts in one movie; Man vs. Self, Man vs. Man, Man Vs. Society, Man Vs. Technology, Man Vs. Fate. All in one movie. I am biased to be sure, but RoboCop, is a dramatic movie about grief and loss wrapped up in a shoddy plastic case with flaking gray paint. I watched this the other night again, and even with the ultra violence, the thing that I noticed was how the man became a man, then became a fusion of the two emotionally after he became the machine. Certain things are off in the movie; Murphy's kid is cast too old to properly sympathize with (an 8-10 year old would have been better)and the demographics of Detroit are all wrong, but this is negated by the overall effect. Like the scene where we do not see the steel mill tracheotomy, but the execution of it implies exactly the shock of it, a tight story with great casting, the right rhythm, and the right direction for it's time and place. An extraordinary film; and here are the conflicts; Man vs. Self; Murphy must come to terms with his new self, his reawakened emotions and his inability to go back to the life he once knew. A movie where a man mourns and avenges his own death? Genius. Man vs. Man; Murphy/Robocop vs. Bodiker and Dick Jones, a truly believable duo of villains. Man vs. Society; Robocop loved and hated, an abomination, a Frankenstein, respected and feared but not loved, not human. Can also be Robocop vs. the filth of the city and the corruption of OCP. Man vs. Technology; Now a mechanical man, Robocop fights not only against his new self, but the ED 209s (a wonderful nemesis in it's own right). 'You might not like what you're going to see.' Man vs. Fate; His mission complete, with Clarence Bodiker and Dick Jones taken care of, Robocop becomes resigned to his new role, his new duty, his new self. Love this movie."

"In a dystopian near-future, Police Officer Alex J. Murphy (Peter Weller) is transferred to a rough precinct in downtown Detroit, where he is teamed with tough female cop Anne Lewis (the lovely Nancy Allen). On their first job together, Murphy is gunned down by a vicious gang of criminals, but is rebuilt by corrupt corporate giant OCP who put him back on the streets as RoboCoppart man, part machine, all cop! As a huge fan of Judge Dredd, 2000AD comic's tough lawman of the future, RoboCop was like a dream come true for me when he first came stomping onto the silver screen in 1987. The emotionless lawman wearing a menacing helmet leaving only the lower part of the face visible; the massive handgun; the power of judge, jury and executioner; the use of snappy one-liners ('Your move, Creep': a Dredd-ism if ever there was one): this was Dredd in all but name (only with the benefit of heavy-duty armour plating and a computer for a brain!). Whether script-writer Ed Neumeier and director Paul Verhoeven deliberately channelled the spirit of Judge Dredd into their movie I cannot say for sure, but they certainly captured the essence of the long running comic stripfull of brilliantly realised ultra-violence, satirical swipes at the privatisation of public services, corporate greed and the media, and cool special effects, this is the Dredd film that Sylvester Stallone's debacle never was. Given the choice between the official movie version of the character and RoboCop, I would go with the latter every time. Verhoeven's handling of Neumeier's wonderful script is spot onbrutal, yet touching and wittyand his excellent cast couldn't be better: thanks to training from a mime artist, Peter Weller is utterly convincing as a man turned machine, but also brings a much-needed sense of pathos to his character; the always reliable Allen gives solid support as his spunky partner; Ronny Cox and Kurtwood Smith impress as the film's utterly despicable main bad guys; even the lesser roles are perfect, from ER's Paul McCrane as henchman Emil right down to the guy who would 'buy that for a dollar'! Add snappy editing, a rousing score by Basil Poledouris which helps drive the action forward, plenty of quotable dialogue, and lots of graphic splatter (Verhoeven doesn't hold back on the gore), and what you have is one of the greatest sci-fi/action films of all time. Quite simply, everything about RoboCop works beautifully, like a well oiled piece of precision machinery." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Too bad RoboCop isn't more appreciated. It's really one of the best science-fiction films ever. It could have been just another silly Hollywood product, but in Dutch director Paul Verhoeven's hands it became a thought-provoking and well-crafted critique of American business and culture. OCP (Omni Consumer Products) represents the power of American capitalism. It's a company so wealthy and so powerful that it can reconstruct the entire downtown of the city of Detroit and create a million new jobs. Its two recent products, ED-209 and RoboCop, were made to enforce its plans. ED-209 is a hulk of a robot that can go out of control and kill without consideration. It represents the dark side of American capitalism. RoboCop is a modern knight in shining armour. He's a cyborg who can think, feel and go after the real criminals. He was built by OCP but, because he was the righteous police officer Alex Murphy before, he goes against his creators. In a way, the film is a modern Robin Hood story. Murphy represents Robin Hood while Richard \"Dick\" Jones is Prince John and Clarence Boddicker is the High Sheriff of Nottingham. Jones is the ideal 1980s American businessman. He's aggressive, corrupt, and very much profit-oriented. Robert \"Bob\" Morton on the other hand is younger, a bit wild, and with new ideas. RoboCop is Morton's creation. The cyborg looks fantastic. Peter Weller plays him very well. Just the way he moves is striking. Nancy Allen plays Murphy's pretty partner, officer Anne Lewis. The two remain close even after Murphy becomes RoboCop. The supporting cast is obviously good too, especially the criminals. The four of them are quite the characters. Still, Boddicker easily stands out (Kurtwood Smith wore glasses so that he'd look more like Heinrich Himmler). All the action in the film, though sometimes bloody, is amazing. The music score is another big attraction, fitting the film like a glove. There's plenty of clever humour and corporate criticism. The film's Detroit looks like a futuristic city but also like a decaying one, with crime and poor neighbourhoods. Some reviewers said that the film promotes fascism. The filmmakers denied this, however. In reality RoboCop has socialist messages. There's a lot to like about the film. It's entertaining and it rewards repeat viewings. Director Ken Russell called it the best science-fiction film since Metropolis (1927). RoboCop gets a high recommendation from me." "A cop is brutally murdered in the line of duty only to be resurrected as a robot cop. With a mission to clean up Detroit stopping criminals and corruption unwitting Robocop meets his killers. Social commentary, religious connotations and cutting satire, Paul Verhoeven's Robocop is now over 20 years old, some of the effects have dated and some of the acting is like two-day-old chicken, but it holds up. It is indeed an often-imitated sci-fi classic. It could have been just another Terminator rip-off but all it shared was a machine theme as it had a whole world of its own. That said, it borrows heavily from lesser known films Jean-Claude Lord's The Vindicator and The Wraith both made a year prior. Amongst the rival robot ED-209 and TV commercials what's more interesting about Robocop (played by the now elusive Peter Weller) is the loss of his family and how they have moved on after Alex Murphy's gory death which is only partly explored. There's a lot going on in Edward Neumeier & Michael Miner writing underneath all the action pieces. Miguel Ferrer as 'Bob' is excellent, his performance has all the 80's Wall Street feel of the time, doing whatever it takes to get to the top. Ronny Cox plays 'Dick' Jones and gives the bad guy dimension. It shows a corporate structure and how they also use the underworld to get an immoral job done, in this case using Clarence and his gang played terrifically by Kurtwood Smith. Basil Poledouris' music is fantastic and heightens the films punches and subtleties, the action is great as to are the costumes and practical effects. It is a comic book film for adults but is unusually grounded in a surreal plausibility. It's Orion Pictures fine production, part man, part machine. All cop." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "With its direct-to-video-ready title and decidedly B-movie caliber plot, Robocop really shouldn't be as fantastic as it is. But, by elevating the explosive action sequences with a rather interesting study of science's inability to remove the soul from a human being and some deft satire, this film has actually aged far better than most of its contemporaries. I'm sure most people aren't looking for all that hocus pocus in a film that is more readily billed as a straight, adrenaline-charged action vehicle, so it of course helps that Robocop lives up to the qualifications of this classification with admirable and awesome ease. There are several action set-pieces in this film, most notably the drug lab shootout and the brilliantly realized finale, that live on as scenes that can be watched again and again without losing any of their gravitas. As silly as the idea of Peter Weller stomping out baddies in an intricate metal suit may sound on paper, the seriousness with which the film handles the character of Robocop ensures that we get engrossed enough in his quest for justice that we forget about the logistics of the clunky costume and simply accept it as a feasible creation in the world Paul Verhoeven crafts around it. As an added bonus, the splatter elements are so far beyond anything that had been seen in a mainstream action picture at the time (trust me, I was there), that the violence functions as both over-the-top thrills and as a potent set-up for Robocop's eventual revenge mission. You can't help but feel for poor Murphy when he meets his fate in an early sequence that set a new standard for brutality. On this front, fans of the crimson sauce will be well-advised to seek out the Criterion Collection DVD, which reinstates some cut gore that adds even more weight (as if it were needed) to Murphy's brutal execution, and lets us get a longer glimpse of the firepower of ED-209 as he shreds a hapless executive to ribbons. Weller is very strong in the title role, despite the mechanical nature of his character, and the human element is never too far removed from the robotic creation he has become. The cast is augmented by a slew of brilliant character actors, all of whom you will immediately recognize from several prominent films and television shows. An especially strong turn by Nancy Allen, who is a lot of fun to watch as she holds her own with the high-caliber actors and firepower around her, makes me wonder why I can't readily remember seeing her in ANY other movies (it's also telling that she doesn't even have a picture on her IMDb listing). Allen doesn't strike the viewer as a leading lady, but her nimble handling of material that could be ridiculous in the wrong hands makes it quite amazing that she didn't go on to equally prominent roles. The humor elements are well-restrained and brought in to serve the film, not dominate it. Our titular law enforcement titan doesn't crack a one-liner every time he shoots a bad guy, which was refreshing in 1987, and still is today. Even if we get to laugh a bit throughout, none of the jokes derail the forward momentum of the action, and certainly the grim violence offsets any hint of this film being a camp movie. Though not quite a masterpiece, Robocop has all the elements of a great action movie, and plenty more elements that most genre films of the era didn't have the intelligence to ponder. It's hard to imagine anyone who knows what this film is being disappointed. Highly recommended." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This excellent action, thriller fits into a category or genre that I have dubbed Comic Book Films. In these films the action is tense and furious, the death count unusually high and a little imagination is required of the viewer. RoboCop is even more as it has a high level of satire to spice things up. Paul Verhoeven is one the originators of this genre and one its finest directors. He keeps the pace really moving, adds touches of humor in just the right spots, and he gets the best out of his casts and crews. RoboCop is the perfect example. Peter Weller is perfection as Alex Murphy / RoboCop, giving heart and character to a robot/cyborg and proving he's up to the action as well. Nancy Allen is excellent as his compassionate partner, Officer Anne Lewis. The film has a trio of great villains led by Kurtwood Smith at his nastiest, vilest best, Miguel Ferrer as the sleazy creator of RoboCop, and Ronny Cox as a creepy, despicable CEO of OCP. Dan O'Herlihy adds class as \"The Old Man\". The score, by the great Basil Poledouris, is fabulous and complements the movie. I highly recommend \"RoboCop\" to anyone who enjoys a terrific action film!" "Satire, Comedy, 'over-the-top' violence and emotion is executed with perfection in this movie. 'RoboCop' is the story of police officer; Alex Murphy, who is brutally massacred by a vicious group of criminals. Murphy is then chosen to be the subject of the \"RoboCop project\" prototype, which is an operation that assembles dead policemen into cyborgs. A part-man, part-machine incarnation of Murphy, now called; RoboCop, rides through the old streets of Detroit, fighting crime as a robot police man. RoboCop slowly finds out what happened to Alex Murphy and learns that he was Murphy before his reincarnation as a Cyborg. RoboCop then sets out to get revenge for himself by going after the killers. I first watched this film when I was 7, and I became a 'Robo-fan' instantly after seeing it. To me it was a bad-ass film about a Robot-police man kicking ass in the most vicious way however, when I watch it now, it is more than that. It is a powerful picture about humanity and all its values. The action scenes are incredible and the reflection of 1980's America is done disturbingly well by director; Paul Verhoeven (A legend of his time). I give it 10 stars. Thank You for reading." "Sharp, biting, relentless and over-the-top. I dig it! Paul Verhoeven's high-tech Sci-fi masterpiece 'Robocop' truly stands the test of time, and I don't see it falling from its pedestal anytime soon. Exceptional film-making, and the pride shows in the finished product. Verhoeven' slick and sleek tailoring blends superbly with Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner's furiously lethal, but smartly witty material. You got to have memorable villains, and 'Robocop is no exception. Ronny Cox (corrupt corporate power) and Kurtwood Smith (maniac criminal) are brilliant in their roles, and they're matched up by Peter Weller's perfectly humane performance as Robocop. He emotionally engages. Miguel Ferrer's turn has a lively sting as the man behind the creation and Ray Wise is good. However Nancy Allen is rather ho-hum, acceptable but nothing that stands out really she's bland. The characters are very well-drawn up. Now the special effects. Outstanding and inspired! This is what I miss, and the execution is barnstorming. The stop-motion ED209 design looks great and the metallic creation RoboCop himself is magnetically achieved with the clash between the two being heart-racing experience. As for the action, it comes in spades. Verhoeven drills in the scorching suspense and punishing violence with ease, and this heavy-handed style works due to its gusty premise. Basil Poledouris' score pounds away, but manages a majestic vibe that simply soars. Satire, violence and profanity done in an unapologetic manner by being swirled in to a wicked sense of dark humour and unstoppable energy. Imaginative, powerful and evocative entertainment." "Officer Murphy arises from the dead as a robotic cop who is about to kick some criminal butt... It sounds pretty corny, and it is pretty corny, but it's a pretty great ride while it lasts. As soon as you see the special effects, you know you're in an 80s movie, but that's what makes this so lovable. The action is a little cheesy at times and some of the lines are pretty lame, but if you decide to watch this movie because you want to see the Ironman of 20 years ago, you've made a mistake. This movie knows what it is and doesn't try to be anything more. It has some pretty entertaining fight scenes and the whole concept of a robotic cop is pretty much all this needs. Sure, if this movie was made in 2008 it would be a bit pathetic, but as 80s action goes, this is pretty great." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "I must have been about eleven when i first saw Robocop, the version i had seen on TV was so extremely censored that i was asking myself: why did he die? The damage done to him, didn't looked that serious. As a child, i liked the movie mainly for the effects and robots, but the more i grew up, the more my perception of this movie widened itself and yet there was a shock to come. About ten years later i bought the criterion DVD of Robocop and still i knew nothing, also i had seen Starship Troopers and knew as well as had seen about Verhovens, let's say addiction to movie violence and extreme gore, but still... \"Nana nanana, nana nanana!\" Boom! And off Murphys hand flew, i felt like someone had kicked me in the stomach with full throttle, i truly felt like witnessing an accident or violent crime. I will not give away the full horror of Murphys death, but i have to say, i am not a wuss when it comes to movie violence, but this scene repeated itself in my head as well as willing and unwilling for the next two weeks! The unedited scene with Kinney in the boardroom was already quite unsettling, but you still could laugh, well it was a sick but yet still desperate laugh, there was still something funny about it, but when it came to the full Monty in this scene, oh boy! I couldn't believe that they where laughing at him and making jokes, so sick and depraved, it is hard to believe, but sometimes humans can be so cruel to each other, you just have to watch the news to find out, that this is sadly but quite common, in one form or the other. But if you really keep your focus on the story, you can experience something wonderful, despite all the vile and cruel images. This movie is so much: Satire, Comedy, Science-Fiction, even Horror! But most important it is a great drama! Most people i know, have never seen the original Robocop, they only saw the sequels or the TV shows, or they just oversaw the movie, as what it is. I more or less forced some of my friends to watch Robocop in it's unedited form and all of them where more or less shocked about Murphys death scene, but all told me in the end how wrong they where prejudging or misunderstanding the movie and they all said, that this is a great classic and unsettling drama. It is disguised though, but if you strip Robocop of all the robots and cyborgs, all the guns and drugs, all the corporative slime-bags and thugs, what you then have is a drama and a great one too! It is about the loss of identity, about the value of life, it shows how fragile we are and that we can die any second and that all we take for granted can vanish in an instant! As Verhoven mentioned himself Robocop is about the paradise lost, something you remember, but never can return to. I restrain my self now, because there is so much more to say about this movie, some things probably said, but if you want to see a great action film, a right in your face satire, if you like robots and cool old school stop-motion, if you like extreme bloody violence and if you have a strong stomach, then i only can recommend Robocop! I could write more about this movie, as many others did and could, but you really should see it for your self! Ignore the flaws of this classic and focus on what is important: The drama of Alex J. Murphy!!! And you will see and this is guaranteed a fantastic movie!!!" "Because there is not only a lot of humor in RoboCop, but a lot of hilarious, off-the-wall, goofy black humor extracted from the idea of a ruthless, callous dystopian future in a movie that gives the impression of a grim action thriller, it plunks us out of auto-pilot. We're not entirely certain where the film is going, and that's one of any movie's greatest features. It is Detroit in the future, where violent crime is unmanageable, perhaps because the city is in an economic shambles. The city hires the ubercorporation OCP to sponsor and control the police department, but OCP is not concerned with replenishing the city but instead changing it to an up-to-the-minute utopia. So, they intend to end crime in the city with an already inundated police department. Ronny Cox, the second highest echelon in the conglomerate, introduces a new cop robot called ED-209, which should end the crime in the city. An unrehearsed presentation goes wrong when ED-209 doesn't see that a volunteer has dropped his gun as commanded and unloads on him. A cocky lower employee played by Miguel Ferrer propositions the RoboCop program. Peter Weller plays Murphy, a cop newly transfered to another precinct, soon fatally wounded, to say the very very very least, in action by a vicious gang of villains led by a notorious mastermind played fantastically by Kurtwood Smith, and pronounced dead in the hospital. His brain and face, however, (I can hear you laughing) are used for a robot and he becomes RoboCop, patrolling the city with an extremely effective brand of crimefighting. The rough skeleton of the scenario grows by the side of relatively customary action- adventure outline. But this is not a customary action adventure. Paul Verhoeven, the exceptional Dutch filmmaker is never clearly pigeonholed. There is broad comedy in this movie, and a sure quantity of philosophy, resting on the ponderance of what necessitates a human being. One of those pop culture philosophy books should be written about the RoboCop character and universe, definitely. And there is sharp satire, too. Taking into account that he spends most of his on-screen time behind makeup devices or RoboCop's alloy cowl and visor, Peter Weller is clever in his manner of emoting through stoicism. Nancy Allen is great, and not just a token sexy lady role, Ronny Cox is a great villain, so hateful, and the film's music score is actually quite infectiously memorable. This is one of my guilty favorites."

"RoboCop is a rather classic yet kind of underrated Sci-Fi/Action gem of the 1980's. The film offered plenty of violence, satire and action and the film definitely delivered all three elements. The story is simple, a police officer gets killed in the line of duty by a crime gang but is resurrected as a Half-Man, Half-Machine officer nicknamed RoboCop. Of course, there's more to that story than it sounds. Sure, it sounds cheesy but believe me, it's more than that. Aside from the satire, the film also shows his distraught and sadness over the loss of his humanity and the loss of his family. The acting is great. Nobody could play Alex Murphy/RoboCop better than Peter Weller, he was born to play the character. Nanyc Allen played her role well, Ronny Cox and Kurtwood Smith played really great assholes and their characters also became one of my all time favorite villains. There's a lot of gore in the unrated cut to please fellow gore fiends like myself. The script is really good and Paul Verhoeven handled his direction of the film like a champ, it is that good. Barely any nitpicks. Overall, 10 out of 10 from me." "We are all screwed... well, if you live in Detroit you are. I saw Robocop in the theaters as a 10 year old kid and watched adults leave in disgust and shock while a married couple argued because she wanted to leave and he didn't by the film's halfway point. Awesome! As an adult, I've come to see the lines that separate genres of film internally. Sci-Fi is vast, many of the stories being in the future (Star Trek/Bladerunner) or futuristic (Star Wars/Last Starfighter)... then there is the 'UltraViolent' segment (see Clockwork Orange/Mad Max). RoboCop blurred the lines between most if just slightly. Easily one of Verhoven's best works this film was a huge surprise hit. Not starring anyone in particular but great turns by Weller and Kurtwood Smith it hit home like a grenade you stare at but are too afraid to run from before it kills you. The film, laced with social messages and glaring examples of yesterday's, today's and what were in deed tomorrow's problems did so with gusto and humor while giving you an example of Frankenstien's wet dream in modern technology. Upfront, in your face and riding the wave of Reaganomics, escalating drugs and domestic urban violence the film slaps you with all the sad truths of society with a slightly angry but honest view. If you can see the unrated version, do so. After all, does some extra bullets and blood and guts and brain matter really get offensive at this point? Not just a violent disturbing Sci-Fi film, one of the most surprising social conscience films you'll find. Sci-Fi epic... no bathroom breaks!" "With \"RoboCop\" director Paul Verhoeven and writers Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner brought one of the most memorable sci-fi characters of movie history to the big screen. Three years after the first \"Terminator\"-movie they created another cyborg to behold and although nerdy fanboys have often compared the two and computer games have been made where one battles the other, \"RoboCop\" is an entirely different beast than James Cameron's action/adventure. First and foremost Verhoeven's movie is a satire. A satire on themedia and the American way of life in the 80's during the Regan era. The violence in this film is so over the top it can hardly be taken serious. The news snippets that are strewn in between are little comedic sketches. I remember watching \"RoboCop\" as a child and not getting any of this. To me it was just a badass character at the time. And, of course, the movie still works that way, too. The set design is just awesome. Detroit looks run down and rotten. Every scenery is drenched in gray. That doesn't make the movie a downer, though. It just underlines the fact that law and order doesn't play a major role in this Detroit of the not too distant future. The clumsy (then: state-of-the-art) stop motion-special effects are charming and make one of RoboCop's opponents, the evil (or rather disturbed) robot ED-209 seem much more threatening than any modern CGI would. Finally, I have to mention the violence again. I don't think a big budget movie has gotten down to the nitty-gritty before or ever since. Verhoeven is just mad and one the loose. It's a delight. Not even the spectacular (in terms of body count and f/x) sequel could keep up with the bloodshed of its predecessor. \"RoboCop\" really grows on you, and if it may seem a bit dowdy through the cynical eyes of a grown up living in the 21st century, watch the movie again. And again. And again. Then you will start to feel like a child again watching this for the first time. You will fall in love with scenes like the classic Toxic Waste-incident or the classic \"Dick, you're fired!\"-moment. They just don't make balls to the wall-action movies like this one anymore. Bet'cha that the planned remake of \"RoboCop\" will not better this near masterpiece in any way." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Robocop is essentially two very important genres. In one aspect Robocop is superhero film for adults...a big R rating slapped on it. But it fits the genre. It shows the tragic event that creates the hero, it shows the hero busting random crime, and it shows the rise of a villain to face the hero. The cool thing about Robocop being a superhero film is that it was an original idea and not based on a comic book hero or already established story. Secondly Robocop is a prime example of the eighties action genre which is such an important genre that spawned Die Hard, Rambo, Terminator and every Schwarzenegger film made in his early career. Notoriously R Rated explode fests, blood soaked, four letter words ever and usually token nude scenes from big breasted ladies. Granted Robocop doesn't have any nude scenes remarkably but everything else it hits the mark on in a big way. But Robocop goes beyond both of these genres to really create something incredible that has kept the series going, bad or good in one way or another, for the last 2 decades. Creator and writer Edward Neumeier created this darkly comedic spoof on a future world complete with very tongue in cheek commercials and news reports that make you laugh and think at the same time. It doesn't take away from the film but yet gives the movie a certain edge. Despite seemingly being a last choice for the role Peter Weller turns in a very good performance. He carries the film just as well as any big name eighties actor could have done. Granted most of his acting is from inside the massive suit but that's even more of a challenge because he has to play droning and robotic but still have this emotional side that makes Robocop more than just an action flick and Weller definitely delivers in the role. Nancy Allen is terrific but I think very underused as Murphy's/Robocop's partner. She has this laid back quality to her character and yet she is honest and a strong female partner to Robocop. Ronny Cox is also terrific as Dick Jones, the corrupted senior partner in OCP, the company determined to take over the city any means necessary. Cox is the perfect adversary to Robocop and is the quintessential eighties villain. Miguel Ferrer is also great in a small role as the slimy Bob Morton who created Robocop to undermine Jones' ideas to take over the city. Finally Kurtwood Smith (yep Red Forman himself) is the insanely evil and unbalanced Clarence Boddicker. Boddicker is one of my favorite movie villains because he's completely nuts and the perfect bad guy. I would have loved to have seen him come back in future sequels. In many ways, and maybe it's because the current state of CGI and special effects but Robocop can seem very cheesy and yet at the same time the special effects are incredible. The film was nominated for three Academy Awards in editing and sound. Even the dialog and one liners seem campy but you never really notice it because you become so involved in this futuristic, dark, gritty world with this strange hero that you will be fascinated with. Robocop is an ultimate eighties classic no matter what bad rap it got for continuing in a less than stellar fashion. Over the next month or so I'm going to watch and review every piece of live action Robocop (3 movies, TV Series, and the fourth made for TV installment.) All of this is because I am enamored with the original. It's action packed, great performances, and an all around amazing sci-fi, action hero, film. SEE IT NOW!! 9/10" "A great sci-fi actioner, Robocop offers a bleak vision of a dystopian future by fusing together brutal excessive violence and clever social satire, taking a swipe at big-money corporations and incompetent cops. Paul Verhoeven shows that awareness of the growing interest in contemporary technological advancement is the only way to avoid moral and economic collapse in a crime-riddled society. To achieve this urban pacification a cyborg, Robocop, is created to violently dispose of crime and also corruption in near-future Detriot. Verhoeven uses graphic comic-book violence and sadistic scenes of brutal action to startling and sometimes comedic effect (the latter becoming apparent only after several viewings!). It has a great selection of classic action scenes everywhere. From the brutally dark and disturbing mauling of Murphy to the gross-out but funny sequences involving an OCP exec getting completely mullered by the faulty original law-enforcement design ED-209 (\"Somebody wanna call a goddamn paramedic!\") and a gang member falling into a vat of Toxic waste and then with his skin melting off getting decapitated on the front windscreen of a car! Over-the-top, disturbingly violent, hilarious and brilliantly made. 8/10" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Sometimes I think the 1980s is an underrated decade for movies. While it can't boast as many influential films as the early 1970s classics made by young prodigies, or the high-concept, gimmicky, technically superior films of the 90s or 2000s, the 80s can certainly be regarded as 'The Entertainment Decade'. Most movies of the 80s were fun! And ROBOCOP is much more than that. Whatever the message of ROBOCOP is (or not), it is totally entertaining, from beginning to end. At its bare bones, ROBOCOP is a good-versus-evil action drama of cops against criminals. At that level alone, it accomplishes a lot. It has great, gritty, technically executed action scenes w/o a lot of (if any) special effects. In terms of the real cops in this film and the street criminals, there is a clear delineation of good and evil. Cops: good. Criminals: bad. But underneath the surface, as I'm certain has been alluded to ad nauseaum, ROBOCOP, intentionally or unintentionally, is about more than good against evil, at least 'obvious' good (earnest, hard-working cops) against 'obvious' evil (blatant crime). The film is very prophetic. The scenes of news anchors switching between broadcasting technological advancements and violent crimes is eerily similar to what is going on today. Of course, there's the societal theme of the correlation between increasing technology and increased misuse of it, and that while technology advances, people seem to stay stagnant or to even regress in behavior. The biggest prophecy of ROBOCOP is of corporate greed and how corporations have been outsourced to take over things that should be handled by the government (law enforcement in this film). And by taking over, these corporations corrupt the core tenets of these institutions (today it is military) But in taking over these institutions, the corporations don't necessarily corrupt the 'soldier' of the institution, the cop in this film. And with all of that analysis above in what sounds like the description of a boring movie, ROBOCOP is still hugely entertaining. The basic story is that an ordinary, everyday Detroit beat cop Officer Alex Murphy (played by Peter Weller, more on him later) with wife and child, is on duty one day with his partner Officer Anne Lewis (well-played by Nancy Allen) and they try to arrest a bunch of experienced street thugs, but they fail and Murphy is brutally murdered by the thugs, led by Clarence Boddicker (played by Kurtwood Smith in a confident, lean performance). This scene was very brutal for 1987, and still disturbs. Boddicker delivers the fatal shot to Murphy in the head, then the film immediately cuts to a sequence of well-executed scenes of the ensuing months where Murphy is airlifted to the hospital, operated on, and transformed into ROBOCOP. In charge of all of this is corporate exec Bob Morton (played by Miguel Ferrer in the best performance of his career). Morton works for OCP, who have been 'outsourced' to run the Detroit police department. Robocop is Morton's brain-child of the perfect cop who can fight all crime and can't be stopped. And early on, Robocop can't be stopped. We get the obligatory scenes of Robocop fighting various crimes (grocery store robbery, a rape, a kidnapping) and get a taste of his technological (and human) abilities (built-in eye monitor to see from long range, assessing a situation to choose the best course of action, a targeting system to shoot with accuracy). All these scenes tie together nicely and are taut, suspenseful, and even funny. But something happens. Robocop starts to have the memories of his alter-ego Murphy and actually begins to 'think' for himself. He investigates Murphy's past life and finds out that he had wife, child, and was brutally murdered and proceeds to bring down the criminals who killed him. This is where my discussion of Peter Weller's performance comes in. This is not just a guy in a robot suit spouting off lines in a monotone manner. This is a fully convincing performance of a half-man, half-machine with remarkable abilities, but still with human thoughts, emotions, and instincts under the surface. And Weller pulls it off amazingly. There's not a false note in this performance. As Robocop starts to think for himself and bring down the criminals, Morton's boss at OCP Dick Jones (played by Ronny Cox in a totally convincing performance as a corrupt corporate big-wig) conspires with gang leader Boddicker to conversely bring down Morton and Robocop. And it is this sequence of events that makes the viewer begin to see the complexity in all the major villains (Morton is overly ambitious and a jerk, but he isn't lethal like Jones; Boddicker is a sleazy killer thug, but what does this make Jones, who arms Boddicker with the resources to take down Robocop? Jones is vengeful, but Morton forced him into it by disrespecting his position at OCP). Needless to say, it all comes down to a thrilling climax as Robocop, having been battered and bruised by Jones' own Robot 'cop' ED209 (a overly big, clunky, easily-fooled monstrosity), with a big time assist from Officer Lewis, has the big showdown with Boddicker and his gang at a steel mill. These final action scenes are exciting, with virtually no special effects, just lean, mean, clean action, done the old-fashioned way. The film has all the elements that any great action film should have: a sound story, action scenes with mounting tension and great set pieces (a la the gas station scene, my favorite of the film) and great choreography (the warehouse shootout, a beautifully executed scene), solid acting, a witty screenplay, memorable score, and great direction (by Paul Verhoeven, his best work IMHO). So what is ROBOCOP? Action flick? Sci-fi fantasy? Social satire? Prophetic vision of the future? I say all of the above. And you can add to that SHEER ENTERTAINMENT!" "I just watched Robocop for the first and was surprised at how much I liked it. I was really expecting a cheesy 80's flick with nothing else going for it but it's much more than that. I was thoroughly entertained the entire way through because it moves very well. I'm just disappointed that I waited so incredible long to finally see it. The acting is great, I really enjoyed Peter Weller and Nancy Allen and I felt like Weller did a great job of transforming his character into Robocop. The story is interesting and well written with some truly memorable scenes. What stands out most to me is probably the gore and special effects, they truly blew me away. I think this is a new favorite of mine. If you like Sci-fi/Action movies, this one is for you. I can almost guarantee that it will entertain you the entire way through. But seriously, stop reading this and watch it already!" "This movie is really unique in how it is done. It has also stood the test of time. Sure, Terminator movies are more popular, but RoboCop should be as popular, if not more popular than what people think. RoboCop has a more structured storyline to it than that of Terminator. Plus the character design is way cooler. The movie itself has great acting and there are many memorable catch phrases like \"Stay out of trouble\" and \"dead or alive your're coming with me\". The movie shows the plight of Detroit and the rise of crime. Thus, a man is built into a wrecking machine and gets sweet revenge on those who made him into what he is. I hope they revive this franchise someday. It deserves to be revived." "Paul Verhoeven is one of my favorite directors for the matter of how he makes almost all of his films action-packed but also seem like you're just watching T.V. at home. Robocop is no exception in what could easily be considered his action/sci-fi classic. In case you don't know the story here's how it works: an outstanding rookie known as Alex Murphy is brought into a new police department to crackdown on some dealers. Obviously, it doesn't end too well and the dealers capture Murphy and blast him to bits. Somehow, Murphy is rescued with the little life he has hanging on and transforms him into a cyborg that we now know as Robocop, the ultimate crime-fighting figure. The movie is fun to watch with exquisite visual effects for a film done in the eighties. The action is great, the storyline though somewhat cheesy remains entertaining and you only wish that the sequels were half as good." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "On paper, this movie has the appeal of a low budget movie. On screen, this movie just works. Robocop is a very popular science fiction movie that has developed a large fan following. In an unspecified time in the future, a newly transferred police officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is gunned down by a gang of thugs, led by Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith). Around the same time, Omni Consomer Products (OCP), takes control of the Detroit Police Department. A young executive Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer) leads the Robocop project of creating a 24 hour police officer to combat the crime problem in Detroit. While Robocop has been a success, Murphy's old memories surface and Murphy/Robocop seeks revenge against Boddicker and his gang. Robocop is assisted by his ex-partner Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen). At the same time, Robocop also uncovers corruption within OCP. There is a lot of satire and humour in this movie, which relates to real life. This is not just a straightforward sci-fi action movie, this is a very original and intelligent movie. It contains a lot of violence and gore, but this is what makes Robocop popular. It's a shame most of these actors have not gone on to do bigger and better things, particularly Peter Weller. Robocop 2 was good but not great, it seemed to focus on action and sadistic ultra violence, and the humour was lacking. Robocop 3 was largely disappointing and killed the franchise, as it seemed to appeal to younger audiences, making it less violent and completely removing all the foul language. The original Robocop is, and still is, the best movie in the series and as a sci-fi movie. 10/10."

"RoboCop - This is one of my favourite alltime films, and after seeing this last night, remains so. This is what film makers need to be looking at... even though it's a shallow Sci Fi movie, it's got more emotion in the characters (of which is a superb supporting cast)... incredible effects... Rob Bottin designing Robo is up there with Winston for Predator and Giger for Alien... it's that good. The musci by Basil Poulderis is simply perfect and with the set piece in the cocaine factory creates one of the greatest shootouts in cinema history with stunning choreography on Robo. Simply put this is one of not only the greatest bunch of Sci Fi films ever... it's one of THE best films ever. Well done Verhoven! 10/10" "This film to me has not dated -= in fact the frightening thing is that it echoes what is happening now - from news readers smiling about commercials for the 'SUX' and then shooting to the next story about '300 deaths in central America' (pp)... We even have police officers threatening to strike in the u|k at the moment!! But the film is also so quotable and there are very strong performances - esp from Kurtwood smith \"Can you fly bobby!\" The action scenes are spot on and the violent is very violent - which it should be... the other main star of this is Basil poledouris's music - it is fab and drives the films action and emotive scenes!! Rock on robo!!!" "Robocop deserve better audience then it did it was a fun movie , a misunderstood hero . Peter Weller was great as Robocop , the directing was near perfect , settings was fantastic , since everyone is doing make overs as it were , Battlestar Galactica , Star Trek ; anyone listening out there? A new Robocop ? We need more heroes these days . why not a new Robocop ? Peter Jackson would you do it? Everybody was great , the best . in Robocop . Good job ,well done . Rkallao. Why not Dean Cain as Robocop ? He has the built just like Peter Weller did , but Dean is a lot younger then when Peter did it , imagine what Dean Cain could do as Robocop ?" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Brilliant, Robocop changed an audience's view of action/sci-fi films! Even the storyline of Robocop is engaging, the Detroit police force incapable of stemming crime in the city turn to their city sponsors, OCP (Omni Consumer Products)to find a solution. Their solution to revive a dead cop called Murphy and turn him into an unstoppable machine, who serves the public trust and protects the innocent! The action of the film also caught people's attention, even though to some it was too extreme! I didn't think that! Robocop keeps you watching even when you begin to tire of the action scenes of Robocop stopping a criminal, the constant aroma of techno science-fiction never ceases to amaze me and other watchers!" "A lot of compliments can be paid to such a movie. It really follows no genre, and the writers and director made their own rules. This is action packed, humor packed, coolness packed, emotion packed sizzle! It follows several factions. One is Detroit's bankrupt and fading police force who can't even help when one cop, Murphy, is brutally murdered by a second faction, a group of engaging and amusing deliciously evil bad guys who will make you hate them and laugh with them at the same time. A third faction, a super large corporation of bigwig Bill Gates types who run the city, create the new mechanized crime fighter. But there again, we have some outstanding, yet at the same time, hilarious, conflict. There are scenes involving the bloodsucking members of the corporation that are classic. In fact there are classic scenes throughout this movie in every little frame. A man wets his own pants trying to escape a bathroom. A genial kindly old man witnesses a fellow board member being gunned down mercilessly and tells the man responsible \"I am very disappointed.\" There are little commercials and bits which the characters watch on TV that add spice. The language is harsh, but hilarious and needed for this type of movie. In the toned down version, the leader of the bad guys storms into a room and says \"Ladies leave!\" Huh? The original was much more effective. Try to get the uncensored version for the full effect." "Its a dark time in Detroit. Crime overrules the city. Meanwhile, OCP buys the police force and starts experimenting around with robots. Then they create ROBOCOP. Hes indestructible, unstoppable, and furious. Besides being a robot, he starts having flashbacks about his past. Excellent movie, well worth watching. Phil Tippit's amazing ED-209 really makes the movie. Smart script, action and occasional humor spin into one. WARNING: This is an incredibly violent picture. But its still good. Hey! Its got Red from 'That 70's Show' in it, how can you go wrong? Script: 20 (30%) Acting: 35 (40%) Effects: 20(20%) Music: 10 (10%) ----- 85% = 9" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This is an awesome film. The acting is awesome and very believable. I've seen both the unrated and the R rated version of the film and the unrated version is better, in which Alex Murphy's death is more violent (which can be a good thing). Kurtwood Smith, did a fabulous job as Clarence, the crime lord of Detroit. Peter Weller did a fabulous job as Alex Murphy and Robocop, especially when trying to find out who he was before he became Robocop. The special effects are very good, considering the time when this film was made. If you enjoy sci-fi films, action films, or movies with lots of violence, then this movie is for you." "They don't make them like this anymore! A classic of the genre, Robocop is shocking, violent, but an absolutely compelling film. A film like this could never be made in the present-day politically correct environment, and I don't believe that is a good thing. Robocop is a frightening insight into a dystopian future where large corporations run rough shod over society, completely devoid of benevolence, a profit is far more important to them than social cohesion and even human life. Unrealistic? I don't think so, especially not in a country like the USA. Some of the violence is extremely gratuitous, particularly Murphy's murder and the ED209 massacre, but the movie wouldn't be the same without it. That said, I wouldn't recommend this movie for children. The media reporting of Casey Wong I thought was brilliant, as well as the advertisements. Fantastic satire on consumer culture and where we might be headed. Acting was first rate, particularly Dick Jones and Clarence Boddicker, wow, these guys were brilliant. Although the special effects are clearly outdated, particularly with ED209 scenes, this movie has truly stood the test of time. After nearly 20 years Robocop is still far superior to the nonsense action movies put out today which might contain flashy special effects but fail to capture anything like the suspense and power of this film. As stated earlier, truly one of the best of its genre: Brilliant movie, I give it 9 out of 10 stars" "Having seen this movie about 10 years ago it seems that quite a few things about the story have either come true or could possibly come true maybe 10 years down the road. Although not mentioned in this movie (the worst drug imaginable \"nuke\" was prevalent in Robocop 2, there is quite a bit of drug referencing and could be referring to our problems today with \"ice\". This film is extremely violent but it is a foretaste of what life will be like in the near future. It was good to see that there is still a \"human\" element to Robocop. The writer realizes that you still need some compassion and empathy even in technology. If you don't, you might end up with a situation like the one in this trilogy, or worse you could be staring down the barrel of the \"Terminator\" scenario. This movie has some great acting and the company in the movie reminds us of quite a few companies which will remain nameless to avoid lawsuits." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "If you haven't already seen this movie, do yourself a favour. Sit down with an open mind and remember that it's not just another shallow 80's gun-fest, but rather a fantastic deeply funny satire. And while it is very funny, and excessively violent, there is a lot of emotional weight behind it that drives the story forward. Robocop is a great movie that works on so many levels and can be viewed in any number of ways. It's got satire, sci-fi, ultra-violence, rich imagery, great acting, black comedy, heart... I love this film and it's as relevant today as it was back in 87. Peter Weller does a great job and by putting such an actor in the lead role is just one of the many elements that makes this film so much more than violent sci-fi hokum. Paul Verhoeven directs brilliantly. This movie comments on everything from America's love affair with violence and justice, to the danger of society ruled by \"big business\". Robocop really deserves to be ranked alongside the likes of The Terminator and Blade Runner. Not to be missed."

"classic sci fi movie. In my mind, the best sci fi movie there is. It is great on all fronts: acting, directing, storytelling, script, action, pacing. From the news flashes and goofy commercials to the graphic violence and graphic language, this was a head turning cult hit. The real treat here were the bad guys in the movie, they were real sinister and evil. Kurtwood Smith will always be Clairence to me, I don't give a damn if he was in 'That 70s Show' and Ronny Cox was just as good a villain too. RoboCop has some sharp action for its time but it was also emotional on many levels. When Murphy gets killed in the warehouse, it was so violent and butchering that it made you that much more of a fan of RoboCop through the movie as he really just goes and picks off each of the goons that killed him earlier. Some good twist and turns, many story lines through the movie that fell into place very smoothly. It produced 2 other sequels but nothing nearly as good as this one. A real gem. They don't make movies like this anymore, its a real shame." "Although on the surface, a good guys vs bad guys flick, this movie exists at several levels at once. Sci\\fi, comedy, action etc.... However, I believe that this is a story about a man who is on a search for his very being. HAving been reduced to a machine, he spends the entire movie trying to find out who he is. The answer to \" Good shooting son, what's your name?\", is the penultimate moment. This is why Robocop 2 ehhh and rebook 3 yuck, were uneeded. The action flick nature of Robocop is a vehicle for Murphy's rediscovery. Murphy is never intended to be a superhero. Great movie, and an example of where they should have \"left good enough alone\"" "Robocop is an exceptional film, it combines the themes of a comedy, sci-fi, action, and even moments which leave you feeling sorry for characters in the movie, personally i love it how the society in which the movie is based-on is modelled by a corporate domination of both civil rights and public authority, robocop is a kind of 'final-solution' to inhibit the people of this society from plunging into total-anarchy, and the evil-minded yet calm and bipolar corporate bosses are willing to use any magnitude of force to stop an uprising from the people. This film will bring any new viewer extreme excitement, and laughter, it has it's fair share of brutally explicit slaughter scenes, but that's half of the fun." "RoboCop is just about as close as you can get to the perfect sci-fi action movie. With Paul Verhoeven behind it, RoboCop gives us a gritty and depressing look at a violent future. Speaking of violence, this is an ultra-violent film that is not for the squeamish. Blood, guts, and body parts fly in all directions, which is what we've come to expect from Mr. Verhoeven. The action sequences are wonderfully over-the-top. You couldn't ask for any more huge explosions, intense car crashes, or crackling shootouts (all about the shootout at the cocaine factory). Peter Weller is perfect as RoboCop. No one could've played him better. And that's final. Ronny Cox and Kurtwood Smith are excellent as the villains...you just can't wait for them to get stabbed in the neck. The score is one of the most memorable in movie history and you will be humming it for days. The cinematography is top-notch as well. To sum up: great action, great story, great music, GREAT FUN! You go Robo!" "Verhoeven has made an ultra violent movie that plays out before your eyes like a smooth ride. The script tells of a near-future society where violence and power rules and big-government and media has taken over and might even have fused. They need a miracle to stomp out the violence and create order, and to do that they take the body of a slain cop hero and turn him into Robocop. But something remains of the human that used to be Murphy, and as it turns out this element is enough for Robocop to turn against his creators and get to the real roots of the problems. The bad guys have no redeeming qualities and are dispatched off in the worst ways. How does a bath in toxic waste sound like? This movie also has none of the American patriotism and what-not. Paul Verhoeven is a Dutchman, and has no sympathies in any of those directions. It is just an ultra violent near-future version of the world as we know it. This movie is a comedy, but it is not easy to spot it. That is one of the things that makes it so good." "\"RoboCop\" is your average graphic comic book brought to life.The characters act like the kind of characters you may find in a graphic comic book.The setting of the film is urban,futuristic and grim.Set in Detroit,1997,Peter Weller is a cop who is killed in the line of duty and is then transformed in to a crime fighting machine by a corrupt corporation.This film does have its moments in terms of violence and action.\"RoboCop\" is a riot and a lot of fun to watch.This is the best film of 1987.And as I said before,the most violent of 1987. Revenge is told with such glee in this film and the special effects are amazing.The power of \"RoboCop\" not only comes from its violence or visual effects,but from its look of a futuristic detroit.I was 16 when I had seen this film back in 1988 and I was deeply effected by this film.It's not that often that you will come up upon a film like \"RoboCop\"." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "I first watched RoboCop at a very young age. At the time, I loved it, because of the fact that RoboCop was just a cool robot who completely wiped out the bad guys. Now I watch it, and see the other side that makes this such a masterpiece - the satire. The film is basically a mouthpiece for the criticisms of privatisation in the 1980s, and how it would lead to the problems of the future. Many of the news reports and the adverts are done so well, as both a piece of satire and in their creation, that you can't help but commend them. One thing that has horrified many people since the film's release, is the amount of violence in the film. The body count is very high, and the film contains some of the most disturbing scenes in film history - I could never watch killing of Murphy at the start, nor the part where one of the characters is covered in toxic waste. In essence, RoboCop is a film that MUST be seen. The satire, violence, comedy, and unique character of RoboCop make this a film that will last for a long time." "Robocop is, in one persons humble opinion, one of the great underrated films of the 1980's. On it's surface, Robocop looks like a straight action movie, with a slight science fiction bent. But peel back the layers, and you find a biting satire, covering multiple targets, from 1980's corporate and popular culture to action movies themselves. Opening in near future Detroit, we are introduced to the world of Robocop via a fast-paced television news program dubbed \"MediaBreak\" (It's motto \"Give us 3 minutes, we'll give you the world\"). What we see isn't pretty: Terrorists have seized Acapulco, white supremacy government in South Africa has a nuclear weapon (one aspect that dates the film), the Star Wars nuclear program is in full swing, and over 40 police officers in Detroit have been murdered by crime boss Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith). The Detroit police force has recently been privatized and is being run by uber-corporation Omni Consumer Product (OCP), and the recent police deaths has the force threatening a strike. OCP senior vice president Dick Jones (Ronny Cox) is about to introduce a new law enforcement robot, ED-209, but a malfunction during a demonstration of ED-209 gives junior corporate officer Robert Morton (Miguel Ferrer) an opening to pitch his pet project, dubbed Robocop, to the \"Old Man\" (Daniel O'Herlithy). At the same time, in a remote Detroit police precinct, officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) has just been transferred in and quickly finds himself in a bank robbery chase with his new partner Lewis (Nancy Allen). The chase leads to Murphy being captured by the robbers, led by Boddicker, who shoot Murphy down and leave him for dead. But he isn't quite gone. His brain and face are removed and used as the basis for Robocop: a half human, half robot police cyborg, complete with titanium outer skin and onboard computer memory to allow for recording of his activity. Robocop begins cleaning up crime on Detroit's dangerous streets, but an encounter with one of the gang that murdered him awakens memories within Robocop of his previous life, causing distress to his OCP handlers. With its title, and a very sci-fi, comic-style look for it's main character, it might be easy to dismiss Robocop as kids stuff, but the reality is much different. Robocop is a film that earned it's hard-R rating, featuring copious amounts of violence, language and occasional nudity, but it all serves a purpose. The 1980s saw the height of the action movie, with grander and more ridiculous sequences in action films multiplying with each passing year. Robocop is very much a reaction to that, and it's over the top violence is pushed to such extremes that it starts being funny. Screenwriters Ed Neumier and Michael Minor and director Paul Verhoeven push the boundaries of a standard action film in terms of violence and quickly makes other action films look as ridiculous as they really often are. But Robocop doesn't stop there. It comments on the dwindling attention span of television viewers (the brilliant MeidaBreak segments), television advertising (including commercials for a brand of artificial hearts as if they were items in a supermarket) and, most importantly, the explosion of corporate culture and public services falling under private control. Few key social issues that were hot buttons in the 1980's are left unaddressed in this film, and each new issue introduced makes a strong impression. Robocop isn't interested in just providing us with an action tale, it has an underlying message to go along with it. Most importantly, there is no self-aggrandizing or heavy-handed dialog and speeches to accompany this material. Viewers are left to pick up on it themselves. But, that being said, Robocop is actually a more rousing action film than many of it's counterparts that it is ridiculing. Most of Robocop's action scenes are well-produced and exciting, especially later in the film. It also helps that Minor and Neumier don't spare the character development. Robocop is a tragic character, a man who's life is cut short, who is deprived of his human body and most of his past, yet haunted by visions of his previous existence. He cannot truly reconcile the two, and some of the film's strongest scenes are ones in which Robocop revisits his old house only to become enraged by the fact that everything he remembers that was good is gone. On the acting front, there are two key standouts: Peter Weller and Kurtwood Smith. Weller has a tough job, getting us to care about a character that is covered in a giant metal suit and has limited facial expressions. But when the necessary moments arrive, Weller delivers, instilling his character with pathos. He pulls it off often with only a quarter of his face revealed. Smith creates a memorable film villain, his Clarence Boddicker so vicious, rude and vile you can't help but hate him. Prior to his role on That '70s Show, Robocop was Smith's most recognized work, and with good reason. It is unfortunate that time has not been kind to the Robocop character and the franchise in general. Two mediocre sequels, a short-lived television series and a quartet of Canadian-produced TV movies have done to the original film what the multiple Jaws sequels did to Steven Spielberg's initial masterpiece, they diminished it. But, if you strip away all the excess baggage that these other distractions provide, Robocop is still a great film, and one that should be better remembered." "This movie was released in the United States in 1987, but when I first enjoyed it here in Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico it was in the autumn of 1988 and I have never heard of it before, I didn't know why I never see any trailers. so when I watched it completely shocked me and amazed me and so far i have seen it maybe 30 times. All the main actors I have been following their careers very closely, I have been feeling very much appreciation and endearment with them, even the bad guys Kurtwood Smith,Jesse Goins, Ray wise, Paul McCrane Calvin Jung and Ronny Cox. The entire movie was full of emotion and spectacular stuff, pretty fast scenes one after another, the extreme violence hits really hard.Congratulations to Paul Verhoeven for his great science fiction movie, a total masterpiece." "I recently saw this for the first time, and loved it. Well, not exactly the first time I've see it, but the first time I've seen it start to finish. I've tried to watch this dozens of times, and for whatever reason I always get interrupted. Anyway, what an awesome movie! This has everything that a good action movie needs: Kurtwood Smith makes for an awesome villain, plus there's some semi-unexpected plot twists that I found pretty cool. Not to mention the awesome effects for the time. Though I singled out Kurtwood Smith, almost the entire cast does well in their roles. Peter Weller will and has gone down in history for his role as the title character, and well he should have! The ED-209 scene really caught me off guard, and I loved it. Overall, I say if you like action movies and haven't seen this....GO BUY IT NOW!!! I assure you that you wont be disappointed! 9/10" "Add another review" "Find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your Watchlist and rate your favorite movies and TV shows on your phone or tablet!")("Movies, TV & Showtimes" "Celebs, Events & Photos" "News & Community" "Watchlist" "" "Find industry contacts & talent representation" "Manage your photos, credits, & more" "Showcase yourself on IMDb & Amazon" "Sign in with Facebook Other Sign in options" "Own the rights?" "I had never seen this until 2006, I popped it in the DVD player and all of a sudden there was a stop motion machine that didn't look very real but still gave the affect it was aiming to give. Murphy (the man before he became Robocop) was the type of guy that seemed very likable so I felt sorry for him once he had died and was reincarnated in to a mindless robot. I must say that Robocop does have ultra violence but I never get tired of it. Robocop is the type of movie that I would buy and watch a couple of times before I would become bored of it because it so entertaining and never boring. If you have never seen Robocop I strongly advise you to because I promise you that you will not be disappointed. In conclusion, Robocop is very good and entertaining but don't expect out of this world special effects. Robocop can at times be annoying but after a while he grows on you." "I have finally seen this movie, its awesome!! I know I usually have to close an eye or maybe two if it considers special effects in movies from the 80's but this one is definitely not one of them. Good special effects! Very good sound effects too, the walking of robocop is really scary. I loved that scene too when robocop finally comes alive, It remembers me of \"the matrix\" although this movie is much older. The acting is very good, I have seldom seen movies where every villain plays his role well, but here is one! This movie does indeed contain quite some violence, quite some!!! So maybe it was good that I haven't seen it back then in the 80's. It never annoys though. The film keeps tension well reserved and I had the feeling that the movie was longer than the given 100 minutes or so? So my final question remains, why weren't robocop 2 (and maybe 3 too) not directed by paul verhoeven as well? Even today This movie is a masterpiece!!!" "A cop, Murphy, transfers to a new precinct in a bad part of town and is soon killed brutally in the line of duty. Coincidentally a totalitarian company, that owns the Police Dept, is developing a project for a cyborg policeman and Murphy is just intact enough to be revived as Robocop, the city's most effective enforcer of law. However, Robocop first doesn't know about his past as a human, but he soon begins to uncover it, along with plenty of corruption in the city. Verhoeven mayhem ensues. The story gives a nice focus to not only the action scenes, but to a cyborg discovering its former human-self. The common theme of man vs. machine is addressed from an unusual perspective here as the main character is really neither robot, nor human. Other, though equally respectable films, like The Terminator, draw a line in black and white: human is good, machine is bad. This interesting story angle should be enough for fans of science fiction to check watch this movie. The other part of the story is a futuristic satire about just how powerful we should let our big corporations be and just how much we should let them get away with. Robocop is a representation this is his often brutal, albeit effective, methods of dealing with criminals which all go without complaint. Also deserving mention are the special effects. They are top notch considering 1987 restraints for them. Obviously dated by now, but they are quite elaborate and the production did a good job of putting them together with nothing being digital. So, all in all, this is a good watch. 8/10 Rated R: a lot of graphic violence, and profanity" "My absolute favorite movie! #1 I have watched it over 200 times and love it! The 2 main sequels are OK and the others are just awful but the 1st really hits the mark with me. I saw it opening day and since purchased all version on DVD and watch it regularly. I was thrilled when my son wanted to watch it. I think it is on of the most original, brutal and funny movies ever. Oddly, I find myself quoting it often. \"... give that man a hand!\", \"... just give my f~n phone call\", \" I am a repeat offender... I repeat... I will offend again..\" See, I do love this film, everyone should watch it at least once." "Yes, that's right. Best Movie Ever. One of the best sci-fi movies of its own or any other time, ROBOCOP features a plot that, while it does find itself with a few little pot holes and gaps, flows smoothly enough for the true purpose to come through. For the most part, it's more about violence than anything. The plot holds its own to the extent that it does draw into various violent encounters, which in the end, are the entertaining factor of the movie. Amazingly low-budget, no truly big names, with a director who most people have never heard of- it still manages to be my favorite movie of all time. ROBOCOP 2 is just alright, with seemingly vast filler, and ROBOCOP 3 is just an attempt to market new action figures and should be sealed away and burned." "It is set in Detroit, in an unknown but quite near future. Capitalism has went beyond the limits of anyone's imagination. It has touched even the police and space agencies, all of these under control of Omni Consumer Products. OCP for short, it is a firm with HUGE ambitions: it attempts to create new city-- Delta City is the name-- from the ashes of the chaotic and crime-ridden Detroit. After failed attempts of creating a strong police force (loosing about 5 guys every week) or a good enforcement droid (ED-209, a bulky, 10-metres-tall droid kills an executive during testing), Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer), a young scientist and OCP corporate proposes a solution: the creation of a Robocop. He finally gets his candidate when Alex Murphy (Peter Weller), an honest and highly competent police officer gets brutally slaughtered by a sadistic group led by Clarence Boddicker. 40 days later, he is brought back to life as a crime-fighting cyborg. After a series of successful tests, OCP finds its popularity soaring and its position secured. But, after a months, things go somewhat awry as Robocop recalls his human past, and tells him to get revenge on the criminals that killed him... Loud, ultra violent sci-fi cop movie never lets up for a minute. One of the earliest of the cyborg craze that followed the Terminator, this movie stands out from its role model and its countless rip-offs. The story is slick and+ has the right combination of action and humour. the Special effects are eye-popping (with many nominations from various institutions), even by today's standards (ED-209 animation and Robo's first-person view, to name a few) and they make the movie entertaining. Peter Weller endured physical torture of sweating buckets in the costume, and He sure pulls it off: He makes this clunky , bulky machine look and act human, even more than at the first quarter of the movie in which he is ACTUALLY a human being. Despite these advantages, the movie is just a bit too short (99 mins PAL, 103 at NTSC format). There are not enough humane scenes to camouflage the movie's sometimes disturbingly dark and bleak view of the future, and Nancy Allen's performance is not exactly one of her best. But still, it's a lot of fun and it's one of the best sci-fi films of the '80s. *** out of ****" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Somewhere in the near future a cop, Alex Murphy (Peter Weller), gets shot by a punch of sadistic cop killer in his first day in new precinct. Omni Consumer Product, a company that owns the police takes his mortally wounded body and revives him as a mean, lean law-enforcement machine (drumm roll here) RoboCop. The OCP technicians thick they've erased Murphys memory, but soon a friendly face, a female cop Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen) recognizes him and soon they start their chase against the killers of Murphy. RoboCop was, and still is very good action film, despite of the fact, that age is showing through from the special effects, like military/police robot ED-209, which movements can't be even compared to modern day specials. But all this, and the overall comic book like plot, gives the movie its own charming look, making it fun to watch. Well okay, maybe fun is in some places of the film a wrong word, as most of the action scenes are a bit sadistic, Murphys Killing in the beginning, and bloody, every thing else in the action department. RoboCop also has a more satirical element in it, mainly pointed against capitalism: OCP, a company, which owns the police, mock up commercials, etc. As small funny element there's this small criticism towards violence in entertainment, when a family is shown playing a Nuclear War board game. but then again RoboCop IS violent entertainment. But I strongly want to note, that this movie is not meant to the smallest members of your family. I dare to say this movie is action classic." "I remember first seeing 'RoboCop' when I was about 8 or so. I do believe my reaction was: \"Cool! Robots!\". Now as my last months of being a teenager creep up on me, I watch 'RoboCop' and say \"Cool! Robots!\". How little I've changed... In the near future, Detroit is suffering from high crime rates and corruption. The Police force is saved by the private OCP corporation. Naturally, OCP is in the business of building killer robots that resemble miniature versions of the robots in 'Robotech'. Enter Alex Murphy (Peter Weller), a cop new to Detroit who dies nearly as soon as he's introduced. However, when you work for a company in the business of designing killer robots, the chances that you'll be brought back to life as a near-invincible, crime-fighting, super-robot are pretty high, and thus the near-invincible, crime-fighting, super-robot RoboCop is born. For a story about a near-invincible, crime-fighting, super-robot, 'RoboCop' is at least pseudo-intellectual. We given a future, with no definite date, that is slowly creeping up on us. A future that I think we'd all prefer to avoid. However, I learned a much more valuable lesson: robots seek vengeance too. No, I'm not going to be hooked by a warning of a dystopian-future. On the other hand, robots that seek vengeance... Now that's a different story altogether. I can't believe 'RoboCop' didn't leave more of an impression on me when I first saw it. I saw 'Aliens' at the same time, and I was freaked out for a year. Now when I watch 'RoboCop' I'm making my own tally, trying to figure out if the \"Bodycount: 30\" entry on the trivia page is accurate. 'RoboCop' is rather violent. I'm surprised I even managed to see it when I was so young, but I guess that's what kids do: watch awesomely violent action movies. The action scenes are awesomely cool - what more would you expect from a near-invincible, crime-fighting, super-robot? 'RoboCop' is a fine action film. It has some nice story elements for those who would consider it a 'Terminator' rip-off, but I am a devotee of the action genre, and 'RoboCop' is one of the greats - 9/10" "Robocop is a first-rate, first-class, superior sci-fi/action movie classic. This movie can only be described as 'overkill'and that's why we love it. Unrestrained violence, eccentric characters,abusive foul language, an uncompromising setting, these are just some of the ingredients that round off this rare gem of a film. This film was made in the pre-C.G.I era, so that makes the film even more of an accomplishment. Go and buy a copy of \"the directors cut\" of ROBOCOP because everybody should have it in their DVD collection. Unfortunately this film was followed by two defective and substandard sequels. ROBOCOP 2 was a completely inadequate follow-up and ROBOCOP 3 was a weak and fraudulent third chapter. However, the original stands as a true testament to exemplary sci-fi/action cinema." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "When honest cop Murphy is gunned down by gangland villains, he becomes the subject of a new pioneering technique to replace the police with robots. However, the human part of his mind still survives, goes after the villains who shot him and effectively ended his human life. Much more than simply an action film (though Robocop is filled with great action sequences), this is a look into the future of humanity. The de-humanising of the police, who are controlled by OCP, a big corporation who put no value on human life as long as they make money, and aren't above employing cop-killers to swat anyone who irritates them, is a genuinely disturbing thought. The heroes and villains of the film are all strong characters. The scene in which Murphy/Robocop takes his mask off and looks at his battle-scarred face in a reflective surface, accompanied by an atmospheric soundtrack, still sticks in my mind."

"*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "i don't know how i came to like robocop so much but i think it's part of my love for campy sci-fi and bleak futures. this movie is what i consider to be the greatest interpretation of he near future than any other movie. this is beating out a clockwork orange, blade runner and judge dredd. wait, scratch the last one, which sucked. back in 88 it some parts seemed too unreal, but now, those same parts aren't even funny anymore, because they're too real! the robotic heart- now exists. street police with body armor- now exists. the over aggressive businessmen- now exist. and i believe that if there ever was a cyborg cop, he wouldn't be all kool and like the matrix with wires everywhere and all high-tech and dark looking, he would look like robocop, and probably be called something similar if not exactly the same. this movie is smarter and more emotional than would be expected from a movie of it's title, is the classic man vs machine storyline with the twist that it takes place inside one person. as for the sequels, i love the second one. i think it has everything a sequel should, though not as good as the first, gives you a taste of robocop kicking ass. as for the third. ummmm. it might have been good had they gotten peter Weller. if they just put his voice in this movie it would make it twice as good, though suck it does. robocop rules. the main argument against it being \"it's too corny\" to which i say \"yeah, well that's what's real\". or is it? yes it is. isn't it? yes. ? ." "ROBOCOP is a future that is all too believable. With crime rampant and a company running law enforcement ROBOCOP is the hero whose gun never misses. The streets run red with blood as Robocop patrols the slums of Detroit. Robocop is a smart persons action film. ROBOCOP is written with darker than dark humor and moments which explore the half man half robots remaining humanity. One thing ROBOCOP is not is boring. The film has a steady pace which is more than enough to keep those with short attention spans awake. Adding to the believability of the film is the modern look of the surroundings. The only fantasy element in the film are the robots everything else is present day looking. The fantasy in the film never loses focus and never detracts from the film. Some films get drowned in the fantasy and fantasy elements. This one dosen't. I recommend this film but please keep in mind it has graphic violence." "You know at the club scene when Robocop is about to arrest Leon Nash?Right when Leon pulls the gun out of his pocket, Robocop knocks it out of his hand. Some dude with long gray hair catches it. Was that the director?" "Gratuitously violent, a satire of America of the future, a Christ metaphor, a tragic undercurrent over the notion of losing humanity and family and a villain who dies by melting and then being run over by a car. It may not sound like a brilliant film, but it is. Paul Verhoeven's RoboCop is right up there with Cameron's The Terminator in that it is a perfect piece of nostalgic entertainment, a film that is a representation of what was so brilliant about the 80's. Many budding reviewers that write about the film will always touch on the satirical matters of the film, and they are brilliant, especially in their regard to the representation of television, from the manner that the news is delivered to the entertainment that is offered (\"I'd buy that for a dollar\"). But where this film really touches me is in it's story. Paul Verhoeven may be a man of excess (just take a look at the level of violence in the director's cut of the film) but the way he brings across the story of Murphy marks it out as the finest film he has directed. Whereas Basic Instinct, Starship Troopers and The Hollow Man were all to wrapped up in showing us controversial and violent material, here he counterbalanced that philosophy with the emotional undercurrent. When RoboCop starts to learn more of his life when he was Murphy (brilliantly shown when he revisits his previous home) Verhoeven pushes the emotional buttons without dipping into sentimentality. The film has a heart and soul that is very genuine and that really tugs at you. I dare you not to be shouting \"Murphy\" at the end of the film. Of course it is the quality of the production that makes this film so brilliant and the performances. It makes one wonder how Peter Weller never became a bigger star, with his fine work here clearly in abundance. Ronny Cox and Kurtwood Smith are fantastic as the villains, with Smith's Nazi like Clarence Bodicker being a real stand out. Then there is the fantastic make up from Rob Bottin. Everything from the RoboCop suit and the melting effects done of Paul McCrane still standing up today in an era full of CGI. Plus I couldn't do this review without mentioning the fantastic music of Basil Poledouris. No 80's synthesisers here, a wonderful sweeping orchestra that is moving and sad and brings pathos and optimism to a fantastic package. To quote Emil, \"I LIKE IT\"." "Robocop is one of those 8o's action movies that you could watch over and over. I think Peter Weller has that uncanny robot voice and is perfect even though he couldn't act himself out of a paper bag. It is too bad they had to spoil this great action classic with some lousy sequels." "One of the greatest cult classics that has ever come about. This movie is made great by all things in it. Any movie with a ford taurus that has a 350 engine and front wheel drive is great. Robocop is fueled by almost as much great one liners than the king of one liners himself, who we all know to be Arnold. Robocop is a positive roll model for all youngsters growing up in todays society. When Robocop takes out Dick jones, he is showing that he is what is left that is good in society. E.D.-209 can gladly replace my dog any day. If every house had a devoted protector such as E.D.-209 then everyone could sleep at ease. Children could wake early Christmas morning play fetch with E.D.-209. Spouses could enjoy a soothing cup of coffee on the couch in a room lit by the fire place as E.D.-209 sits in defense ready stance on the rug infront of the mantal. E.D.-209 should be sold at pet stores round the world. Of course no one can truly experience Robocop with out getting inside and seeing all of the Robocop saga. You must see Robocop, Robocop 2, Robocop 3, Robocop: Prime Directives, which are Robocop Dark Justice, Robocop Meltdown, Robocop Ressurection, and Robocop Crash and Burn. There should be a Robocop doll by every childs bed that they can cuddle with in the night." "Peter Weller stars as Alex J. Murphy a mortally wounded police officer who is turned into a cyborg policeman, who fights crime in Detroit and decides to take revenge on the sadistic gang that murdered him in this powerful, violent and funny classic. Robocop has to be one of the ultimate superhero movies to date, it contains sharp satire and eye catching actionscenes, plus a first rate script. Peter Weller is extremely sympathetic in the part." "I remember when the trailers for this came out. When the voice-over intoned \"RoboCop- the Future of Law Enforcement!\" Everyone in the theater laughed. What a stupid title! But then it hit the screen and man, was it great! I bought it on DVD a while back and it was worth every dollar I spent. I truly love the satirical aspects of the film and how it savages the corporate-yuppie \"Greed is good\" lifestyle that did so much to disfigure the 1980s. The dialogue is great, too- I especially like the scene where Emil Antonowsky (Paul McCrane) says \"Hey, wait a minute! I know you- you're DEAD! We KILLED YOU! WE KILLED YOU!\" And then there was the hilarious \"Dave\" bit. My co-workers and I still yell the line, \"I'D BUY THAT FOR A DOLLAR!\" at one another!" "This film is really well made and everyone should check it out. This film has good action and a little sense of humor. The story is very good. Murphy/Robocop dies on his first day of the job and his body gets used for the Robocop program. So he is like brought back to life. After he becomes Robocop, his memory gets blanked so he won't remember his life. I like the way he goes and finds out who he was and who killed him. He also finds the bad guy in OCP who wants to destroy him. The music is good too and fits in with the theme of the movie. If you really like Sci-Fi films you will like this one. 10 stars for the movie." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "******Warning, Spoilers******** The 1980's, for all its faults, was surely a golden age for intelligent sci-fi/action films - think The Terminator, Aliens and Predator. 1987's Robocop sits comfortably alongside these films as a classic of the genre. Despite the bucketloads of gore and a title which is absolutely ridiculous if one stops to think about, this is a film with heart and soul, and most importantly a message. Paul Verhoeven, directing his first US film, brings the critical eye of an outsider to the me-first decade, and uses the films futuristic setting to lampoon 80's corporate America for all it's worth. Everything bad about yuppie culture is taken to extremes - executives assassinate one another, are involved with organised crime, and see the fact that a fellow exec has been turned into a hamburger by a psychopathic robot as a 'temporary setback'. This is Wall Street with cyborgs and a wicked sense of humor. What's amazing about this film is how tightly scripted it is. It clocks in at just 102 minutes, not one of which is wasted. Verhoeven cleverly uses fictional TV news and commercials to build the world the characters inhabit (a technique he would reuse to lesser effect in Total Recall and Starship Troopers), thereby dispensing with the need to have lots of long winded exposition scenes. These segments are where the films satire goes into overdrive - kids play with a high tech version of battleships called Nuke-Em' (\"Get them before they get you!\"), a car named a 6000 SUX is advertised, and a Star Wars strategic defence 'peace platform' incinerates Santa Barbera. The storyline itself is pretty standard comic book stuff - cop gets shot up and turned into cyborg and then has to regain his humanity, but it's told so well, and in such a brilliantly realised setting, that its elevated above its pulp origins. The cast all turn in decent performances, particularly Kurtwood Smith as over-the-top baddie Clarence Boddicker. Also, if you've only ever seen Nancy Allen in Carrie, her turn as ass-kicking cop Ann Lewis is an eye opener. The violence, while extreme (even more so in the directors cut), is more often than not played for laughs - it's hard to take the bit when Emil drives into the toxic waste seriously. A word of praise also for Phil Tippets wonderful stop motion ED - 209. In terms of being a movie with meaning, Robocop should probably be counted among Paul Verhoevens earlier Dutch work such as Soldier of Orange, rather than his later Hollywood offerings. Well worth a look if you only know him as the guy who directed Showgirls.

"This is one great American movie. It has your heroes and your villains. It's got some humor and it's packed full of graphic violence. This is a classic that nobody can deny. This movie rocks. The kind of movie that makes your ass wanna get up and cheer. Robocop, one hell of a movie." "I would have liked to have been in the room when Paul Verhoeven pitched Robocop: \"Ok, you've got this cyborg cop fighting crime in 'old' Detroit; setting: the not too distant future. There'll be political intrigue, bloody over-the-top action, commercials for invented products and very large explosions. But it is going to be funny...it's an action/comedy. Oh, and it will star Peter Weller from that BUCKAROO BANZAI flick...and Jose Ferrer's kid, what's-his-name...whatever. Gimme, gimme, gimme money so I can make this great and deranged film!\" How did ROBOCOP get made? Who cares...it is a great movie. I saw this when I was ten or eleven and thought it was the pinnacle of cinematic achievement. Was there a better film circa 1988? Not for me there wasn't. Since then, I've grown up...expanded my knowledge of film, and realized that perhaps ROBOCOP isn't quite the masterpiece that I had thought. It still stands the test of time, however, and remains wonderfully entertaining. Kurtwood Smith's villain stands out as one of the most slimy of the 80's (along with Alan Rickman in DIE HARD). The makeup effects, by Rob Bottin, remain far superior to the computer generated effects they blight films with now; Basil Poledouris' musical theme is one of the most \"hummable\" in recent memory. A shudder never fails to work its way up my spine at some of the most gruesome moments... Films like ROBOCOP, PREDATOR, GREMLINS, DIE HARD amongst others, shaped my life from fragile early childhood. This may explain why I was so screwed up: I rigged sqibbs on my G.I. Joe figures, I laughed at car accidents, and was well on my way to becoming completely de-sensitized to all violence. But what are you going to do right? ROBOCOP helped me through some painful moments during my life as well. Like when I saw Ronny Cox in 'Cop Rock'; I said \"that's Dick Jones, he runs OCP! He runs the cops!\" What the hell was he doing singing on TV?...\"What would ROBOCOP do in this situation?\" I would ask myself as I began hitting the television screen with a chair. And why didn't Kurtwood Smith get better roles than THE CRUSH? He was in ROBOCOP right?...he's a movie star! Why didn't anyone else think that Nancy Allen was sexy?... It took me awhile to realize that (while as good as ROBOCOP is) it is simply a high-concept B-flick that walks a fine satirical line. If Verhoeven would have missed one step along the way, ROBOCOP could have quickly become one of the worst films of all time. He pulls it off, however, and let's hope that his warped film will continue to corrupt the youth of America for years to come. Excuse me now, I have to punch out all the windows of my car. Thank You. 8/10" "A lot of ppl call this movie violent. No it isn't. That's just red jam coming out of everyone's wounds...argh, it's so simple. Anywho...this movie is so cool cuz the concept was awesome, the story moves well, the bad guys are really evil (read: kurtwood smith is gold EVERYWHERE, and ronny cox), and for an action film with lots of violence (violence for a reason), it had emotion and it's funny parts. Oh and as a kid the evil bot FREAKED me out. Crazy... Anywho, if you haven't watched this, then what you waiting for? Do it now!" "When I first saw \"Robocop\" during its 1987 theatrical run, I was seventeen years old and quite honestly had never seen a movie THAT violent in my entire life. Naturally, I loved it. The story was straight out of comic books (which are another passion of mine...and Robo DID eventually make it into comics a year or two after the first movie), and \"Robocop\" has a wicked sense of humor that elevates it past the normal mindless blow-em-up action picture. I enjoyed both sequels as well, but nothing beats the original. Fifteen years later it's kind of funny to see Kurtwood Smith, who played Robo's arch-nemesis Clarence Boddicker, playing \"Red\" on \"That 70's Show\", though. :) The eventual syndicated televison series toned down the mayhem of the films and is pretty much unwatchable unless you're hung over and there's nothing better on TV. Stick with the film series, starting here." "ive seen this movie hundreds of times and is still awesome!! the best cyborg bought on film ever. Peter Weller is excellent as Robo and the villains are great. check out the directors cut, even better!! 10/10" "Robocop is a great movie. A+, one of my favorites definate good movie to own , but better to own on DVD or DVD limited edition!! I'm hoping to get my hands on the limited edition (regular version, uncut). In fact it is the best robocop movie that there is. You can even check ratings. Do not see any other robocop's were horrible." "I can play \"Soldier of Fortune\", I can watch \"Day of the Dead\", but i just cannot stomach the violence in Robocop. It's horrible, it disturbs me beyond belief and is literally nauseating. The thing is about the violence is that it's exaggurated. For example, in this film, if someone cut their finger open, there'd be fountains and fountains of blood that would flood the room. As it happens, no one cuts their fingers. But arms are blown off, brains gush out of bullet riddled heads, and one man gets his guts blown open by a minigun. It's horrible! The most unwatchable film ever!" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "[CONTAINS SPOILERS] This movie is an all-time favorite of mine. I didn't like it when I first saw it, but I went back and watched it again later and loved it. This one, II and III are all favorites. I rented them at the video store so much I probably put the retailer's kids through college. The city of Detroit is currently in turmoil. A cop killer named Clarence Boddicker and his men are wreaking havoc on the city and killing cops this way and that; A giant corporation called OCP (Omni Consumer Products) owns half of it. It's run by The Old Man (Halloween III: Season of the Witch's Dan O'Herlihy) and his partner Dick Jones (Ron Cox). OCP is also in control of the local police department where a new cop, Murphy (Peter Weller who turned 55 2 days ago) was joining. He's partnered with Anne Lewis, an aggressive street cop. Meanwhile, a meeting is held at the OCP complex. They've decided human police officers are inefficient so they've build a giant automation called ED-209, programmed to stop crime dead in its tracks. Literally. A young executive volunteers to do a demonstration, but ED-209 backfires and frontfires at the poor man. (Gruesome!!!) All seems lost until an ambitious executive Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer) decides to make his own crime fighting machine. Only he must find a candidate to become the machine. Poor Murphy is killed by Clarence and his men so they turn him into the machine: RoboCop. He foils a liquor store robbery attempt and saves the mayor's life. Anne Lewis recognizes Murphy in all that armor. One by one, RoboCop arrests Clarence and his men. Only problem: they're on Dick Jones' payroll. He bails them out of jail and sics ED-209 on Robo. So he and Lewis hideout at a refinery. Clarence and his men go after him with hi-tech weaponry. Robo takes them all out then heads back to OCP to prove Dick Jones guilty. The day is saved, thanks to RoboCop (Murphy.) A brilliant movie, I must say. See it! I recommend it! (If you've got the uncut DVD, you'll see this movie the way it was meant to be seen. It's very gruesome and graphic, but if that's your cup of tea, it's your cup of tea). -" "Recently, I decided to reaquaint myself with an old friend, Paul Verhoeven's sci-fi classic: Robocop. It's brilliance still shines after all these years. Film critic Mark Kermode once said that what made The Exorcist brilliant, was the fact that it worked on so many levels. Robocop works on even more levels: as an action film, it more than delivers, as a social commentry, it gives us a stern warning about the direction we are going in, as a satire, it takes stinging stabs at the Regan era with the privitisation of the police etc. ''You have 20 seconds to comply.''" "Verhoeven has this apocalyptic vision I believe that inspires brilliance in many of his films. ROBOCOP is arguably the best of all of them, though TOTAL RECALL remains probably his most successful and arguably Schwarzewnegger's piece de resistence! Everything about ROBOCOP bears the mark of professionalism. Tight script, superb action sequences and outstanding fx. Peter Weller, unfairly categorised as a \"B\" List actor (mainly through lack of being offered better roles) is spot on here as Officer Murphy, sadistically tortured and shot whilst doing his duty (a graphically presented set-piece that doubtless incurred it's \"R\" certificate) whose few remaining functional parts are cannibalised in the re-construction of the bio-mechanical lawman ROBOCOP. Wanna tell me we couldn't use a guy like this now? Verhoeven pits intelligence against violence in a deft weave. The film is multi-layered and can be viewed on levels ranging from the mindless to the quizzical. Is there not a strong religious theme here after ROBOCOP himself is cruelly \"murdered\" and then resurrected? The film heightens both the inherent evils present in modern day living and the fact that still, decency and honor win out eventually? For all its violence, which its detractors still gleefully evince, ROBOCOP remains I consider, a socially responsible film. As action fare alone, it was not only one of the best on offer in the 80's (it kicked ass, like none before it) but it was years ahead of its time. Watching it today, it has aged but little. Do not even THINK of comparing it to the one-dimensional Verhoevenless sequel which was as bad as this was great!"

"Paul Verhoeven's Robocop is a most unusual type of film. It succeeds in being almost everything. On the surface, the film might just look like an action picture. And it's exactly that. Robocop is ungodly violent; just as it should be. Robocop is also a wicked satire, on everything from the media to big corporations. Like most Paul Verhoeven films, Robocop is brilliant. Violent and funny -- the perfect 80's movie." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Released in 1987, Robocop, the movie, stands as the ultimate symbolic testament to Christianity. Unlike other movies of the decade like The Breakfast Club, St. Elmo's Fire, or Sixteen Candles, Robocop was not afraid to be religious, entertaining and packed with butt kicking action. Like other movies depicting Christ figures (i.e. The Terminator, Aliens and Superman III), Robocop was extremely poignant omitting no details of the life and times of Jesus Christ. The movie begins by introducing Officer Alex Murphy, a streetwise cop with a soft side. He is gunned down by an affiliation of drug pushing psychopaths. I was immediately reminded of the Romans and how they gunned down Jesus in that seemingly abandoned warehouse. After Murphy is considered dead, an organization called OCP combines the biological flesh of his body with steel, circuitry and a fistful of attitude. This was exactly like the resurrection. As Jesus did rise, so did Alex Murphy. Sure, back in Biblical times, they could only really rebuild Jesus with wood and cement, so it might take a stretch of the imagination to fully see the connection. Murphy, in the form of Robocop, is sent out onto the mean streets of Detroit. As he guns down criminal after criminal in a savage manner, I was reminded of the way Christ shot up Roman oppressors like lambs bent for slaughter. The end of the movie is where it gets really good. The drug pushing psychopaths that attacked Murphy, a.k.a. Proto-Jesus, are cornered by Murphy. They try to stop him with a giant magnet, somewhat similar to the way Satan caught Jesus in a tiger trap. Robocop gets free and in a series of dizzying action sequences, he blows the leader of the drug pushers away, until there's not even enough left of him to smear like Jelly on toast. Then, Robocop ascends to the Heavens in order to wage war on Lucifer's armies. This opened up for Robocop 2: Cyber-Revelations. Some have told me that they missed the symbolism that showed Robocop as a Christ figure. I don't see how that's even possible. Not even Terminator 2 had this many references to Biblical scripture and that movie starred Arnold Schwarzenegger, the `GOD' of action cinema." "Robocop will always rank as a unique oddity within a genre that is constantly regurgitating itself. Paul Verhoeven created a masterpiece, a film which comments on the human condition and makes a statement about life and living. It's quite a head trip to watch this movie, not just for Robocop finding his roots but how the system that created him decides to play God with their reanimated creation. Verhoeven always manages to make a film which is typically entertaining to some degree, and Robocop is such a distinction. Peter Weller and Kurtwood Smith were excellent, and let's not forget about one the best sci-fi scores ever by Basil Poledoris!" "Made in 1987, this film paints a rather bleak picture of the future in it's depiction of the escalation of crime in a major metropolitan area (in this case, the city of Detroit), but what's really disconcerting watching it now is the fact that the reality of today seems to be catching up and closing in on this fictional future all too quickly. And it's a scary proposition when you think about it, which makes `Robocop,' an action/drama directed by Paul Verhoeven, something of a cautionary tale, as well as engrossing entertainment. Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is a veteran police officer, newly assigned to crime infested `Old Detroit,' which is about to undergo a major renovation. Plans are on the board for a multi-million dollar new city, but first the vermin who control the present city have to be eliminated. Toward that end, OCP, the major corporation apparently controlling just about everything (including the police department), are about to unveil a new kind of `policeman,' that will make the `Murphy's' of the force nothing more than support units. What they're proffering is an ominous looking robot, the `Ed-209,' touted by OCP Vice President Dick Jones (Ronny Cox) as the law enforcement of the future. An up-and-comer with OCP, Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer), has ideas of his own, however, that involve a project he's been trying to implement that would feature yet a different kind of `future cop.' And when a demonstration of Ed-209 goes awry, Morton makes his move, pitching his plan to `The Old Man' (Dan O'Herlihy), the CEO of OCP. Murphy, meanwhile, on his first day of duty in Old Detroit, is brutally gunned down and killed (or is he?) by a gang of criminals lead by one Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith). Bad for Murphy, good for Morton, however, who proceeds to turn Murphy into a prototype of his vision of the future of law enforcement. Enter `Robocop,' half human, all cyborg. Good for Detroit, bad for criminals, especially Boddicker and his gang. Because somewhere deep inside of what's left of Murphy, is a glimmer of memory. And Boddicker's face was the last thing he ever saw. Going into this project, Verhoeven definitely had a vision of what he wanted this film to be. That vision was dark and violent, and he succeeded in bringing it to fruition, in grand and graphic style. The finished product is extremely violent and at times unpleasant to watch; but it's also riveting filmmaking, and quite effective. it works because Verhoeven gives you more than just a gore-fest; despite the graphic violence (the scene in which Murphy is gunned down, for example, is beyond brutal), he keeps the human element at the heart of the story. He never lets you forget that beneath all that armor there is-- or was-- a man. And he gives you just enough background of Murphy's personal life to make you care about him, and it makes what happens to him all the more disturbing. On the other side of the coin, his villains are despicable, and you get to a point where you can't wait for Robocop to mete out the justice they so readily deserve. Verhoeven's presentation is solid and cohesive, perfectly complementing the action with the drama, which affords the audience a satisfying cinematic experience. And quite an experience it is. In a challenging role, Peter Weller succeeds in his portrayal of this man-turned-machine; in lesser hands, Robocop may have been nothing more than a machine with a bit of flesh beneath the metal, but Weller plays to the man inside, rather than the machine that encases him, and it makes a huge difference in the way the character is perceived. Weller's performance enables the audience to become emotionally involved with the `Murphy' he presents, rather than offering just a soulless `Robocop,' which from an action standpoint would have been fine, but would have diminished the drama and the overall impact of the film. Obviously, this is something Verhoeven and Weller realized, and in the final analysis, it was their collaboration and like-minded approach to the character that made this film really work. Another interesting aspect of this film is that there are three significant villains, each plying their own unique brand of treachery, and all effectively presented by the actors portraying them. Cox epitomizes the unscrupulous corporate executive, who cares less about the service or product he can provide than the `bottom line,' while Ferrer's Morton is an insufferable snake. The worst of the bunch, however, is Smith's Boddicker, the kind of villain you love to hate, but who is also unsettling upon reflection, as his outward appearance so subtly masks what a truly evil individual he is. You hate to think that there are really people like this walking around free in the world. Also turning in memorable performances are Nancy Allen, as Murphy's partner, Anne Lewis; Ray Wise, as Leon Nash, one of Boddicker's bunch; and Paul McCrane, as Emil, another of Boddicker's men (McCrane is especially good at creating characters you despise, as he does with his portrayal here, and currently as Dr. Romano is TV's `ER'). The supporting cast includes Robert DoQui (Sergeant Reed), Felton Perry (Johnson), Jesse D. Goins (Joe), Del Zamora (Kaplan), Calvin Jung (Minh), Rick Lieberman (Walker), Lee de Broux (Sal), Mark Carlton (Miller) and Edward Edwards (Manson). Hard-edged, thought-provoking, visceral entertainment, `Robocop' is a film you may have to steel yourself a bit for, but it's well made and delivered, and ultimately, a mesmerizing cinematic experience that far exceeds the typical action genre formula. It's violent, but then again, so is real life; and this is one of Life's stories." "I went to this movie with skepticism, and left loving it. Fictitious, but with realism in the what if extent of the possibility of this happening. This is a good film about the victim finding out the question of Who am I. When the guy gets fired, you will understand how that goes with the prime directive. The commercials, and news stories create humor, and realism at the same time. I love the dark humor, they use the dad from \"That 70's show\" as a heel, with a lot of humor when he does a hit, where they play a video cd. The end is great, and the film goes full circle, but you got to laugh at what happens to the Ed 90, and I love those Cobra Assault guns. Rent this if you love Sci-fi. 10/10" "Forget Dirty Dancing and all those other so called 'feel good' films. This is what cheers people up, seeing scummy little criminals beaten to a pulp by an indestructible being. The only shame is that it was make believe & they weren't real muggers, robbers & thieves. We could do with some real 'robocops' at the moment. We don't really need any other films in this genre though as this has really said all there is, but it's always worth a look. 8/10" "This classic near-future sci-fi works both as the ultra-violent effects-laden action flick and the cynical critisism of the corruption that permeates our modern world. It is full of memorable one-liners and over the top shocker scenes. Violence is abundant but never pointless or glorified. The movie is by far not without flaws... for example, what about the scene when he consults the database in the police station? Aren't they seeing what kind of truth he has discovered and wouldn't they somehow prevent him from going out and \"doing his job\"? But the good thing is that things like these don't really matter. The film just keeps rolling and your thoughts don't linger on the flaws. This is one of the rare films that you tend to enjoy not as much for its substance but rather its style and for a couple of scenes that can be re-watched without ever getting boring BUT at the same time does score some rather strong points in terms of message, ability to provoke thought and overall intelligence. 8/10" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Warning: Possible Spoilers I loved this movie. It was dark, and yes it was violent, but is was very cool. The mixture of comedy (for example, the continuous stream of T.V. ads for stuff such as a board game called \"Nuke Em!\") and drama (I found the scene where RoboCop discovers the fate of his wife and child strangely moving) works really well. When I first saw it, I wasn't expecting it to be so much of a satire, but it was this that leant the movie its edge. Performances were okay. Weller did as much of a good job as he could within the suit, and Allen was likeable as his sidekick. Kurtwood Smith and Ronny Cox were sufficiently evil as the bad guys, making the film greatly entertaining. Plus, how could you not love a movie which contains everyone's favourite \"melting man being run over\" scene. 9 out of 10." "This movie is one of the best movies of all time. The special effects, the musical score, everything about it is great. I've seen this movie over and over and it never gets boring. Peter Weller is excellent playing the famous Robocop. To put in simple words what I think about the movie: Robocop rules!" "Robocop,Paul Verhoeven's Sci-fi action yarn is the best film I have ever seen.It is intelligent with its political and American social issues and Director Paul Verhoeven does more than deliver the overblown and ultra stylish action set pieces(the melting man,the warehouse shootout). It also delivers on the violent side, most memorable of course is the death of Murphy as he executed in the same way as Jesus. The trashy news flashes bring out the comedy in the film,and the death of Murphy pulls the tragic side of the drama into it.The film moves at a rollicking pace,is never taken too seriously and leads you all the way through to the truly thrilling climax. A matchless masterpiece, and a film that you have to see to believe!"

"*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS It may have been produced purely to capitalize on the success of that other eighties cyborg cult-hit The Terminator, but Robocop still manages to not only thrill, but also entertain. I use the word still, but to be honest, I only saw the film really for the first time today (I got the Director's cut DVD today for my birthday), so I have no idea what people though of it when it first came out, I know it must have been big business as it necessitated two crap sequels and two TV spin offs (one animated, one live action). I also remember the kids at my high school talking about it every time it was show on television the night before, I was once lucky enough to see one of those screenings, but sadly for me, it was edited for TV. Which made watching Verhoeven's gore splattered director's cut toady a real eye opening experience. Where as in the TV version, say for example Murphy's (Peter Weller) death scene, we saw some guns go off, heard a couple of comedic one-liners, then wee saw a body hit the floor. So, for the rest of the film, we had no idea what kind of agony Murphy went through, so therefore, we are unable to feel enough of a connection with him to get more out of the film. But seeing the character of Murphy destroyed by shotgun blast in the un-cut version, his limbs torn from his body, the laughs and now menacing one-liners, only made Robocop's struggle all the more moving as the film reached it's third act. That's always been my problem with the censor board, they are all to willing to have guns, being fired and people being killed, but we're not allowed to see the actual effect that a gun can do to a human body. So we get films like the Matrix, in which fifty people are killed (by the hero I might add) being deemed suitable for young teenagers, and that's fine, as long as we don't see the consequences of a violent act. Then, conversely we can have a film like Natural Born Killers, which was held back from distribution and brought-up all kinds of political debates, as to whether or not the film was dangerous, all because Oliver Stone was brave enough to show the effect that violent crimes have on people, maybe if he didn't do the greatest job with said material, he was still persecuted for a film in which, although about killers, had less people killed than in the Matrix. And this is a problem that has followed Verhoeven throughout his career. Admittedly, sometimes the violence in his films can be exploitative, like for example Star-ship Troopers, but in Robocop the violence is completely justified, as it's from that unforgiving violent act that the story is developed. Judging from Robocop, they should really let euro art-house directors make Hollywood blockbusters more often. Paul Verhoeven, then better know for his Dutch art films Turkish Delight, Soldier of Orange and The 4th Man, not only heightens the dramatic impact of the characters, but also the harsh social critique directed at America. The film not only looks at the problems with capitalization if big business, the privatisation of the police force, and the growing consciousness of the mass media, it also has a strong message about the triumph of the soul. How many blockbusters would even attempt to pick-up on any of those issues, few I can think of. A truly underrated film from the eighties cycle of violent action. 8/10" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "I loved this movie. The violence is good in this movie. The bad guys are hatable in it. Dick Jones was an excellent bad guy. So was Clarence Bodicker. There won't be many more villains like them. MINOR SPOILER - directive 4 was a brilliant idea for this movie.END OF SPOILER. The Old Man that owns OCP in this one is cool. This one is lots of FUN. The action , violence , ideas, and acting all make this movie legendary. Alot of the scenes happen at night which I thought was cool. This movie has one of the best endings ever to it. Bob Morton the guy that designs Robocop is likeable too. This is a good move with a good plot good violence and good characters." "RoboCop is one of the greatest movies ever made and it is also my favorite movie. It has a great story about a man who was killed on the line of duty and resurrected as a crime fighting cyborg. Yes this movie has a lot of violence but I think it is relevant because it matches the story and it also shows how bad the world can get. Also this movie is about slavery. Murphy was robbed of his right to die. He has become a slave of the world because of his directives to serve the public trust, protect the innocent, and to uphold the law. As a cop he had the choice to bend the rules to get things right. But since these rules are now programmed into him, he has to follow them to the letter. Even if he wanted to save someone and it meant bending the rules to 'uphold the law' he could not. Worse yet, there was a fourth directive to never oppose an OCP officer. OCP was the bad guy but he could not do anything about it. If he was fully human then maybe he could. A great movie with a great story. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes Sci-fi. I also recommend RoboCop: Prime Directives which was a great mini-series. Anyway, I think this movie is the greatest Sci-fi movie ever!" "Detriot cop peter weller is transformed in to unstopable crime fighting machine,after being guned down by a gang of violent thug's. Then goes out to get revenge. Savage sc-fi action with some nicely satirical moment's on the behalf of big corporation's. Started conterversal dutch director paul verhoeven's hollywood career. Sc-fi fan's will love it but some may be replused by it's graphic violence. five stars out of five" "Paul Verhoeven's ambitious action masterpiece was a huge success at the time of its release in 1987, but I tend to think that it would not be nearly a successful if a film like it had been released today. Action and science fiction movies have come a long way since the 80's, and it's also no secret that the success of Robocop owes a huge amount to it's far superior predecessor, The Terminator, but Robocop is also very much able to stand on its own. The first Teminator film, released in 1984, is undeniably the film that really launched interest in the whole man vs. machine/cyborg theme, Robocop came along a few years later and renewed that interest, then we had a pathetic installment called Cyborg from Van Damme in 1989, a couple of mediocre Robocop sequels, and of course, the stunningly successful and well-made Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Robocop is separated from The Terminator most significantly in that the entire movie takes place in the future and there is not time travel (other than that) involved. The conflict here is not necessarily between man and machine, but between man and man where machine is used as a weapon between the two. It is definitely a more basic version of the almost universal good vs. evil story structure, with man on either end of the story in this case and each with their own superhuman robot to fight the other with. The story is thankfully complicated by the involvement of a gang of tremendously hardcore criminals who work for the bad guys at OCP but are not necessarily controlled by them, which leaves open a lot of possibilities in the plot and prevents it from being entirely predictable. Robocop is definitely among the most violent non-Scorsese films out there, almost to the point of being nauseating. This is definitely not something to show to the kids (although my parents allowed me to watch it over and over when I was a kid myself  I don't know how I could stand it), but it's good for something to watch when you're in the mood for what seems to be a really bad action movie that somehow managed to succeed. The movie is well written and well-acted (although some of the criminals in the film were exaggerated to the point of amusement), and has some startlingly realistic special effects, especially the shootings (although I've never actually seen anyone get shot before, so I can only assume that that's what it looks like). Robocop is almost like a cult classic, because someone who watches it now for the first time is not likely to enjoy it very much although original fans are likely to defend the film to no end, but it is definitely among the best of director Paul Verhoeven's U.S. films, which include mediocre productions like Showgirls and Hollow Man. This movie is undoubtedly more violent than most people are likely to enjoy, but if there is a place in modern cinema for gratuitous violence(and I tend to think that there is) then it is in movies like Robocop. It is a movie that was never meant to win any Academy Awards, and it earns respect by not pretending that it is." "Paul Verhoeven's sophomore effort and still his best.Set in Detroit, the near future, we see that crime is rampant. In comes OCP, a giant corporation the likes that will exist in the States within ten years (a merger between, say, General Electric, Exxon and Microsoft) to deliver a new weapon against crime. Their first project failed due to a slight mishap, poor Mr. Kinney. That weapon is Robocop, part man - namely former cop Murphy who stood in the way of a barrage of gunfire and did not live to tell about it- and part machine. Only, Murphy's brain wasn't completely erased and soon he's out on the town to find Boddicker, the man that did this to him. Turns out that Boddicker is teaming up with OCP's own Vice-President to stop Robo in his tracks. So what makes this one so interesting. Satire as always, on American life, consumerism, big business, the media, violence, lots of violence and in the middle a Christlike parable. See Robo walk on water in his final confrontation with Boddicker! The commercials - Nuke'Em, the family game-, the bits of TV-news -the new SDI-space center misfired, killing four former Presidents- and the inner workings between the OCP exec's are all meant to poke fun at American society, a society that can use a bit of critique every once in a while (well, maybe not this week). But beware, this movie oozes with gore, the scene where badguy nr. 6 drives his van in a big vat of chemical waste comes to mind, and violence. Alternatively, if you're into that sort of thing, the DVD has got the uncut version, filled with even more bits of mayhem. Don't bother with the sequel; it tried to emulate but never came close." "Ultraviolence at its best! RoboCop is one of the most violent movies I have ever seen, but this doesn't make it bad at all. Paul Verhoeven exaggerates with violence into a whole new level in cinematic history, and has thereby created a great atmosphere, which makes it a great movie. The story is fairly good (good guys vs. bad guys), ok for a sci-fi action-movie. The acting was good and I especially liked Kurtwood Smith (Clarence) as the arch villain, somehow his parts in movies always end up being a bad guy and he's outstanding in that specific job! In overall it holds a great entertaining-value and is a movie you can watch over and over again! 8 out of 10" "Let's set the record straight, RoboCop isn't Terminator and Paul Verhoeven isn't James Cameron. However, these two are very similar in their styles and this is proof. The mixing of crude or vulgar humor with gory (what some may consider excessive) violence is wonderful. You can't help but laugh when the store thief, rapist, or ultra-cool ED-209 get theirs in particularly funny was. Granted the seriousness and decay of Detroit causes more serious deaths (Clarence, Joey, Bob Morton, misc. police) the corporate cruelty befalling the city by the underworld only reinforces the fact that our society is becoming more and more like this one. Beware the enforcement droids!" "Simply a brilliantly made film, which seems humorous considering the subject matter. Verhoeven manages to create an atmosphere that hasn't really been touched since. The ultra-violence mixes superbly with the dark comedy to create the just-slightly-in-the-future Detroit setting. Then, to top it all off we get a great Christ parable as well. Murphy is killed and then resurrected in order to clean up the system. Keep your eyes peeled near the end so you don't miss the walking on water scene. They actually built boards under the water for Peter Weller to walk on so don't think it's just shallow water, that's on purpose. Basically, if you can handle the violence and you're prepared for the tongue in cheek attitude of the movie, you've got to love it. Just don't watch Robocop 3 whatever you do." "When this film first came out I went with my father to see it. We were on an extroadinarily long line, my first \"blockbuster\" film experience that I could remember (I can barely remember waiting for E.T. my only other previous experience with such a high scale film). Needless to say, when the ED-209 scene came on, I was flipping my shihtzu (heh), and we had to walk into Revenge Of The Nerds II instead. Crica: 1989, I rented Robocop, trying to understand the extreme emotions from only a few years previous. I like to think that a movie capable of extracting such extreme emotions as it did me, from an individual is worth checking out. This movie ended up becoming one of my favorite Sci-Fi films of all time. I love Paul Verhoven, he is such a visionary director. A lot of people seem to end up asking the \"how\"s and \"why\"s of his material, which is more often than not a personally motivated statement, usually personal vision of social commentary. This film works on both levels of social commentary in an extreme ideal that it could be interpreted to people who cannot look into the surreal elements of our culture and society everyday. You have to admit, it is quite surreal, and thus- in cinema, people expect reality times ten. A sort of reality on steroids, even in fantasy pieces. Verhoven delivers in this respect, but at points going over the heads of some of the more action-film prone audience who end up criticising rather than interpreting. Robocop's place in Sci-Fi history is somewhat skewed by its sketchy sequels, but I never judge a film by its followups. Never forget who or why, and the term \"how\" could be very well a recurrent theme in the fact of comparison to the fact that only a small handful of films in the following 14 years lives up to the quality of this films resolve."

"Robocop is one of those movies that kids weren't allowed to see but wanted to and did anyways. In Detroit a cop is killed by a drug lord and is brought back by a greedy company as a cyborg programmed to fight crime. The sleaze that killed Murphy has an devilishly programmed robot built by the same company pose a threat to him. The guy who plays the villain was very good and freaked me out as a kid. It's weird to see him on that 70's show. Peter Weller does a decent job as robocop and Murphy. Some of the movie doesnt hold up wiht time but the effects and violent action still hold up. The scene that always freaked me out was when the red head dude is hideously mutatedby toxic waste. Cool for action/adventure and sci fi fans.***" "I bought this movie on the DVD Criterion Collection, and I feel I am qualified to make the following statement. Paul Verhoeven should not make any more movies. This guy has made a lot movies that should not have been made. He made Showgirls and Basic Instinct, which how they got an R and not a NC-17 I will never know. He made The Hollow Man, which was nice eye candy. As was Starship Troopers and Total Recall. But all his (American) movies has one thing in common, I feel really dirty and guilty after sitting through them. Verhoeven is a technically masterful director. He works with accomplished actors and actresses with long distinguished careers, with the exception of Showgirls of course, but they are just dirty films. RoboCop is a great example of this. A science fiction movie with Kurtwood Smith and Peter Weller should be golden. It should be something that you would watch with your friends on a movie marathon night right between Terminator and Aliens. And while this movie is one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever, it really doesn't fit in with any other movie, you know except for Total Recall. Rating 8 but with reservations." "As a child of the 80's I would just like to say that this was the last great sci-film of that decade. Sci-fi just doesn't have the same meaning anymore. It's all effects driven nowadays, and that's not too tempting considering the fact that most cgi is so poorly done! But robocop didn't rely completely on ground-breaking visuals, instead there was a story to stand strong on. Filmmakers should one day take a break from their coke-snorting lives and take notes on this movie...it'd really help. And if I half to witness one more sci-fi abomination, THAT'LL BE THE LAST STRAW, I'll bloody switch to romantic comedies!!! Urgh!" "Don't let the comic book approach fool you. This story in primarily a drama, and a very human one at that. Murphy is a man, a human being, with a life, a love, a family, etc. All that is taken away from him, but not so much by the criminals with the shotguns like most people think. They were very cruel in 'dismantling' Murphy piece by piece, but at all times they were shooting at a PERSON. It was OCP's execs that finished the job in trying to remove his humanity from him. It was they that took the arm he had left, took his memories, took the things that we all take for granted. It was they that tried to remove the humanity from the man. But they failed. Murphy's humanity showed through at all times, though thinly at first. Just the twirling gun, the favorite catch phrase, just the little things we usually don't even think about. As his memories almost returned in the form of dreams his humanity responded next with a cry for vengeance. He sought out his killers, not realizing who the real killers were. When he DID find out who was really behind his death, it only led to him being brought down in a hail of gunfire again, this time at the hands of the police. Again his outside forces were trying to strip away his humanity, but this time it backfired. The human that had relearned courage and duty was now forced to relearn fear. Thus humanity was strengthened on one of our greatest failings. He survived the ordeal the second time, and it was then that he confessed his humanity to Nancy Allen's character. He could feel the loss of his family, but couldn't remember their names. After this he had to face his killers again. Boddicker and his gang? They hated him. They feared him. They wanted to kill him. Him. Not It. They were still shooting at a person, not a thing. At the end Murphy was robbed of the chance to overcome his programming and arrest Dick Jones, but it didn't matter by that point. The CEO (as played by Dan O'Herlihy) asked for his name, he gave it. Murphy. Not Robocop. His program still limited him much like the written laws might limit the spirit of what our police officers are trying to do while protecting us, but Murphy was a HIM now, never again to be an IT. All the jokes, the cartoonish violence, even that \"I'll buy that for a Dollar!\" guy couldn't distract from the sheer victory for humanity announced in that one simple two syllable word, Murphy." "Half man, half machine and he's a cop. What great subject matter for a gritty not-so-distant \"future\" movie. So my question is why did this concept take so long to be realized? It's an entertaining movie on different levels, but more so, it presents a very dark, sad, but true portrait of urban America as it is becoming. Crime is steadily increasing and law enforcement are understaffed, under budgeted, outnumbered and out gunned and it doesn't appear like it's going to be changing anytime soon. Welcome to New Detroit. The story of Murphy (Peter Weller) losing his own human live to only be turned around and made into a mecha savior for the masses is a topic all it's own. Sure the primary story arch is as gratifying as it is easy to follow - there's a conspiracy of some grand level going on as there always is and its very easy to spot the bad guys, who are clear and clear bad, but no matter on how many levels this movie engages you - it works brilliantly in the face of it's own simplicity noticeably because of these layers. I could drown on about it some more, but you really need to see the movie for yourself. Paul Verhoven who's known to do some pretty controversial and high profile material emerges from this movie with an instant classic. The story works its weaves, the cast is good, the black humor and tone throughout is strong, the action done proper and the whole thing stands up well faced with genre peers. If only the Verhoven-less sequels could have kept the train from leaving the track." "I watch this several time and I never got bored. Despite of so called \"cartoon\" feel, it didn't really bother me (The similar formula used later in Starship Troopers) The story is pretty good and it mixed with irony, satire, humor and melodrama. 8 out of 10" "From the year 1970 to 2000 there were more people killed at crime scenes in the United States than all the wars the nation has ever indulged in from the year of its inception in 1776. The media loves crime and war, so the media tells us as it constantly searches for advertisers and consumers. Thus, this film, a \"kill-for-fun\" genre product, in keeping with Earth culture, is still engrossing and has a merciful strain of humanity running through it despite its body bag count. Perhaps this is more of a nod to the inside core of its market than any contact with compassion. If Mary Godwyn Shelley was alive in 1987, the year Robocop was released, instead of 1817, the year her novel, Frankenstein, was published; this film might have amused her. It lifts its best elements from her immortal book." "Everything in this movie works perfectly! A good story, a blazing pace, a sense of humor, good performances, lots of action, and one of the best scores ever make this one of my all time favorite movies. Peter Weller's performance is great and Kurtwood Smith is one of the best villains ever! This was Paul Verhoeven's first and best American Movie. Made for only 13 million, it offers more bang for your buck than countless other huge budgeted movies. Watch it and see what I mean. The two sequels are alright, but can't even compare to this one. Many people want a fourth Robocop to be made, but why? They should have only made one in the first place! Either that or handled the sequels better. A true action classic that works on many other levels." "Robocop is a very violent movie, which is not for the fainthearted, but it's done so in a Troma film-like way. A Detroit cop is nearly killed in the line of duty and brought back on foot by cyborg-like technology. When he gets his original memory back he vows revenge on the sadistic psychopaths that shot him (Kurtwood Smith, who wastes his talent on \"That 70s Show\" played one mean bad guy here.) The plot is meat and potatoes but it becomes more of a satire on the corruption and imperialistic ways of capitalism. Total Recall, which was directed three years later by Paul Verhoeven, has that same kind of satire. A classic film, and if you have an action movie collection, this movie should be in it." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "My first comment posted on imdb was for RoboCop, but all it said was to avoid \"RoboCop 2.\" Looking back, that seemed like a pretty lame way to comment on \"RoboCop,\" my favorite movie of all time. I hereby present the following, more relevant review: \"How can your favorite movie be RoboCop?\" I get that question a lot now, it seems. I'm not sure I want to write some kind of terribly detailed explanation of why this is my favorite movie of all time. Quite simply, everything in the movie works for me. To therefore try to explain what I like about the movie would equate to me writing about why a joke is funny when someone didn't get it. However, I'll give an effort here. I'll go ahead and state two main reasons on why I like the movie that most other fans of the movie probably didn't already state, such as the notion that it is a great satire of the corporatization of America, that it is ultra-violent and therefore cool, or that it works great as a bleak near-future sci-fi comedy. I didn't really dwell on those things when I saw this movie the first few times. So what did I like about it? SPOILER ALERT First of all, it is an extreme movie, but unlike many movies the extremeness works in this case. I felt the lowest point of disgust, the most uncomfortable fear, the highest thrills of triumph, moments of sadness, and moments of hilarity. The execution of Alex Murphy is one of the most horrifying things I had ever seen. I felt sooooo bad because of what happened, but this was brilliant on the part of the filmmakers because it made RoboCop that much more fun to root for, and it made his revenge that much sweeter. RoboCop then exists to counter all the woes we can experience. One very scary scene to me is the one where Emil threatens the college boy at the gas station (for anyone who's ever been behind the counter in a store, this scenario is dreadful!). It's even scarier than the scene where the armed robber holds up the mom and pop store, because in the other scene you know what Emil is capable of. Anyway, in both cases, out comes RoboCop to put the fear back in to the criminal. Elsewhere, RoboCop experiences deep loss because he has lost his past life, and for him to slowly realize that was very sad to me; he slowly finds out that he has lost his life and has been turned into a programmed robot. The scene where he revisits his house really made me sad; no one else gets a chance to come back from the dead and see what has happened since he had died and what he has lost because of it, and no one ever should. Therefore it's another joy to watch him triumph beyond that as well, as he starts to regain some semblance of free will and identity (and, thus, end the movie on a high note when he answers the question of \"What's your name?\" with a self-assured \"Murphy.\"). Add to that the satirical humor littered throughout the movie (the corporate cutthroats, the stupid \"I'd buy that for a dollar!\" guy, the news briefs), and it's got all the ingredients to touch every emotion: anger, pity, elation, laughter. Second of all, to put it quite simply: RoboCop is just plain cool! I loved comic book-style heroes, but to me RoboCop was the ultimate comic book hero. He's a cyborg, and he doesn't look cheesy, he looks slick (having become a fan of Transformers and RoboTech, a cyborg could easily get on my good side). He's got a huge gun that he can holster in his leg. He has great comic hero lines (\"Your move, creep!\" \"Dead or alive, you're coming with me.\" \"Come quietly or there will be... trouble.\"). And best of all, he's practically invulnerable! Poor helpless Murphy gets wasted by one of the most evil gangs of villains you've ever seen; they toy with him and laugh at his slaying. Then he comes back and they can't touch him. In the cocaine factory, he takes them all out, one shot at a time. He throws Clarence Boddicker (to me, the most evil slimeball villain ever; hats off to Kurtwood Smith!) through several windows and barely holds back from strangling him... with ease. The bad guys can't stop him, and in the final showdown, they come somewhat close, but you always know that they don't really have a chance. And these bad guys get it but good in the end. Of course, the worst is Emil's toxic waste death. How many murderers would you like to see get taken out like that? Anyhow, I loved RoboCop as a comic hero and a movie hero. Because you know what happened to him, you root for him all the way, from the moment he is being built to his final showdowns with Clarence and Dick Jones. So many other things are cool in the movie: how RoboCop takes out the rapist, the stop-motion ED-209, the little goofy commercials, the supporting cast which includes Murphy's partner Lewis, Sgt. Reed, RoboCop creator Bob Morton (go Miguel Ferrer, another actor whose specialty is slimeballs!). This is a spectacular entry into sci-fi, and was every much as big in the '80's as other sci-fi greats like Aliens, Terminator, and Predator. But in those movies, the good guys were always disadvantaged. Not so with RoboCop. \"Go Robo!\"" "Add another review" "Find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your Watchlist and rate your favorite movies and TV shows on your phone or tablet!")("Movies, TV & Showtimes" "Celebs, Events & Photos" "News & Community" "Watchlist" "" "Find industry contacts & talent representation" "Manage your photos, credits, & more" "Showcase yourself on IMDb & Amazon" "Sign in with Facebook Other Sign in options" "Own the rights?" "I loved this film ever since I first saw it back in the 80s, but it has so many levels that you notice when you go back and watch it time and time again. A future where Corporations run America is nothing new in films, but where Robocop differs is the fact its very believable. What this movie does is to take privatization one step further by showing a future where the police force of Detroit being privatized by the mega corporation OCP. Its over the top violence shows us just how fragile and meaningless human life can be, in a future where anyone can die in a second and no one is safe. At the same time, although violent it has an almost humorous undertone to the whole thing. Its media-break segments break up the film nicely, and provide the extra narrative to push the story along, without wasting time on needless dialogue which would have only bogged the film down. Our hero Alex Murphy played by Peter Weller doesn't have as much to do in the second half of the movie for obvious reasons, but brings very human qualities to Robo. While Kurtwood Smith is excellent as uber-villain gang boss of old detroit. Anyone who has seen this movie should go and buy the directors cut dvd, which adds more violent scenes which were cut out to avoid NC-17 rating only adds to the film greatly. The Commentary track on the dvd also provides huge insight into the film and story giving so many more opinions which would never have come from just straight watching the film. This is an all time great movie, and should belong on any serious film collectors shelf. Paul Verhoeven once said the thing he regrets most in his career is not taking directing duties on Robocop 2, and it shows as this is a far superior film. The Sequels get more inferior as they go on, and the series is so bad its not even worth the film it was printed on. Ed Neumeier, Jon Davison and Paul Verhoeven work so well as a team as they repeated in the also excellent Starship Troopers, but this, their first film is by far the best, go out and watch it again now!" "I saw this movie recently and I have to say, this movie ROCKED. The uniquely written storyline was excellent, the special effects great, and Peter Weller's portrayal as RoboCop\\Alex Murphy was great. Also, I was blown away by the relentless use of the \"f-word\" and the extreme violence present in the film. Let's face it: Paul Verhoeven created a masterpiece of entertainment." "POW!!!!!! IT'S ROBOCOP!!!..yes the best robo in the world...I Remember,sure i remember...it was 1988 and i saw this movie..LOL...what violence...clarence botker ís a cool bad guy and the scene who botker BLOWS up the heard of murphy's is very cool...Yes this is A CLASSIC CLASSIC,and for the people who don't want to get the PREMIUN VERSION(ALL SCENES,NO CUT) Don't be stuped...it's the best version....R(RATED) KICKED ASS...get the full version [*** / ***] ROBOCOP UP'S!" "Not only is this a brilliant film but it also has the most fantastic music score any film could wish for. Paul Weller plays his part magnificently. There is plenty of violence but not in a gruesome way. Well worth watching if you haven't seen it before. Watch it with the volume RIGHT UP!" "I really love this film. First of all, it has an interesting plot. It's about a police officer who had been shot to death and bring back to life by OCP company. Really interesting. Next, it has a good action scenes. The scene I like best is that Robocop striked the drug lab and when he fought with ED-209. Full of gun firing and explosion. If you like sci-fi movie, it's a MUST-SEE for you." "Robocop cannot be praised enough as it is one of the most original action movies I have ever seen. The film blends violence with humor, something with not all movies can do well. I cannot believe this film was made in 1987 as it still packs a punch. For any fans of Robocop you must purchase the criterion DVD as this is the definitive Robocop and contains the most graphic scenes which were removed to get get an R rating, otherwise it would have got an X. Makes you wonder how violent a film can be to achieve and X rating only for its violence, well believe me when I say this version is very gory. An excellent film." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Why am I writing about RoboCop (1987) in the year 2000? Who will ever read these comments? I just purchased RoboCop on DVD from the Criterion Collection and it still works now as it did then. This is an ultra-violent film in many ways, and then there is humor and hope and justice in it as well. I remember the first time I saw the film. When Murphy gets gunned down by the gang, I was so full of rage it was hard to contain myself. I even felt bad when the young VP gets blown up by Clarence. The character of Clarence Boddiker (sp?) was so truly despicable that I still refer to the actor as \"Clarence\" whenever I see him (e.g. \"That 70's Show\" on Fox) and I shudder. I remember saying, kind of out loud, \"You're fired,\" just moments before it was said in the film. The way the film meted out justice, with its poignant moments and powerful ending, made all of the previous over the top violence tolerable in a way that cannot be said for over-hyped gore fests such as \"Natural Born Killers\" (not to compare the two films, they're vastly different -- but, I'm not a fan of ultra violent flicks. I'll never watch NBK again, because it is so violent and there is no pay back, whereas the bad people in RoboCop definitely get what they deserve. I'm not going to say much about the film here because I think it has so many good points, I could write an extensive essay on it. I give it a 10 out of 10 with the acknowledgment that it cannot be for everyone. I watching the film commentary, I will say that the speakers (director, producer and writer) make mention of something about how this film works as a Sci-Fi movie, which is similar to a comment I made about the recent \"X-Men.\" They say that this film, while in the not too distant future, does not have a lot of surreal or futuristic aspects to it. Basically, they have the robot (ED-209), and RoboCop, and that's about it. It works, because the world they present is not so different from our own. I made the same observation about \"X-Men\" saying that, yes, you have mutants, you have Xavier's school and Magneto's hideaway, then everything else is pretty much as it is in the current world. For both of these films, I thought it strengthened their believability over the comic book world of \"Batman.\" I don't think this is the most powerful observation one can make on this film, but I mention it because it did strike a chord with me as an aspect that can make a film work for a lot of people. If you present it as completely Sci-Fi, or comic book, you shut off a lot of potential audience because there are a lot of people who just aren't going to buy into these alternate worlds. To sum up, if you like RoboCop, watch it again, anytime, and you'll see that you still enjoy it. If you haven't seen it, give it a try, but know that it is violent. If you have a chance to see the Criterion version, check it out and enjoy the extras!" "I think it is superb, verhoven is my favourite director. There is nothing in this movie that I would like to change accept maybe some of the props. I must have seen it about 100 times! It is way ahead of any other movie at the time, has loads of cool one liners effects and story." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "When you hear the title, \"Robocop,\" you instantly think of the countless lame, boring comic-book style films that have been made. However, this is not the case with Paul Verhoeven's breakthrough American film. This is a Frankenstein story set in a crime-ridden world where corporations are buying everyone's future. To say that this movie is ultraviolent is an understatement, but it is greatly out-weighed by the satire. It has references to literature, Vietnam, and the corporate world all wrapped into one spectacular movie. One Murphy is killed by the sadistic drug dealers, you hate them because of their cruelty and brutality; but as the film progresses, you get to know them better, and I actually found them to be pretty funny. That's not to say that I didn't cheer when Robocop blew them away, but you get to realize that they have personality. It's the character development like this that is just one of the many key elements of this film. This is a must-see for all movie go-ers. However, stay away from the sequels; they turned Robocop into what is was never supposed to be; a lame, boring comic book story." "I first saw this movie back in 1989 in south Spain, My view it's the best sci-fi action movie of the late eighties. It has all the settings of a good sci-fi movie, dark futuristic atmosphere, violence, great action scenes, good synth music, harsh gritty language, great climaxes and atmospheric unforgettable scenes, and not to mention great special effects, including the gore scenes. It was followed by two extremely bad sequels. The old coin-up arcade game, was also great fun! They dont make them like this anymore 8/10 points!"

"Next to Terminator, Robocop is the best \"indestructible robot\" live action movie. This movie is never dull, which is what you might expect from a movie like this. The good thing about this movie is instead of showing Robo killing people for an hour, you see how he comes to be, and still has some human qualities. The robot suddenly remembers having a wife and kid, and is curious to learn more. There are good action sequences, which shows how Robocop processes and reacts(like his targeting systems, modes, even the dreaded violations, which results in shutdowns). But by the end of the movie, the \"machine\" is more human than ever, knowing what not to do, and naming itself after the officer who \"it\" once was. Think about it, good movies is where you find this." "I have the Directors cut of Robocop at home. It has SO much blood!! I actually laughed when Ed-2O9 shot that OCP guy because there was so much blood that it was ridiculous! Man, dont let your little kids see the Directors cut. Other than the extra scenes the DVD had, the movie and plot is still classic. I didnt feel sorry for the bad guys (the ones that killed Alex Murphy) Robocop killed no matter how brutally he was doing it. They got what the deserved. Great movie! Part 2 was really good too, but stay away from 3." "Robocop is the story of a man whose identity is stolen. Although hysterical at times, and intentionally asks you to suspend reality, the plot is as deep as you want it to be. Simple good guy, bad guy movie....... or a story of how the establishment denigrates the value of the individual in order to meet its greater need. Easy to watch, lots of guys to like or hate, Murphys struggle to regain his \"self\" is there all along. More than meets the eye........as Emil says,\"I like it!\"" "RoboCop is perhaps my favorite of all movies. It's a dark, and darkly humorous, modern sci-fi classic, much deeper in pathos and drama than a film with a comic book name like \"RoboCop\" would lead you to believe. The bad guys are over the top and the hero is worth rooting for. The main thing I just wanted to say is: Don't listen to the \"recommendation\" to see RoboCop 2!!! Done by a totally director and group of writers, it doesn't have the soul-driven touch of Paul Verhoeven, nor the wry humor of the Miner and Neumeier, and is, quite frankly, an awful awful movie. You're better off watching reruns of the RoboCop tv show on the Sci-Fi channel because that series is actually created by the original writers and it ignores the events of any of the RoboCop sequels." "This movie was so cool! Fully packed with action and fun! This movie's got it all, from gas stations blowing up to a guy melting after a toxic waste bath. Robocop is just so cool, he's like a walking wrecking crew. This movie had a good plot, great characters, solid acting a lot of one liners and funny scenes. Good job by Weller, I especially like how he handled the two guys harassing the girl. Peter Weller probably does a mean robot on the dance floor!" "as far as sci-fi/action movies go, this one is a work of pure genius. i still haven't seen any film since come close to the hybrid of extreme graphic violence and dark humor that this classic combined so seemlessly and effectively. the basic plot involves a good cop who is viciously shot down in the line of duty and resurrected from death's door as the cyborg Robocop. the violence in this film is extreme and graphic (the X-rated director's cut is even bloodier!) but isn't sold as exploitation. the movie is never meanspirited in it's tone and the humor elements elevate it to something other than a gore fest. the special effects, particulary the brilliant stop motion animation by f/x genius Phil Tippett, are fantastic and much better than the CGI effects that have become so commonplace in today's market. Director Paul Verhoeven brings the perfect touch to this material. the non-Verhoeven directed Robocop 2 was particulary mean and lacked the cool and quirky touch he brings to his films (such as Starship Troopers). the editing is also fluid and helps amplify the action scenes. the only thing that is a slight letdown is the ending, but after the energy expended in the other sections of the film, this fault is acceptable and doesn't detract TOO much. a violent classic that has yet to be equaled. rating:9.5" "This movie rocks. This is one of the best Sci-fi action movies ever...it's even better than The Matrix. Peter Weller gives a gripping performance as Alex Murphy, a maverick cop who gets gunned down in the line of duty and is resurrected by a shady Industry as Robocop, the ultimate crime fighter. But when his memory begins to resurface, he sets out on a do-or-die mission of vengeance and justice. Loaded with great action sequences and unexpectedly moving, this film is a true epic." "I was very excited when I had the opportunity to watch this film on TV. I was so interested and fascinated in the \"robocop\" idea. Yes, it was a confusing and fascinating idea. \"The Old Detroit\" has been covered by the shadow of crime, its police department has been losing cops everyday, now they are about to strike, and even worse, the police are run by a corporation called OCP. Dick Jones (Ronny Cox) of the company has a cyborg cop plan- Ed 209, which is a failure and Jones is in fact secretly connected with the head criminal of Old Detroit, Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith). Meanwhile, Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer) who also works for OCP, who is young, ambitious, has another better project about building a part human, part machine cop. \"Now we're waiting for a foolish volunteer\", he says. Officer Alex J. Murphy (Peter Weller) has been just transferred from the south precinct to the west precinct and becomes the partner of Officer Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen). While chasing a group of bank robbers they goes to a steel factory, Lewis is hit and faints, and Murphy is savagely shot dead by the gangsters. His body is being used by OCP and he becomes the half man, half machine \"robocop\". Apparently robocop seems to be a better kind of police officer to \"uphold the law\" and to \"protect the innocent\" in the future, but as a matter of fact, he is only a tool for the corporation to pursue more power. The part which \"robocop\" goes back to Murphy's home really moved me. He realizes that the house is empty and his wife and son are gone (Obviously the people in charge haven't blanked his memory successfully). All in all there are a lot of stunning action scenes in this film (Although I still don't understand why those people want to make a part human robocop instead of a complete robot). And I feel truly sorry for Murphy's pathetic fate. Nancy Allen as a sympathetic police officer who helps Murphy rediscover who he really is." "This movie is in with other classics such as with Aliens and The Terminator movies. A science fiction action movie about the near future when the police force is run by corporations. The film is funny with lots of great one liners like \"Dead or Alive, your coming with me.\" It also makes fun of stuff like cars with awful gas mileage. The 6000 SUX. :) Unfortunately, that is not far from the truth. Featuring great special affects for then, they are now cheesy and outdated, but it really dosen't matter that much. This is a great classic, and I recommend you see it soon. But be forewarned, it is such a violent movie that it was first rated X, for violence. There is hardly any sex in it. Someone gets run over, stabbed, it's all in there. Just imagine the Matrix with blood and guts. Then your getting the idea.." "Before FIGHT CLUB satirized the corporate gluttony of America, the last great movie to hold a mirror up to American society was ROBOCOP, and a great many people hate this movie, because it's a satire about our commercial and material-obessed culture. For example: ED 209 pokes fun at overpriced military weapons systems that don't work, its just an excuse to spend money, because if the military doesn't spend all of their alloted budget, then they don't get the same amount of money to work with. The SUX 6000 car that gets 6 miles to the gallon or something like that needs no explanation! \"Does it get cruise control?!?\" Don't forget the infamous TV commercials for the heart transplant machine and the \"nuke 'em\" home game. The efforts of OCP to tear down old Detroit, i.e. the mostly minority inhabited inner city is a perfect example of what happened in New York City around Times Square. The Mayors office would like you to believe they cleaned up the city, but homelessness, prostitution and drug use are as rampant as ever, they've just gotten better at hiding it, much like the \"Silver City\" of Robocop was really nothing more than a very expensive paint job. What's brilliant about Robocop is that they've managed to make a smart, funny movie all the while incorporating great action sequences. A movie like this doesn't work without over the top villains, and Ronny Cox and Kurthwood Smith are happy to oblige, and to a more sinister, subtler extent so is the great character actor Dan O'Herily."

"This is probably the most daring Hollywood film of the last 20 years, but the success of its method is questionable. It attempts to expose the fascism inherent in modern American life. This is an admirable aim. The method it uses though is equally fascist. On the one level it succeeds - we are left in no doubt that there's something rotten in the state of Denmark. There are some brilliant, if obvious, observations about post-modernism, corporate greed, and Cronenbergian man/machine erotics. But the actual plot and sensual pleasure of the film is quite fascist too, and I certainly didn't feel enough distance from my pleasure and the implications of it. Of course, that is my fault. Whoops." "Despite being an ultra-violent sci-fi action picture with comic-book violence and dark humorous overtones, the storyline in RoboCop is almost Shakespearian in style. The plot is a vague retelling of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein with a computer-age twist. The late Officer Alex Murphy returns as a cybernetic revenant to avenge his own murder, and at the same time struggles with his own monstrous nature. I rank RoboCop among the top 10 science fiction films of all time for its poignant if unsubtle social commentary on the 80s, its storyline, and of course, the special effects. The acting is effective for the genre. Kurtwood Smith is outstanding as the evil gang leader. Most of all I liked RoboCop because it is the only time I can remember actually being scared in the theater. It scared me even more the second time I saw it even though I knew what was coming. A word about the violence: This may be the most violent film ever made. I understand that when the MPAA originally rated it, it received an 'X' rating -- the first film ever to get an 'X' rating for *violence*. A few scenes got clipped to get down to an 'R', but those scenes are restored in the director's cut. I think this is Verhoeven's masterpiece, and I'm proud to have it in my collection." "When i first watched this film it was in the same league as \"THE TERMINATOR\" and still is its an action packed vision of the future run by evil buisness men its got humor and the catchy one liners, some bits in gore especially the dvd which has everything and the feel sorry for the cop bit aswell as he regains his past memories and the short evil bad guy with his gang. It was followed by an ok sequel a bad prequel and an even worse tv series but i strongly recommend you see this film." "A good sci-fi movie that takes a satirical view of the corporate world and the sad direction our society is taking. This movie did seem too violent at times (like when Murphy gets blown to bits at point blank range) but I have to say this is one of my favourite movies of all time. It would be sweet to see this movie's special FX redone with todays CGI tecnology. I found the robot special FX blah but for its time I suppose it was good. The story though was top notch. I also found the \"I'll buy that for a dollar\" spoof pretty comparable to some of todays crap like jerry springer, etc etc. Just another example of where our society is heading I suppose." "RoboCop is a great film. The other two Robo-films don't come close to the original. Probably still one of the darkest, most violent movies I have ever seen - yet its still rather charming. The dark humour and one-liners are movie magic. Rent this film, its a classic. *****" "Robocop is a great movie which you already know i think. Well, anyways I this movie is even better on dvd. More overkill yes a quality that made the movie so good. This movie is well acted and has a good plot which is rare for and action well scfi/action movie i guess youd call it but i was surprised i was expecting a shoot em up bang action movie but what i got was a masterpiece." "Robocop is just one of those movies you will never get tired of. It established Paul Verhoeven, my favorite director, as a Hollywood filmmaker, and gave the US a taste of the Dutch director's style. The whole recklessness of it all appeals greatly to me, and that is why this is on my top ten action movie list of all time, it's great! The SFX are mind-blowing, especially for 1987! The only criticism I have of the film, is that the really cool scenes all happened in daylight. There weren't any exceptionally exciting action scenes at night, and you have to have one of those in a great shoot-em-up these days. All in all, this is a great movie, with a little bit taken from the Terminator, but a great plot of its own, and enough blood to fill two movies. Oh, yeah, almost forgot. \"Dead or alive, you're coming with me,\" is the greatest one-liner ever; in any movie! Peter Weller is perfect as Robo, and Ronny Cox the perfect 'behind it all' bad guy. Thumbs way up!" "This is probably the best robot film of all time, I just kept laughing the whole movie. When Kenny gets shot by ED-209, when Murphy gets killed, when the thug gets shot in the groin, they were all great death scenes. I couldn't stop laughing when Clarence said, \"Well, give the man a hand!\" after he blew Murphy's hand off. Kurtwood Smith played the best villain I have ever seen in a movie. Right down to the beady little glasses it reminds me of Hitler. The only problem I have is the plot holes in it. What was the purpose of the food Robocop was supposed to eat? He doesn't have a butt now, so how is he going to crap it out? I sure hope it doesn't build up in his stomach and when he is saying a criminals rights it comes out of his mouth like vomit. Another plot hole is the skin on Robocop's head. Since Robocop isn't really a living thing, wouldn't the flesh rot after a while? I sure hope they keep a bottle of fly spray in the police office. The last problem I have is how did Robocop remember his former life? Didn't they blank his memory? They probably hit his head with a hammer and said, \"That's it!\"" "For all its almost cartoonish violence and grim theme, RoboCop is an extraordinarily prescient satire of the levels to which society can, and in some cases already has, degenerated. From runaway corporate greed to preposterous three-shift-class cocaine processing plants, RoboCop only missed becoming a seminal warning piece because far too many people were satisfied with it as merely an action film. Nonetheless, repeat viewings only strengthen this film, and make its sequels that much more tragically bad. \"I'd buy that for a dollar!\"" "A truly superb science fiction action movie which has become a modern day classic. ROBOCOP centres around a police officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) in Detroit in the not so distant future who is brutally gunned down and later rebuilt as a cyborg by OCP (the company who 'owns' the police) as part of an experiment. As well as an original idea, a good cast and admirable special effects (for 1987) the film also has a strong story to it. Weller is okay in the title role while standouts are Miguel Ferrer as ROBOCOP's creator and Kurtwood Smith who relishes his role as chief bad guy Clarence Bodicker. Absolutely great stuff, however many times you have seen it, it's just a shame that it spawned such awful sequels and a laughably cheap cash in of a TV series. \"Your move Creep..\"" "Add another review" "Find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your Watchlist and rate your favorite movies and TV shows on your phone or tablet!")("Movies, TV & Showtimes" "Celebs, Events & Photos" "News & Community" "Watchlist" "" "Find industry contacts & talent representation" "Manage your photos, credits, & more" "Showcase yourself on IMDb & Amazon" "Sign in with Facebook Other Sign in options" "Own the rights?" "Having recently acquired the director's cut of Robocop. I got a sneaking suspicion that I wouldn't like it half as much as I did when I was 15. I've always defended this story of a future world where even the police force is run by a corrupt corporation. Murphy, a dedicated cop, is killed by a gang of criminals, and his body is soon transformed into an experimental cyborg policeman. But can the corporation who built him totally erase his past? Will the bad guys just keep on getting badder, and will the corporation delve deeper into corruption? I don't think we need two guesses at the answers to these questions! There's something quaintly old fashioned about Robocop. Peter Weller's moral cop/robot reminds me of various figures from old Westerns, but in most other respects the film is very much a product of it's time. The themes addressed are the themes of the 80s - TV, nuclear war, globalisation, urban violence, etc. Watching Robocop again makes you realise that all these issues are still with us - we're just so used to having them presented to us through highly paid spin doctors that we don't see them for what they are. Is Robocop's Omni Consumer Products really so far away from the enormous media and consumer conglomerations that have formed in the 12 years since it was released? As much as Verhoeven would like us to read such deeper issues into the film, it doubtlessly works best on a much simpler level. As an 80s action flick, it has few parallels, being exceptionally well made, exceptionally violent (especially the director's cut) and almost, but not quite, as entertaining as it was when I was 15. The casual blasting away of the bad guys may cause a few fascist, right-wing alarm bells to ring in my head these days, but it's a solid bit of fun while it lasts. The acting is generally decent, and the dialogue passable, but some of the effects seem very dated now - indeed, I seem to recall they looked pretty bad in 1987 too! I may no longer consider it to be quite as important a film these days, but it'll still go down well if I'm in the right mood. And there are many scenes that anyone who sees it will always remember - the melting man anyone? I guess that, had Verhoeven toned down his message and his delivery somewhat, then Robocop may have been just another routine video rental. Maybe his blunt style can be an asset after all...(!)" "When I was younger i had three favorite movies. '' TMN Turtles '', '' Conan '' and '' RoboCop ''. I thought RoboCop was too cool to be true. And i still think so. Complaining about the voilence and the blood is stupid. It's after all a '' Shoot em up-movie '' ( new kind of word ). And this is also a classic movie for every actionfans. I am not an actionfan. I can watch any kind of movie. It could be action, drama, romance, sci-fi, adventure, war movies, you name it. So I give this movie a well deserved * * * ½ out of five and 7 out of 10. '' Dead or alive you're coming with me ''." "RoboCop could have been the start of a great franchise. Instead the brand name piffled-out after the sequel and has since languished in the hell of TV shows, animated TV shows and mini-series crap. Paul Verhoeven's multi-layered original provided a platform for so much potential and possibility, it's a shame we only got 2 good movies out of it. Alex Murphy is a deeply unlucky cop who has transferred into Detroit's (actually Dallas) worst precinct. On his first day on the job he is gunned down by the stupendously evil Clarence Boddicker (a brilliant turn by Kurtwood Smith) and his gang of nasty thugs. Resurrected as some kind of Frankenstien/Christ figure, Murphy returns as RoboCop-The Future of Law Enforcement. In the world of RoboCop big business rules and public servants can be bought as stock (doesn't sound so unrealistic does it?). A super-conglomerate called Omni Consumer Products has entered into an agreement to fund and run the Detroit Police Force. Wishing to create a cop who doesn't need to eat or sleep they have a choice of pursuing the RoboCop idea or going with Vice President, Dick Jones' idea of ED-209, a mech-like twin cannon on legs. The CEO goes with RoboCop, leaving Jones with a personal vendetta against poor Robo. It may have been satire back in 1987 but today we are all to used to doomsday news being delivered by smile by our news anchors only to cut to an ad feature some violent video game or movie. The violence, social commentary and horror of RoboCop can sometimes pale in comparison to real life. When you're 7 years old, RoboCop is probably just the most amazing thing ever. I swear, I must have seen this film about 100 times when I was a kid. I was word-perfect on it. Even erm...note-perfect on Basil Poledouris' awesome, awesome score.I guess it's kind of unfair on kids these days that they are raised on braindead PG-13 crap while I got one bloody action movie after another back in the 80s. RoboCop is no doubt a classic. It's a shame it had such an indignant death. Still, I guess this is still a chance for re-resurrection. But please...no remake!" "Robocop is a great sci-fi movie. It has lots of blood in it. The acting is great. The story is great. The special effects are great. This movie kicks a**! Robocop never showed mercy to his enemies in the warehouse scene. The movie has great bad guys. Get it for DVD." "All cinema lovers get to place one guilty pleasure on their all time favourites list. Robocop is mine. Here we have a violent sci-fi film, steeped in self-parody, which still gives us one of movies great villains. No action flick works without a convincing villain and Kurtwood Smith's turn as Clarence Boddicker is perfect. He portrays a career criminal who sells drugs because its a business - he makes no other pretense and the movie does not waste our time trying to show his tortured past or making him into a closet junkie. More than anything, Robocop is a satire. The movie paints this bleak futuristic world (although we are never told that it is in the future) punctuated with sugar-coated \"everything's A-OK\" news casts and TV commercials for artificial heart transplants and a board game called Nuke'em. The entire premise of \"OCP\", the company who has privatized just about every not-for-profit public service, is far-fetched. But it works because the viewer can envision it happening, and because the movie drops you unabashedly into this incredible world. Also pay close attention to the old DOS commands that are displayed when the camera views from inside Robocop's visor. Its a throw-back to the first PCs. Director Paul Verhoeven fills the screen with so many wonderful enjoyable images, and works a plot so subtle that you may well miss most of the symbolism the first time around. This is a movie worth viewing over and over. The only knock on this film for me is that is gave way to two of the most horrid sequels ever made. Avoid them at all costs. **** out of ****." "I have a special place in my heart for mid-to-late eighties actioners (Predator, Beverly Hills Cop, Midnight Run, Commando, Lethal Weapon, Die Hard etc.) - they don't make them like they used to. For some reason, late 90s actioners are so lame and trepid - like Speed 2, Daylight, Cliffhanger, Lethal Weapon 4, Twister, GoldenEye etc. Bring back McTiernan, Shane Black, Tony Scott (Enemy Of The State leans too much onto the spy side of things) and let's not forget Paul Verhoen, whose RoboCop is a defining eighties actioner. What separates RoboCop from most other actioners is the world it's set in, in the 'near' future. It's not typically post-apocalyptic or terribly grim as most films show it to be, but shown to be PURELY run by money. It's a place where big corporations run the public services, and let criminals do as they please - like a never-ending riot. The situation is so extreme, you have newsreporters making fun of some of their stories - like a crisis in a third world country. To the hardcore shoot 'em up fan, one would probably not notice this as I had on first viewing, but it proves to be a thought-provoking setting and situation. RoboCop has a great cast. Ronny Cox and Miguel Ferrer are absloutely superb as rival business executives of OCP, a big corporation whose moniker and logo are seen throughout the film frequently since this is the company that owns EVERYTHING. The rivalry is so well played out, though I don't think it has much to do with the chief plot. Weller, whose full face is rarely seen in the film, does a good job as RoboCop/Alex Murphy. The shootouts, which are pretty much all the action scenes, are well choreographed and entertaining. I especially like the scene in which RoboCop marches into a warehouse, taking out badguys left, right and centre. And his one-on-one with ED-209 robot. Finally, I must confess that the ED-209 law enforcement unit was one of the scariest things I'd ever seen. With a horrifying montonous tone and a facist programme of operation, I really was scared in seeing it mercilessly shoot a junior executive to smithereens. The line - 'YOU HAVE FIFTEEN SECONDS TO COMPLY' - I shiver in fear when I hear that. I have a fascination for eighties films - especially ones that are action and 'very eighties' and so I love RoboCop." "Robocop is Paul Verhoeven's best film! Truly exciting, funny, dramatic, and action packed. Thankfully, now there is a director's cut on laserdisc and DVD, which has restored cuts which were removed to avoid an X rating. I watched it, and personally, I think the MPAA was very uptight in their decision. The cuts desperately needed to be there. The overall feeling and impact was changed to what it needed to be. For example, in the scene where police officer Murphy was murdered, he seemed just like an unlucky victim to a \"firing squadron\". In the director's cut, it is almost painful to watch! It not only makes his death memorable and pitiful, but it throws a dark shadow over the film that never leaves you. Even when Robocop was in the stages of being built, that murder scene was always in the back of my mind. It was so much more powerful, and set up a conflict between Murphy and the criminals which pays off at the end of the film. The director's cut isn't even a minute longer than its predecessor, and yet, it is a stronger version of the movie. It's great! But beware, it's not for the squeamish! Those of you who have seen the director's cut know exactly what I'm talking about." "Despite yet more blood guts and violence from Paul Verhoven, I was stunned when I first saw Robocop. At first I was captured by the non-stop violence but on more recent viewings I am caught deep in the storyline about a cop who has his life ripped from him and replaced by that of violence. I think people should forget Verhoven's reputation of sex and violence in his films as they are just his way of portraying an amazing story." "Called by Ken Russell \"the greatest science-fiction film since Metropolis,\" controversial director Paul Verhoeven's ROBOCOP is a special effects-laden cult phenomenon. The film features a resurrected and roboticized hero in a new, supercharged cyborg body, struggling to reclaim his memory and avenge his own death.Robocop looks into the future with a combination of fear and humor. It is a world clearly projected from the time it was made--the excessive 80's--and gives us a place where corporations control everything, even the public departments like the police. Cops no longer serve the public, they are pawns in a corporate game.Paul Verhoeven did a modern classic and a staple of science fiction. This movie is reckless disregard for human life and public property but still a great action-sci-fi classic and if you like Paul Verhoeven works do not miss this one......" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "If you revisit some of the sci-fi movies of the Seventies and Eighties like \"Star Wars\" and this one, you realize just how clunky some of the special effects were. As an example, you would think the designer of an attack droid would have given some thought to the idea that maybe it would eventually encounter a set of stairs at some point. When that attack droid flipped and started flailing it's legs it looked just hilarious. So it's 2014 now, some twenty seven years since this movie came out, and old Detroit still hasn't been replaced. You'd think they would put a whole army of Robocops in there to straighten things out. Actually, the way things are going, we may not be far from it what with flying drones being unleashed across the country and government surveillance at an all time high. Sure wish we could turn that clock back. Well I saw this when it first came out and again just the other day. Not much has changed in my perception of the flick; it's an entertaining blend of sci-fi and action with all manner of corporate outlaws looking to make a score with the latest in technology. Peter Weller is outstanding in the Robocop get-up, I was particularly amused each time he did one of those awkward twists with his head to signal a new direction he was going in. Ron Cox was perfect as the number two man at Omni Consumer Products, but he probably should have thought things through a bit more with his programming team. If all it took to get knocked out of the picture was getting fired, why wouldn't he simply design Robocop not to harm him under any circumstances. Pretty simple solution really. Say, how did the Robocop armor get fixed up every time he got shot up? That's what I'd like to know."

"In the last several years, Hollywood has made a habit of remaking, 'sequeling', 'prequeling' and rebooting anything they can get their greedy hands on. These unnecessary spin-offs rarely work as quality movies, but apparently they are very profitable. Long story short, this year (among other things) we will get a remake of the 1987 Action/Sci-Fi classic RoboCop. Although I strongly oppose remaking RoboCop (but I oppose remakes in general), this review wasn't meant to serve as criticism of the remake, but as a look back to, and a glorification of, the original movie. I will be tackling the remake when it is released, of course. In spite of being considered a classic action movie today, back in the day almost every big director passed on the opportunity of directing RoboCop  before Paul Verhoeven eventually settled as the director; and he also would have passed the opportunity if it weren't for a pleasant turn of events of his wife reading the script and convincing him to direct it. The reason I'm mentioning this is because Paul Verhoeven is the ideal director for such a movie, and if it weren't for him, I doubt RoboCop would have achieved the cult status it has. But I'll get to that in a moment. 'RoboCop' is set in a futuristic/dystopian version of the city of Detroit, which has a big problem with crime, and the police can't seem to do a thing. The police's main problem is one Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith), who is a notorious cop killer and the crime boss of 'Old Detroit'. Besides him, the police has trouble dealing with Omni Consumer Products (OCP), a company which signed a contract with the city that puts them in charge of controlling the city's security and police department. As an attempt at decreasing the city's crime rate, OCP has been developing some weapon programs  amidst which is a certain Robocop program, that would create a cyborg super cop who could easily deal with the troublesome crime rate. Luckily for them, a cop named Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) gets killed on duty, and they decide to run the prototype of the Robocop program using his dead body. To be honest, the concept of the movie does sound a bit ridiculous (which might explain why everyone passed the opportunity of directing it), but that's exactly why Paul Verhoeven is the perfect choice for directing it. He easily manages to turn the source material upside down and create something that is, at the same time, excessively violent, funny and satirical. And in that way 'RoboCop' isn't much different from Verhoeven's 1997 underrated gem Starship Troopers. His subtle director trademarks (the commercials in the movie and the religious imagery) are precisely what makes 'RoboCop' a good movie that stands out from other/similar action movies. Furthermore, Verhoeven directing is absolutely brilliant (the scenes in which RoboCop gets revealed come to mind) and he puts just the right amount of excessive, sometimes cartoonish, violence in the movie, in order not to avoid the campiness of the movie's premise. All of this makes 'RoboCop' a very unique and enjoyable experience which wouldn't have been possible without Verhoeven. Of course, not all of 'RoboCop' is Verhoeven's one man show. Props should be given to the people who designed the suit and to Kurtwood Smith, who plays the villain  Clarence Boddicker. His Boddicker is menacing, unpredictable and crazy, and the rule 'each film is only as good as its villain' undoubtedly works for 'RoboCop'. The only minor flaws that could be attributed to 'RoboCop' are that some of the special effects are really outdated, and that Peter Weller's role in the movie is unusually small, in spite of him being the titular character: he doesn't do much in terms of acting (more flashbacks could have helped with that problem). But I understand that some people may consider these as nitpicks. Finally, just like the old saying goes  'if it ain't broke, don't fix it'. Got that, Hollywood? Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/" "This film from the eighties still packs quite a punch, it doesn't seem to have dated at all; the action is still as exciting as ever and there are still scenes where I want to look away. Set in the crime ridden Detroit of the near future Peter Weller plays Officer Murphy who has just been transferred to one of the roughest precincts in the city. He is partnered with Officer Lewis, played by Nancy Allen. Unfortunately for him he is soon shot and left clinically dead. At this point OCP, a company that is running the privatised police force and has hopes to rebuild Detroit, steps in and replaces most of his body with cybernetic parts and erases his memory. Once back on the job he quickly makes an impression as he apprehends several criminals but all is not working according to OCP's plan as he starts to dream about his past life and then begins to search for those responsible for his death. This film fits in several genres: crime, Sci-fi, action, Dystopia, black comedy... if you are a fan of any it is worth watching, the acting is good through out as are the special effects, no obvious CGI like many of today's films. It is surprising that this isn't as well known these days as films like \"The Terminator\" and \"Die Hard\", I suspect it is due to the fact that the sequels were noticeably inferior to this." "I liked it more as an action movie than a sci-fi satire. The violence was suitably brutal and the action was fairly terrific, but the satiric elements were pretty mild and not as biting as I expected. It seemed to work better as a cheezy B-movie than anything else. Murphy's execution scene could be the most gruesome and horrifying scene I've ever seen, not just because of the gore but because of the context. It just disturbed me, something that doesn't happen a lot. Weller is fine - for a cyborg - but this film is all about Kurtwood Smith. Probably one of the best villain performances ever. The rest of the film is fairly mediocre; on the whole, it's entertaining and quotable, but not really deep or meaningful." "I am a huge fan of Robocop. I was about 7 or 8 when i first saw the films and i loved them and not because of the graphic violence or high levels of swearing! I have continued to watch them to this day and still never get bored of them. Sublime. People often ignore the next 2, they were still mighty fine even if not as good. If you are a true Robo fan, you wont have failed to notice the TV series, which again, will never be a match to the movies, is still top class cause at the end of the day, its Robocop. Its not just the sci-fi or violence, he's a guy with a heart and its the true story and later successes that make the movies what they are. Probably, my favourite line has got to be the famous \"Stay out of trouble\". Peter Weller was just incredible and i would welcome any day a fourth, a fifth and even a sixth. As is said before, its not the violence i liked. At times, particularly toward the latter stages of the picture, it gets quite comical, you know, the bit at the old sludge plant. I actually disliked the extent to which Verhoeven deemed it necessary to portray Murphy's downfall. Nonetheless, there are many clever elements incorporated into Murphy's legacy. These include the supporting cast, the stuff he says and the side issues of the regeneration of Delta City and the idea of Omni Comsumer Products. Its not just a case of cops chasing the bad guys, as Verhoeven was successful in showing. I loved the characters of Sgt. Reed and Mr. Kurt Smith who played a very believable fugitive in a corrupt Delta City. Finally, the ending \"Nice shooting, what's you're name\" and Robo replies with Murphy before closing on the end credits, with some of the greatest ever movie music ever, by Basil Poledouris. Absolutely Superb!" "Robocop is every man's fantasy film. We have action, gore, boobs, car chases, and some comedy thrown in. Peter Weller is great as Murphy, the cop who gets wasted by Clarence (Kurtwood Smith who looks like Lee Bowles) and turned into Robocop. It would have been nice to see Karen Allen naked but alas she isn't. Check out Carrie if you want to see her wool (I'll buy that for a dollar!). Get the unrated version of Robocop so you can see all of Rob Bottin's excellent make up effects." "Let me just say, I like this film alot, but there are some problems I have with it. First of all: I would have liked to see Murphy more as a human. We dont get to see him much that way. It would have been nice, if the story had taken the time needed to show us more of Murphys life as a human. It would have been better. The other problem I have is Murphys death. What leads up to it, two cops dumb enough not to wait for backup and go in to take on a large number of triggerhappy badguys, that alone is unbelievable. And Murphy calling Clarence slime, when he got 5 or 6 men pointing guns at him, seems pretty dumb too. Hes asking for it. But stil, the way they keep on shooting him over and over again. And it never seems to end. Of course in real life he would have been dead on the floor, long before they had run out of ammo. Before Clarence blew his brains out. Nobody can survive to be shot that many times. But the way he stands there and screams in pain as they just pump him full of bullits. Its too much and unnessecary. Of course, every time he kills one of the psychoes that blew him away, it feels really good, but they could have killed him in a less violent way. If instead they had just beat him up and then shot him in the head instead, then it would have been easier to watch. If not, at least Lewis could have shot the badguys. Or some of them. They never bothered to kill her before they left and they knew she was there. She might not have made it, but she could have saved Murphys life. Also, the movie never deals with Murphys life as a machine. Imagine waking up and your body is gone. Its been replaced by a mechanical body. Youve lost your penis. You can never make love to a woman again, you can never even have a girlfriend. Murphy has lost his body, his wife and his son. And probably his relatives too. And it never makes him lose his mind. That he doesnt kill himself is unrealistic. I know this movie is not suppose to be taken seriously, but it does deal with Murphys loss. And yet, it doesnt deal with it enough. It would have been interested if they had made a different movie where Murphy does get shot, but survives after surgery. A regular copmovie where he goes out with Lewis and kills all the men that shot him. Or they could have made Lewis into Robocop and Murphy as her human partner." "The 1980s had more bad science fiction movies than I can count. Some of these science fiction movies were bad and yet entertaining while others were just plain bad. ROBOCOP was one of those rare science fiction movies that actually didn't suck. It was good. Really good. It's a movie that I have seen at least ten times and I am proud to say that is one of my favorites. The directing is great, the writing is great, everything about the movie is great. The sequel, ROBOCOP 2, is good, but not quite as good as this one. Avoid the second sequel, ROBOCOP 3, at all costs." "Robocop (1987) was an thrilling science fiction comic book movie from Paul Verhoven. It's also a hard hitting satire at a society driven by consumerism, ultra right wing politics and a collapse from within. Crime is at an all time high,poverty is rampant, the streets are a war zone and the police department is being run by a corporation who only cares about the bottom dollar. During one incident, a decorated police officer named Murphy and his partner were in pursuit of a gang of ruthless bank robbers, during a bloody firefight and encounter Murphy is mortally wounded. Meanwhile O.C.P. is looking to implement their new super cop program but they need a involuntary volunteer for the job. Lo and behold they found one in Murphy. Will he be a successful candidate? Can Robocop do the job? Is there any light at the end of the tunnel? Will Robocop survive the rough streets of Detriot and save the day? Paul Weller stars as Officer Murphy, a candidate chosen to become part of the new Robocop program. Nancy Allen co-stars as his partner, Miguel Ferrer is the head of the project, Ronny Cox is his nemesis and board room rival. Kurtwood Smith is th leader of a gang of psychos and sociopaths. What makes the movie cool is the sheer graphic violence, witty dialog and a bunch of stand out characters. The direction is flawless and the cinematography is top notched. Verhoven and writer Edward Neumeir would work with each other again on the highly underrated science fiction flick Starship Troopers. Both films have the same criticism of conservative governments and societies. They're highly recommended and they can be seen together as companion pieces. Highest recommendation possible!" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This film begins in a dystopian future with the city of Detroit faced with a horrendous crime wave coupled with massive unemployment. As the story unfolds a cop by the name of \"Ajax J. Murphy\" (Peter Weller) is reassigned from one precinct within the city to the most difficult and crime-ridden area of all. To make things even worse a big corporation known as \"OCP\" has essentially taken over control of the police department and virtually dictate all policy and procedures. So when Murphy get shot and killed in the line-of-duty they take his body and transform him into a cyborg which gives him increased strength and gun accuracy but at the cost of a complete loss of memory. Also included in his transformation is a secret protocol known as the \"4th directive\" intended to benefit those within OCP. Although there isn't anything Murphy can do about this his memory begins to return to a limited degree when his partner \"Officer Anne Lewis\" (Nancy Allen) attempts to remind him of certain events just prior to his being killed. In the meantime, however, office politics within the corporation begin to become a bigger problem to Murphy than the armed criminals out on the street. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I remember watching this movie when it first came out and I continue to enjoy it to this day. Of course, it suffers a bit due to the passage of time but that is only to be expected. In any case, I encourage those interested in a movie of this type to check it out and I have rated it accordingly. Above average." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Be forewarned! A lot of blood, gore, bullets and swear words are in this film. That being said, a great concept film later turned into 2 uneven sequels, a 2014 remake, and a somewhat-successful TV series. So many errors and goofs which, for the most part, are mostly \"signage\" problems and techno-issues. I didn't have time to \"catch\" the rest of them as I was too busy watching the film. It is so obvious that this film wasn't filmed anywhere remotely near Detroit. There is even an out-of-state steel mill. Like all Verhoeven films, more big guns than imaginable. The depicted use of \"coke\" is totally inappropriate and the annoying \"I'd pay a dollar for that\" dirty-minded TV video gets old very fast. I love the fake news and tacky commercials. Peter Weller in that tin can suit looks very hot and sweaty! The \"rogue\" cyborg looks stop motion animated but that is before CGI. I am still surprised that there were no laser weapons. Some on the mattes are unconvincing. Somewhat better to watch on cable as the fowl language is greatly cleaned or cut. The acid-dissolving \"henchman\" would give any little kid nightmares. It's convenient that the dirty water dilutes it so that no one else dies that way! I also like (although not as much) Robocop 2."

"*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "The American baptism of Verhoeven is solved with an atypical and violent Sci-Fi film, in which subtle secrets are hidden that can be applied to both political and private organisms. The desire to put into the hands of the machines the security and comfort of citizen security was not a new idea, but the Dutch director knew to give a much more forceful turn in its development, in which the irony is part of a more visceral argument That intellectual. Thus Robocop begins in a future in which violence has reached such a degree that cities choose to delegate private security to citizens, which does not solve the problems of corruption but rather moves them to another area. The idea of ​​the perfect policeman comes from the fusion of what is left of a supposedly murdered policeman with mechanical devices that are supposed to make him invulnerable to criminal attacks. And crime is one of the expositions that best summarizes the film, since crime is directly linked to the corruption of those who are supposed to eradicate it. But it is not all Robocop-Frankenstein, although the director pursues a goal that goes a step beyond the merely commercial, does not turn the film into a trivial moralistic message, but it is a film in which his possible messages do not Interfere with the reality of a science fiction film with great doses of action. Thus, an atypical film was characterized by the insertion of advertising criticizing consumerism and the cold reaction of people to important problems such as pollution, health or ecology, deceitful corporative traps that far from seeking the solution to the social problems benefits from them. We see how the promoter of the first robot uses repressive and uncommunicative methods in the program installed in the machine, which in a first trial ends with the death of an executive whom they treat as if a setback was treated without showing the slightest feeling For the life of the unfortunate director, who the rest of the people urgently request an ambulance, something totally ridiculous after having received a whole countless arsenal of bullets. The creator of Robocop also does not escape the critic Verhoeven style, is a kind of Dr. Frankenstein who does not hesitate to treat a fallen policeman as a product owned by a company willing to experiment with the limits of the human mind, selfish and selfish, Its sole aim is equally the lust for power. \"Robocop\" is a generous film that hides pleasing surprises, which neither adorns violence nor treats it delicately, but shows the wild and selfish side of the times." "RoboCop (1987) is the finest cyberpunk action movie one of my favorite films of all time. I grew up with this movie, it has a special place in my heart and I love it to death. Here you have everything: brilliant story, good actors, stunts, puppetry, models, and good Special Effects. This is Paul Verhoeven and Peter Weller's best movie from the 80's they ever made. I used to had this movie on VHS but over the years the tape was eaten from VHS recorder so that I couldn't watch the movie properly anymore. 3 years earlier I got this movie on Blu-ray Unrated director's cut and my Blu-ray player scratched and eat the Blu-ray disc so I purchased the director's cut again on Blu-ray and I was blown away with the movie how good it is. RoboCop it's not an action in the film itself, that makes this be the case. This is especially odd in a movie with a $50 million budget (in 1987!), with multiple huge explosions, with hundreds of bullets fired, and scores of stuntmen used. 30 year's anniversary is coming in July since the movie was released and it is a shame that Miguel Ferrer aka Bob Morton died this year in January R.I.P. we miss you. This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task. The movie it self has heart and soul in it, the fact is you have a human being who loses his humanity and it brought back to life, he is resurrected and he is a superhuman super cop who once again regains his humanity and his trouble been robot and human. When Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) takes off his helmet we see a sad mourning man who lost everything. I felt really sorry for Alex who was shot and killed I was really moved and sad by his death who lost his family. Peter Weller stars in the film as Alex Murphy, a Detroit police officer who after being gunned down by a vicious gang, is resurrected by a mega-corporation as the cybernetic law enforcement officer of the future. As he begins his new life as \"RoboCop\", Murphy starts to regain a bit of his humanity with the help of his former partner Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen). The popularity of the RoboCop character would spawn a RoboCop franchise consisting of, among other media, two more feature films, a 1994 live-action series, two animated television series, a four-part movie miniseries as well as a 2014 remake. Actors Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, Ronny Cox, Kurtwood Smith and Miguel Ferrer do all job well and they deliver the movie as an entertaining action flick. I love the puppetry of droid ED-209 who has a lot of fire power and the costume and the suit for RoboCop was beautiful designed. Themes that make up the basis of RoboCop include media influence, gentrification, corruption, authoritarianism, greed, privatization, capitalism, identity, dystopia, and human nature. It is an rated R action film and I wish there would be movies like this today. I love the Music score by Basil Poledouris which it is my favorite score and it is a classic orchestra. The stunts are completely insane in scale (we have a lot of glass scenes like Ed-209 fires cannon guns on Robo and he flies trough glass door. Robo fires his gun on Dick (Ronnie Cox) and he flies trough window.) Robo punches a terrorist in mayor's office and he falls from the window. Of course, this wouldn't be an action movie without some action. There's plenty of it, and it's perfectly done. The gunplay is delivered in perfect Verhoeven style (as opposed to the slo-mo John Woo-style) -- you'll see lots of heavy automatic, shotguns and explosive cannon weapons, and you'll see them used well. The film is violent, and bloody with real blood squibs. It is also up to the script to deliver the real substance of the movie. (One often sees great performances in mediocre films... here the story transcends the performances -- an impressive feat.) The script delivers. The film is absolutely filled with great, classic moments (I counted TEN all-star ones during my last viewing), and they're evenly spaced through the movie. I love how RoboCop prevents two armed robberies, a rape which he shoots the rapist in the dick, he bust a drug factory on by him self, he stops and punches a terrorist and saves the hostages in the mayor office, he stops a violent gang by himself and he stops a corrupt business man. Best scene: ED-209 moves its right gun-arm cannon on RoboCop (Peter Weller) but Robo grabs it and shoves it away just before ED fires. ED continues firing as Robo shoves the gun towards ED's left gun-arm, destroying it. ED-209 fires one of its missiles at RoboCop. The missiles were actual rockets guided with wires. RoboCop (1987) is a classic one of the best action films my all time favorite action films of mine that defines my childhood. This movie has a heart, and that you cannot deny. Plus, it simply rocks. 10/10 RoboCop is a 1987 American cyberpunk action film directed by Paul Verhoeven and written by Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner. The film stars Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, Dan O'Herlihy, Kurtwood Smith, Miguel Ferrer, and Ronny Cox. 10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Orion Pictures Starring: Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, Daniel O'Herlihy, Ronny Cox, Kurtwood Smith, Miguel Ferrer, Robert DoQui, Ray Wise, Felton Perry, Paul McCrane, Jesse Goins, Calvin Jung, Lee de Broux Director: Paul Verhoeven Producer: Arne Schmidt Screenplay: Edward Neumeier, Michael Miner Rated: R Running Time: 1Hr. 42 Mins.

And I've never regretted that act of childhood disobedience. The film stars Peter Weller as the leading man/machine/cop and he takes It as the role of a life time. After being nearly killed by a group of criminals lead by Kurtwood Smith's Clarence Bodikker with Ronny Cox's Dick Jones playing Emperor Palpatine to Smith's Darth Vader, he then becomes RoboCop who eventually sets about avenging his own murder. What we then see whilst Murphy kicks ass, killing off criminal after criminal is his journey to finding some humanity again as he ... kills relentlessly. A different stretch of humanity, I'll give you that. But It is superbly cool to see him taking down low life criminals, right up until his most successful death of Bodikker and Dick Jones. What also makes an appearance in RoboCop is ED 209 which is also a bad ass robot, but he's aligned with Dick Jones. And between all of the kick ass action scenes we also get Nancy Allen's Lewis playing Murphy's partner whilst becoming equally bad ass herself. However despite the characters themselves, the highlight of the original RoboCop is definitely the action sequences, a lot of the time It actually feels like you're right there with Murphy as he drives through Detroit dishing out swift justice. To sum RoboCop up I'd have to call It one of my more watched action movies, with a simple but effective collection of elements to go with it." "RoboCop is an all time classic action film and one of the best of the 1980's, right up there with Die Hard in my opinion. Paul Verhoeven's career began here and even though he has made a lot of questionable choices and movies (including some down right stink fests) RoboCop still stands up as awesome. One underrated thing about this movie is Peter Weller's performance, he is great and never really got the credit he deserved for this or a lot of other movies to be honest. At least with Sons of Anarchy he seems to be getting some good work again, which is a good thing. The only downside is this movie is not for everyone, it was originally rated X for a reason and is incredibly bloody and violent, so no kids allowed!" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This is the best tale of revenge ever told - and also a satire about a world where a corporation acts as the State. The premise is that a corporation runs the police - and they make decisions that are based on profit and not public safety. As a result - they want to replace police officers with robots who may be less expensive - and their prototype is Robocop. The problem is - Robocop is really a dead police officer - who after a few successful busts begins to remember how he died and he decides to violate his programming to bring his killers to justice. The film asks- can humanism endure in the face of the State as a machine - when the human in question the machine of the State itself? This movie not only has a rad moral - it has a great soundtrack, groundbreaking violence, magnificent acting, and pristine special effects. The film contains some of the best lines ever delivered on screen - and stands the test of time as a masterpiece. My dad took me to this film when I was seven years old - and I will always remember the impact it had on me. Movies like this never get made anymore. Which is sad." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "I was a teen when Robocop was released in France (january 1988) and i remember to have been a fan with its concept and design while not having seen the movie actually ! I remember also reading the novelization, playing the arcade game and to keep on drawing the character ! But i don't remember how i watched it for the 1st time maybe later with pay TV Canal + and even today with my dad's DVD, it's still a remarkable anticipation movie : in fact, this movie predicted what America has become: cupid firms, silly medias, useless politicians, urban guns violence and devastated districts and for sure, enhanced humans with electronics ! What left me in awe every time i watch it is the quality of this near future (like BTTF2 very likely) and the visual virtuosity to tell the story : Robocop vision, its arrival, its unmasking (like Dath Vader), its dreams, all those moments are really inspired and proves Verhoeven as a highly talented director ! But he is not alone as Weller does a fantastic mime job to act like a robot (with a good help from a handful of TP cast) and Poledouris adds the essential musical soul ! Maybe Verhoeven is a bit too much equating Murphy-Roboop to Jesus but the thematic of the soul in a robot is interesting, all the more put in terms of Police law ! At last, the DVD has really good bonus, in particular the deleted scenes that offers a great alternate ending !" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "What makes this film such a classic is the way in which the standard, clichéd story (itself a mixture of Frankenstein-type moralising with a more teen-orientated shoot 'em up) is given greater depths as characters are fleshed out, given real relationships, and die violently at each other's hands. Director Paul Verhoeven paints a gory, violent depiction of the future, which will come as no surprise for those familiar with the director's mainstream work (namely TOTAL RECALL and STARSHIP TROOPERS). This can only be a plus. There are numerous action sequences in the film and Verhoeven sure knows how to handle the gunfire. As well as the bloodshed, the twists and turns in the plot really add to the intrigue and we even find ourselves caring for the characters as the lines of good and evil are blurred out. Along with the great supporting story, which is kind of a hybrid Frankenstein/revenge film set in the future, there is a powerful, dramatic and pounding score which I really loved. The acting is also good. Peter Weller is very memorable and works wonders in evoking our sympathy, especially as we can only see his lower jaw for much of the film. It's here he proved his worth as a straight lead man. Nancy Allen is quite good as his sympathetic partner, the only person who really understands Murphy. Among the baddies, Kurtwood Smith has playing a callous murderer down to a tee and Ronny Cox emanates pure, sweaty, corrupted greed and evil. The special effects really add to the film in many different forms; ED-209 the stop motion monster is especially impressive, as is Robocop's design (Rob Bottin deserves thanks once again here). Make up is also used effectively. It's interesting to see how Verhoeven uses the recurring theme of satire in his fake news reports, which are very similar to the ones in STARSHIP TROOPERS, and there is even a commercial designed by the insane Chioto Brothers. Along with the action are a number of comedic scenes, the best one being where one of the gang is dissolving in toxic waste before exploding when hit by a car! All of this makes the film well worth watching and it was popular enough to spawn two sequels (the first all right, the second, atrocious) and even a television series, all of which are not as good as the original (but then, when are they?)." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "With the newest remake of this eighties classic action movie been almost forgotten I thought it was high time to review the original splatter that has left such a legacy to our culture. First of all the movie is one of the most violent, vulgar and fun flicks in history and to add to that has a great commentary to the Cold War era madness as well as the total control the corporation have in our life. And all that was in a movie about a cyborg cop in nineteen eighty seven! For real if you seat down and think about it the film kinda predicted correctly the future. Let's see: 1) Corporation getting inside public organizations check. 2) Corporation making great plans with the aid of some unethical persons check. 3) Marketing death and destruction to kids check. 4) The media becoming just a mouthpieces of corporations to sell more and keep the public hooked with stupid cutesy quotes check. 5) Drugs check!!!! 6) Detroit becoming a crime infested area. Holly Batman, they got it quit close to the real deal! I am shocked to say the least by all that facts. In the end a must watch to any man who respect himself!! And for the women who like them , already got my respect!" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Peter Weller's performance goes beyond being in a Robocop costume. He manages to elicit a degree of sympathy, especially in trying to track his wife and son. That was quite moving. The Old Man, who is the CEO of the Robocop company, is played by Dan O'Herlihy, whose son is Gavan O'Herlihy who some may recall played Chuck, the eldest of the three Cunningham children in Happy Days. One standout performance is Paul McCrane, who has a classic scene at the end with the acid vat. Wow, he really lost his head there. Kurtwood Smith is also in Robocop, and he doesn't disappointed. I especially liked Kurtwood's performance in the short film 12:01." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "(Minor spoilers ahead) This movie is a major example of a film that works on almost all levels (but it is not for the squeamish). It works as pure entertainment, a reflection of society when capitalism goes overboard, a thoughtful look into the emotional torment of a man who's had everything taken from him, and a brutal, unforgiving bad ass revenge tale! And boy is that dish served cold! Sometime in the future, Detroit is overrun by vicious criminals. Drugs, prostitution, murder, and injustice are commonplace. Meanwhile, the city is taken over by the suits at OCP, a consumer products mega corporation that manufactures everything from basic consumer items to military weapons and robotics. They've also bought out local law enforcement, leaving many cops at the picket lines since the city owes the company $37 million after a bail out. OCP also secretly works with the city's most dangerous criminals when need be (for something to gain) and are about as corrupt as can be. Seeing as how crime is so rampant and out of control, OCP JR.CEO Dick Jones offers up big bad ED 209, a law enforcement droid who ends up making a bloody mess out of their own at a board meeting in the most extreme bullet ridden kind of way! Upcommer in the biz, Bob Morton sees this as his opportunity to go straight to the head CEO to upstage the seemingly corrupt Dick Jones. Enter Alex Murphy, a good man and heroic cop new to the Detroit metro south police force. Along with his new tough but warmhearted partner Anne Lewis, they are radioed in to go after Clarence Bodicker, one evil and messed criminal and his gang of psychopaths. These guys are some of the most straight up cruel, violet, savage, and vicious villains I've seen on film. After an exhilarating chase, Murphy is tortured, humiliated, and left for dead by the villains. Murphy is later rebuilt by OCP as Robocop. As Robocop he becomes an unstoppable warrior of justice handing out brutality to the brutal and protecting those who cant protect themselves. He slowly starts to regain his memories and goes after the scum who coldly and mercilessly killed him. Usually in movies when a villain brutally harms or kills our protagonist, the vengeance is not often as brutal or satisfactory. This is not the case! The revenge is cold as ice! But Clarence and his thugs are not the only ones. Murphy finds there is more going on behind the scenes then he expected. Can he stop it? How much of him is human and how far can he go? There are few movies I've loved just as much as a kid as I now love as an adult. This is one of the few. It is an incredible film, satisfying on so many levels. Don't let the goofy title or terrible 2014 remake fool you. This is the real deal. Awesome action, great story, and good old fashioned 1980s special effects that look real and not computer generated. Give it a look. You will not be disappointed! Just watch out for that toxic waste, melting scene in the climax. It is disturbing! So if quality action/SciFi cinema is your thing (or not), check this out and enjoy! \"YOUR MOVE, CREEP\"."

"\"B&@$es leave!!\" I direct that sentiment towards anyone out there who thinks the remake of Robocop can hold a candle to Paul Verhoeven's brilliant, incredibly graphic and bitingly satirical 1987 classic. Everything that was special and amazing about the original was absolutely urinated on with the remake, and it kills me that I run into people my age these days who aren't even aware that the remake IS a remake, and think it's the original Robocop. Ugh. Get out. No, this is the real, steel deal, accented by Verhoeven's blunt approach to characterization and overly ultraviolent, near Cronenberg-esque flair for carnage. Peter Weller only gets to act as regular joe police officer Alex Murphy for a brief and chaotic prologue, but makes the most of it with his deadpan delivery and piercing gaze. Murphy is assigned to a precinct in the heart of Old Detroit, a district so corrupt, rotten and infested with crime it literally resembles a war zone, and cops wear heavy riot gear on their beat. Paired Nancy Allen, he beelines it for a suspicious truck leaving the scene of a heist. Only one problem: this particular truck happens to belong to evil arch criminal Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith) and his merry band of psychopaths, who are armed to the teeth with heavy artillery. Cornered in a warehouse, Murphy is brutally, and I mean freaking brutally dispatched by Boddicker and his gang, shredded by a hail of gunfire that turns him into raw hamburger meat. What's left of him is quickly swooped up by corporate, and used in a high tech, absolutely silly program run by coked up suited opportunist Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer). His idea has gotten in the way of nefarious plans put in motion by the top dog of the company, a maniac named Dick Jones played by Ronny Cox in a frighteningly funny turn that makes you terrified in between fits of giggles. Once Murphy has been through Morton's wringer, Robocop emerges, an epic, unstoppable android enforcer who lays waste to criminal scum all over town, until traces of Murphy's consciousness bubble up past the circuit boards and he gets his own agenda. Jones is determind to take him down, along with Morton, undermining The Old Man (Daniel O'Herlihy), the acting CEO. For a film called Robocop that came out in 1987 you'd think were in for a cut and dry action cheese fest. Not with Verhoeven at the helm. The Dutch madman is never one to play it safe (a refreshing trait among European directors) and pulls out all the stops here for a bloody good time that pauses ever so slightly to nudge you with its cynical side that just loves to bash social convention into oblivion. The effects are so 80's you'll swoon, especially when Jones's own robo creation shows up in clanking, drunken stop motion that you can practically reach out and touch. Smith is a homicidal wonder as Boddicker, the smarmy fury and unrestrained behaviour hijacking every scene he's in. Leland Palmer himself, Ray Wise plays Leon Nash, his equally dastardly second in command, and a host of gnarly character actors back them up, all of which have curiously guest starred on Fox's 24 at various points in time, including Weller too. The level of f&@cks given with this film goes into the negative region of the thermometer, and to this day few studio films have been able to boast such disregard for discretion or lay claim to a sheer love of bombastic villains, a blatant lack of subtlety and a willingness to take things to cinematic infinity, beyond and back again just so they can throw a few more bullets into the mix. Accept no substitutes." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Robocop was released in 1987 starring Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, Kurtwood Smith and Ronny Cox. Just like the original Terminator movie this is an amazing movie full of gore and great violence that works in favor of the movie but also a really good script and unique movie for that time Weller as Alex Murphy A.k.a Robocop is really great and totally fits the part but also Kurtwood Smith as Boddiker he's amazing a really great villain and of course Ronny Cox as Dick Jones the actor was meant to play another villain 3 years after this movie was released in Total Recall (1990) directed by Paul Verhoven the director of this movie. The only problem i had with the movie is that in my opinion it's pretty short i wanted more violence and much more action but i'm OK with that and also the ED-209 which is a stop motion when it falls from the stairs it's kinda cheesy. Another great thing about this film is the soundtrack by Basilis Pouledouris which i think is amazing especially when the cops start shooting Murphy that was pretty hard to watch because you feel what the character has been threw loosing his wife, his son, his job but also his humanity. Just like Predator which also came out in 1987 the sequels weren't that awesome but i did liked the Remake it didn't try to copy the movie it was setting a new story and that is what i loved from it. In the end Robocop is easily one of the best movies ever made but also a great action science fiction movie that worked thanks to a talented director, great cast, amazing soundtrack and a very unique script for the time but also for it's R-Rating. P.S: The Trailer for the movie Robocop actually borrowed the theme of The Terminator (1984) and for some reason that was awesome!!!" "\"Robocop\" is a modern science fiction masterpiece. The future is not black and white, as most sci-fi tales conform to. It is a utopia of white-teeth propaganda but its black tarred heart beats a dystopian horror. \"Robocop\" has been misunderstood simply as an eighties violent action picture. It is a lot more than that. Peter Weller is an inspired choice for the dual role of Officer Murphy (married family man, nice suburban home) and his resurrected entity - Robocop. The armor suit is brilliantly created, and seems well ahead of its time - example the gun holster in his leg (this is pre-CGI). Nancy Allen, plays his side-kick who also holds a high moral compass. The story is simple, and therein lies its beauty. Paul Verhoeven is a master at creating visceral Science Fiction worlds brimming with originality, extreme violence, and sharp satirical humor. RoboCop is the perfect example. It is often hilarious, and equally thrilling. The violence is played up to an unrealistic level, making it difficult to take seriously (as you should not), yet even so, it may be a little much for the squeamish. The violence may have been a shocker back then, but by today's standards it's pretty standard, so I feel the over-the-top tone may go over some newer viewers' heads. Overall rating: 9 out of 10." "If a film can be considered perfect based on the presidents that it personally sets out to accomplish and it's achievement of doing so effortlessly, then the original Robocop might be as close to a perfect film as it gets! It knows that it want's to be an over-the-top, comically violent sci-fi action movie with a ridiculous premise, while simultaneously making fun of contemporary American consumerism in the 1980's. And it hits it's mark with precision only Robocop himself could have! The movie provides you with almost no wasted screen time; every scene serves its purpose in developing the story! Even when the action and the plot is interrupted by \"Media Breaks\" and hilarious satirical commercials, it doesn't waste your time and keeps you entertained and immersed in this dystopian view of Detroit. And while the movie is hard to take seriously based on the name and premise alone, it doesn't shy away from providing some very real human moments and deep emotions. The tone of the movie is all over the place, but the tone of each scene is never out of place, and it all seems to fit together. However, be forewarned before going into this film that this movie is excessively violent. It's not violent from start to finish necessarily, but there are scenes of people being shot 60 times in the chest with heavy weapons and a guy who's flesh melts after being drenched in toxic waste (which is arguable the funniest part of the movie). The violence can be a bit much at times, especially when we see the main protagonist brutally tortured with shotguns by a gang of criminals, but most of the scenes are so over-the-top that they become absurd and outright comical! Bottom line: this film earns it's R rating several times over, so be prepared! If you can stomach the ridiculous violence and gore, and can accept this film as what it is, then you will definitely enjoy Robocop! Just know what kind of movie you're getting into first." "This film is comparable to a fine wine or cheese. It gets better the more and more it ages. Robocop is Paul Verhoeven's greatest film (Close second Total Recall) of which both had terrible remakes. If you have not already seen Robocop I highly suggest it if you are a fan of either Total Recall or any good 80s violence fest, such as The Thing. It is no surprise that the ED-209 and Robocop are two icons of pop culture. Not the greatest film ever made, perfect at what it wants to do. Which is a violent crime action film with sci-fi elements. One of the best films to come out of the 80s." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This is a fun film, in the vein of classics like 'The terminator' and 'Total recall', though not that good. The story has some pretty good ideas in it, there's a lot of creative violence and gadgets, and the two leads, Peter Weller and Nancy Allen, really work well together. There's a good load of fun bad guys here as well, one of whom is Kurtwood 'foot in your ass' Smith. At times there are some lesser scenes, for instance, when that gang gets together shooting the really big guns just for fun - they're more like a bunch of kids there. But every time things are about to get a little too boring or too silly, things pick up pretty quick again. The stop-motion parts are a lot of fun as well, as is the (in itself somewhat off-handed) part with the toxic waste crash. As said, the story has some good ideas, but as a whole it wasn't all too convincing. Just a fun '80s sci-fi action ride, that's all - and that's fine! A good 7 out of 10." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Officer Alex Murphy is killed in the line of duty and then re-built by the \"Omni-Consumer-Products\" Corporation as robocop. Part man, Part machine, All Cop. Although released in 1987 it is set in an unspecified future. This movie is chock full of satire about 1980's culture and it has aged very well in my opinion. Sadly many of the attitudes displayed by some of the characters in this film have become true. Highly recommended. This original is much better than the 2014 \"Re-make\". I would have typed everything correctly but IMDb wouldn't allow it. They thought I was yelling. Go figure." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "I have to say, this was a pretty good movie, it wouldn't be a favorite but man, Robocop was a bad ass! I honestly wish I could have a suit like that so I can not worry about being shot by criminals but unfortunately, it's not real so I might as well suck it up to reality! I actually never came across this movie but I have heard of it throughout the years! I probably was the only person in the world to not have seen this since it has been proved quite popular! I was kinda bummed to hear that they made more abaptions to this like the sequel and rebooted this in 2014. I won't be planning to look at them but still, I was annoyed that Hollywood decided to kill the original movie! So yup, I loved the action and of course be aware of the blood or gore in this!" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Detroit police officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is critically wounded in the line of duty. A corporation struggling with public image bends its resources toward remaking Officer Murphy into a superhuman, cybernetic police officer. Robocop then proceeds to wear anal orifices for socks as he struggles with his humanity. In all, this movie is outstanding from a technical point of view. Nothing really failed and most of the technical aspects of film making succeeded beautifully for the time with the only hiccups being in the acting department. This is one of the rare examples of everything coming together just right in a product that is by no means Oscar-worthy. Personally I love this movie for its writing. It flows nicely with no ponderous slow spots and it packs so much into a relatively short time, from humanist themes to 1980s culture parody to criticizing corporatism and the whole time, delivering a narrative that is far from preachy and keeps you entertained. Movies just aren't written like this anymore. Granted, the plot is a bit campy, even for the 80s, but it was done very well. I would highly recommend this movie to watch because it is a good movie on technical merit, if you keep the time it was made in mind (which to me, is the only fair way to judge film)." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "RoboCop (1987): Dir: Paul Verhoeven / Cast: Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, Kurtwood Smith, Ronny Cox, Dan O'Herlihy: Overrated yet innovative action film about advance technology. Officer Murphy is shot to death but revived as partial robot to stop crime in Detroit but past memories soon surface causing him to pursue those who took his life. Well established plot becomes routine catering to a graphic action climax. Directed by Paul Verhoeven as his first major hit. He previously made the cult film Soldier of Orange. A big technical achievement with Peter Weller portraying the overwhelming crime stopping Robocop. Weller plays off a sense of loss and a sense of curiosity as he struggles to adapt to his new life. He soon realizes real benefits when it comes to dealing with crime. Nancy Allen as his partner is basically a cardboard female lead. Kurtwood Smith plays a convincing villain who actually is responsible for nearly dismantling Robocop when he and his gang shoot him up until he is able to find cover. Ronny Cox plays the standard issue villain whose defeat is less climatic than intended. Dan O'Herlihy plays a character called \"the old man\" perhaps because they are attempting to remind him that he has gray hair. While story is somewhat standard fare, Verhoeven does present a new kind of action hero. It demonstrates the possibilities and disadvantages of technology.

"I hadn't seen this movie in a hundred years, well since the 80's anyway but I'd always remembered that it was a good movie. I caught it again on TV the other night and went in expecting an absolute 80's cheesefest; with bad special effects and satirical bad guys but I was pleasantly surprised, this is still a good movie. Yes it is a bit dated now in terms of special effects and the super cool opening graphics but not as much as I was expecting and in terms of when this was made, its pretty brilliant. Lots of clever ideas, with an intelligent story disguised somewhat by action, gore and dark satire. Peter Weller does a fantastic job as Officer Alex Murphy, a Detroit police officer who is killed in the line of duty and then resurrected as a half human-half robot programed to serve justice at any cost -a quest that is often at odds with his thirst for revenge against the thugs that killed him. Weller manages to express a lot of emotion from under his mask and must have really worked on getting the robotic body language down, the jerkiness. I wound up feeling really sorry for his character. Lots of familiar faces amongst the business men and bad guys with Clarence Boddicker standing out as the perfect baddie, trying to kill 'Murphy (again). He spouts my favourite line from the movie upon entering Miguel Ferrer's cocaine party \"bitches leave\". There are also some funny ads (the Nuke-Em game) and ironic futuristic news clips. A movie worth checking out again, its stood the test of time. 6/23/15" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "The original Robocop is a film that I've seen several times now and no matter how many times I watch it it's a film that never loses its appeal with me. Anyone who is familiar with Verhoeven's work will know that he has a love for two things; satire and blood shed and with Robocop we get plenty of both. Robocop is also rife with swipes at capitalism and corporate greed (you can well imagine large corporations wasting huge amounts of money on a failed project and continually refusing to believe that said failed project is a waste of time). This kind of acts as a running theme in the background. I think what really sets Robocop apart from many science fiction/action films is that it has a heart and is also intelligent. In the wrong hands this could have been just a mindless shoot em up (which would have been fine, but it wouldn't have made it particularly memorable). It's also a film that has a lot of heart; Murphy is a likable family man, a nice guy and therefore I found the scenes when he's starting to reform his memories to be particularly moving. These flashbacks and memories help to flesh out Murphy's character and ultimately give us enough of a vested interest to care about his character and the story in general. Are there any problems with this film? Yes only a couple of minor ones though; the ED209 robot effects are clunky and fairly laughable now, but we have to remember that this was made back in 1987 and SFX move on very quickly. I also found it hard to understand why Dick Jones would put a directive 4 in place to stop Robocop arresting him, but didn't put one in to stop Robocop arresting Boddicker or any of his cronies? I mean that is effectively what brought Jones' entire operation down? Having said that these are minor niggles more than anything and despite these minor problems Robocop is still an excellent film. It's violent, it's bloody, but it's also intelligent and strangely for a sci-fi/action film it actually has a bit of heart as well. A wonderful film that has clearly stood the test of time and one that still holds up well following repeat viewings." "Poetic, Nasty, Smooth, Ultra-Sleek, Witty, Bloody, Violent, Rich, Cutting-Edge Action Satire that was a Huge Hit with Both Critics and Audiences. Rarely Such Diversified Elements Come Together So Well as in This Reagan-Era, Corporate, Fascist, In-Your-Face Take on So Many of the Era's Iconic and Social Concerns. Nothing Falls Short in this Over the Top Sci-Fi Crime Movie. Things Mesh, Like Peter Weller's Sympathetic Portrayal of Murphy/RoboCop and the Villainous Gang Headed by Kurtwood Smith as Bodicker, An Evil Leader of the Thugs and Partner to Big-Corp. This Sadistic, Heinous Bad-Guy is Just One More Spot-On Element in this Sleeper/Winner that Remains as Entertaining and Pertinent Today as the Year it was Released. That's the Definition of a Classic. The SFX of ED-209 Done in Stop-Motion May Look a Bit Clunky Compared with the Slick CGI of Today, but it is Well Done and Adds a Surreal Tone to the Scenes and the Bipedal Robot Can Still Captivate the Screen. On the Human Side, Miguel Ferrer, Nancy Allan (in Her best performance), and the Supporting Cast are All Outstanding from Top to Bottom (on both sides of the Law). Overall, Social Satire Sci-Fi Doesn't Get Any Better than this. Director Verhoeven's Starship Troopers (1997) Comes Close, but This One, Set in a Crumbling American City that Today is a Crumbling American City, is More Up Close and Personal and the Focus is Sharp and Cartoons its Way Into the Annals of Great Pop Culture." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This sci-fi movie still holds up well today. It goes straight to the action. I am amazed that Peter Weller's Robocop can express so much emotion under the mask. In fact, even his walk and movements are very expressive. Miguel Ferrer's role as the ambitious businessman was great. You could feel his desperation. Clarence Boddicker's villainous role is pitch perfect. He plays a crime boss who enjoys wreaking havoc and who killed Peter Weller's character. It is also good that Robocop also highlights some interesting predictions such as an invasion to other countries, and the rise of corporations. In short, this movie succeeds because it is able to balance drama with action without getting too mushy. On the other hand, it knows what it is: an action movie with great shooting." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "In a dystopic and crime-ridden Detroit, a terminally wounded cop returns to the force as a powerful cyborg haunted by submerged memories. Detroit - in the future - is crime-ridden, and run by a massive company. The company have developed a huge crime-fighting robot, which unfortunately develops a rather dangerous glitch. The company sees a way to get back in favor with the public when a cop called Alex Murphy is killed by a street gang. Murphy's body is reconstructed within a steel shell and named RoboCop. The RoboCop is very successful against criminals, and becomes a target of supervillain Boddicker. Roger Ebert wrote \"Most thriller and special-effects movies come right off the assembly line. You can call out every development in advance, and usually be right. \"RoboCop\" is a thriller with a difference.\" RoboCop is not just your run of the mill sci-fi/thriller film or whatever, it is quite a poignant and moving film too." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Professor Weller is spectacular in his portrayal of Murphy. The supporting cast members are all on the same story-page and perform to a 'T'. The movie is directed flawlessly, Paul Verhoeven did a very commendable job with this venture. There is a perfect-paced tempo married with enough suspense laced humor that chuckling and cringing are common place. This thing is enjoyable from beginning to end. For this movie, I had a lot of funthe only flaw I noticed was what happened after this production. Why did they whip up a \"Robocop\" franchise? Why did some knucklehead insist on making sequels? Come on, with sequels gradually sucking worse than their predecessors, the writing should have been on the wall  and I only wish they took the hint and had left well enough alone. Anyways  the movie is awesome and I highly recommend it" "I had not seen it for year, s I don't remember it being as gory back then but I was really surprise as the gory it was, I did not expect that at all. That is one of reason why I really enjoyed the movie, thought it was really well made, a lot of action in the movie that blends in with the drama. There few one-liners to make you laugh, here and there and I think the effects for time was really good. the acting was great from the cast 7 out of 10" "\"Your move, creep.\" Robocop is one of those movies I watched as a kid when I probably shouldn't have, but i'm glad I did. It's consistently as dramatic as it is funny and satirical, making it a really unique film. It has a lot to say about corporations and the government, and what it has to say is relevant even today. Plus it's amazingly 80's feeling, and you gotta love that. The plot of this film comes across as very cheesy. A cop who is killed in action is brought back as a robotic cop. And it is very cheesy. But somehow, the film makes you care about what happens. Perhaps it has to do with Peter Weller's great performance. I feel like it's a pretty underrated performance, because people don't realize how much thought went into the way Robocop moves around. Weller just does it so well. There's also a good amount of practical effects here, such as the blood and gore, and even some stop motion stuff. It's always great to see practical effects rather then the mass amounts of CGI that we see today. Overall, Robocop is a great movie. It's essentially a really well made B-movie, but that's kinda what makes it great. It's highly quotable and lots of fun. Watch it." "The eighties birthed dozens of iconic characters and one of the coolest, in my opinion, has always been RoboCop. Half-man, half-machine. The coolest cop in Old Detroit. More than 20 years later, he's still one of the most awesome action heroes to come out of the era, and the film still holds up today. I lament the fact that there is a new generation whose first exposure to the character might be the toothless 2014 reboot. The original is a far superior film with wit, brutality, and a myriad of memorable moments that stick with you long after the movie's over. From director Paul Verhoeven, ROBOCOP is the story of Alex Murphy (Peter Weller). Murphy is a recent transfer and his first time out in his new precinct ends with local kingpin Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith) and his cronies filling him with more shotgun slugs than one would think humanly possible. Meanwhile, the conglomerate OCP is in need of a \"volunteer\" for their new RoboCop program when their unmanned police robot, the ED-209, displays some hazardous glitches. Murphy is rebuilt as the now legendary RoboCop and immediately begins cleaning the streets of Old Detroit. As the population goes wild for their new law enforcement hero, sinister forces conspire to terminate his program. Boddicker learns that Murphy survived their encounter and wants to tie up his loose ends, and OCP senior president Dick Jones (Ronny Cox) resents that RoboCop overshadowed his own ED-209 program and worries that RoboCop might pose a threat to his underworld ties. Where to begin? I love this movie. The premise, when viewed subjectively, is pretty cheesy: a half-man, half-machine superhuman police officer. But it's just handled so perfectly. It never takes itself too seriously, coming at the audience with a wink and a smile that helps soften the blow of the gratuitous violence. It opens with a news clip where overly-enthusiastic broadcasters deliver news of violence in South Africa with the same dopey smile that they'd deliver celebrity gossip, and the citizens are obsessed with a cheesy, breast-filled sitcom that gave us one of the most quotable lines in the movie (\"I'd buy that for a dollar!\"). Meanwhile, Old Detroit's in shambles with gang violence running rampant. Really, the movie was pretty accurate in it's predictions on what the future of America might look like. We may not be at the dystopian level of the movie yet, but we're close with our TV- obsessed culture and the privatization of the police force a possible reality in the not-too-distant future. ROBOCOP takes what could've been a lazy B-grade action schlock film and turns it into a social commentary. Who would've thought it with a name like ROBOCOP? The movie's got an undercurrent of humor running throughout and has its share of laughs from the sheer absurdity at times. As refreshing as the satire and humor are, it never overshadows the action and ROBOCOP is a shining example of how much Verhoeven loves some brutal violence in his movies. Just as was the case with Brett's death scene in ALIEN, one ROBOCOP scene in particular had haunted me since childhood and was the sole reason it took me a while to revisit the film. I was pretty young at the time and I can't even remember how I came to watch it. I remember the initial boardroom scene with the ED-209 blew my mind but it was until the end of the movie where it got to be a little much when Boddicker's henchman Emil (Paul McCrane) saw his end. That scene cemented itself in my young mind because of just how much it freaked me out. I won't spoil it here for anyone who hasn't seen the movie, but it's probably one of the coolest parts. Despite the horror of the scene sending me running at the time, the image of RoboCop, the character, stuck with me and he was always one of my favorite characters, even though I hadn't the nerve to even finish the movie. Having gone back and revisited the movie in later years, it's no surprise why. RoboCop is just awesome. I love the character design (that new stealth black model of the 2014 is garbage in comparisonlike some sort of an anthropomorphic iPhone) and his stone-cold robotic stoicism. He was like some sort of futuristic Western hero, stomping into town, twirling his gun, and confronting the baddies. As I grew older, I came to realize just how awesome all the performances in the film were (not just the Robo-variety). Kurtwood Smith, who for the longest time I'd only known as the dad from \"That 70's Show\", is a perfect villain! I guess it shouldn't have surprised me but he's bizarrely charismatic for a psychopath. Nancy Allen, Ronny Cox, Miguel Ferrer they're all rock solid in the film. The ROBOCOP franchise might not've seen as much success as I'd want after the mind-blowingly awesome original, but the first film is still a classic piece of action. I was hoping the reboot might pick up where the original left off and build on it but, instead, it's made it apparent that a movie like Verhoeven's ROBOCOP probably wouldn't get made in modern times and I doubt we'll ever see anything that'll stand up to its strength. It has aged amazingly well and it's just as good as it was more than 20 years ago and, if you've gone this long without watching the original 1987 ROBOCOP, you owe it to yourself to give it a shot." "\"Robocop\" is underrated , misunderstood and ingenious classic action science fiction movie. It's full of excess , black humor and satire. There's more here than meets the eye. On the surface it's just a B-class movie , but it exceeds expectations as one of the smartest science fiction movies ever made. The writers were inspired by many sources  \"Wizard of Oz\" , \"Frankenstein\" ,\"Blade runner\" , \"Terminator\" , comic books (Iron man and Judge Dredd) sci-fi stories of William Gibson and even a little bit of western is here. Robocop's three Prime Directives are reminiscent of the Three Laws of Robotics as devised by sci-fi author Isaac Asimov . We have here Brixby Snyder, a parody of Benny Hill whose running line is \"I'd buy that for a dollar\" . There is some subtle Christ imagery here. Verhoeven has stated that he sees the character as a futuristic version of Christ. \"Robocop\" is highly entertaining action movie with heroes for whom you can root and villains who are deliciously evil. Paul Verhoeven's direction is superb. The ultra-violence is so over-the-top that it's not really shocking to look at but almost more comical like because it's just so cartoonish. The action scenes are well staged , fast paced and the mix of live action with stop motion effects works wonderfully. His biggest accomplishment is however the fact that the movie really tugs at viewer's heartstrings. Verhoeven really makes you care about his hero and the movie is full of haunting sadness . The movie has a lot of heart and feels almost like an Greek tragedy. It's not that far from \"Blade runner\" in asking question what it means to be human. The well written screenplay presents a cynical view of future. Money driven society , over-commercialized future , corporate greed , dehumanization of almost everyone  it's all here. The vision of future in \"Robocop\" is really scary , because if you look at the world today you will notice how accurate the movie satire is. Political prostitution , big companies which control almost every part of our existence , criminals everywhere from street thugs to business execs , society dominated by technology  it's all already happening now. \"Robocop\" is a brilliant portrayal of 80's America that is even more relevant today. Wicked , witty , razor sharp script provides a MANY BIG LAUGHS and at the same time is thought provoking. Themes that appear in this movie are : man vs. self , man vs. man , man vs. technology , man vs. society , man vs. fate , identity, humanity , transition , capitalism , technology , privatization. There is uplifting message here that sounds honest  human element will ALWAYS rise in some kind of form. Some brilliant and memorable ideas include series of first-person perspectives , several fake advertisements (The Family Heart Center, Nukem,6000 SUX ) and the climactic \"Melting Man\" scene. There are some awe inspiring design's  Robocop's suit , Robocop's handgun , ED 209. And who could forget such great one liners like \"Dead or alive , your coming with me\" or \"Your move creep\". Acting is a very strong point of this movie. Peter Weller does wonders in the role of Robo. His cold voice , mechanical movements and the whole spectrum of emotions he is able to show only with his jaw.. A truly great performance. Kurtwood Smith shines as the Clarence Bodicker  heartless ,sadistic , Himmler like criminal. The supporting cast is also more than solid  Nancy Allen (Lewis) , Ronny Cox (Dick Jones) , Miguel Ferrer (Bob Morton) and others. Memorable and likable characters that are well played  what more do you need ? Interesting thing  Arnold Schwarzenegger and Rutger Hauer were considered for the role of Robocop. The technical aspects stood the test of time. Movie was rightfully Oscar nominated for best editing and best sound . The half-orchestra , half-synthesizer score by Basil Poleudoris is both heroic and tragic. \"Robocop theme\" is just outstanding. Jost Vocano provides the movie with some great photography. The effects vary from the magnificent to the slightly shoddy , but considering the low budget (only 13 million ) I'm amazed how REALLY well this movie looks. Brilliant , smart and highly entertaining classic from the 80's. I give it 9/10."

"Just watched this again for the first time since the 90's. Simple comic book storyline about a dead cop reclaimed by a big Corporation and converted into a crime fighting cyborg. Extremely violent in places with gory details, the robot effects are entertaining as are the moments of satire throughout the film. There isn't too much more to say about it, Robocop is about cheap thrills for those who enjoy violent movies laced with satire. From what I remember Robocop 2 was decent as well and there is a new Robocop movie but according to Mark Kermode the original is still the best." "A fun concept: In a dystopic and crime-ridden Detroit, a terminally wounded cop returns to the force as a powerful cyborg haunted by submerged memories. It's definitely not the thing to see if you're in the mood for something fun and uplifting, or something with tons of thrills and action. The metaphors in this movie are so abundant. The director likes to show certain things: scenes that might not be a part of the story, but add much to the story in general, the way a writer might prelude a chapter by describing something connected to, but not in line with the characters. Unfairly dismissed by some as confusing. 7/10." "There's quite a bit of fairly funny satire in ROBOCOP, which is one of the things that makes it well worth watching- at least once. The biggest irony, I suppose, is that a lot of what was satirical back in 1987 is nowadays taken for granted as \"just the way things are.\" We've come along way, I guess... Peter Weller gives a solid performance as Murphy and this is arguably Verhoeven's finest film to date, but it was the fx that made this one a must-see when it first hit town. The makeup fx are over-the-top funny (my favorite is the villain who gets soaked with toxic waste and begins melting) and the ED209 was so cool that I kept an action figure of it for years. That's not to downplay the players: everybody in this one is playing it to the hilt, especially Ronnie Cox and Miguel Ferrar; you can hardly wait to see them get THEIRS... It's interesting to go back and look at movies like ROBOCOP decades later and find that some of them still hold up. (I've always wondered if the makers of ROBOCOP were familiar with Jack Kirby's MACHINE MAN: he and Murphy have a great deal in common.)" "This is an action-packed supercop film set in the future in Detroit, a city plagued by crime and whose police department has been bought off by Omni Consumer Products (OCP). After Officer Alex Murphy is killed by a street gang, the company retrieves his body and reconstructs him into a cyborg named RoboCop, who becomes the criminals' greatest adversary. Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner wrote a clever and captivating story for this film and I thought Paul Verhoeven did a good job in the direction, keeping the movie exciting and fast-paced and assembling a dynamic cast of characters. Peter Weller did a great job portraying RoboCop, acting like a superhero as he fights off criminals and inserting drama and emotion into the character that makes the cyborg element more intriguing, especially in the part where RoboCop's human memories of his family and of his demise slowly return to him. His personality and one-liners remind me of Arnold Scharzenegger's Terminator role at times. Nancy Allen gave a warm portrayal of RoboCop's partner-in-crime, Anne Lewis, giving it her all in what is probably her most recognizable roles. Rounding off the cast of characters are the group of ruthless and nasty villains headed by Clarence J. Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith) you would love to root against and headed by Dick Jones, played by Ronny Cox from the Beverley Hills Cop movies. The special effects were pretty good for the most part, although some of the robot scenes were a little too shaky and unrealistic. Some of the acting was also a bit off, reminding you of very 80s cliché dialog. But overall, it's one of the better sci-fi action movies of the 1980s and is throughly entertaining. Grade B" "Probably regarded as Paul Verhoeven's first big directorial debut, Robocop is one of the iconic 1980s film characters, up there with Batman and the Terminator. Even today, the 1987 film still stands up to any scrutiny. Alex Murphy (played by Peter Weller, a man with killer cheekbones) husband and father, is a cop relocated to Detroit's struggling police department in a time of high crime and corporate greed. Clarence Boddicker, a crime boss who works with impunity, and a company CEO look to place military grade robots in cities to replace the degraded police force and take control. However when on assignment, Murphy is maliciously gunned down and killed by Boddicker's men, only for a rival corporation to revive him as an autonomous servant of justice. But is there anything left of Murphy's humanity left? It is easy to forget, twenty-seven years down the line, how bloody and violent Robocop really is, and it doesn't hold back. Murphy's horrific murder occurs in the film's first act and mentally scarred a generation for good reason! But I don't want you to get the wrong impression, I love the film's dedication to using ridiculous amounts of blood squibs and physical stunts. This is what the late 80s were best at, the action in this film is simple but wonderfully executed. The Robocop himself is cumbersome, he walks and moves with deliberately jerky motions, but when the action starts, he is an unstoppable force. I could get side-tracked and go on about the action, ED-209 and all, but what's nice about the film is its more subtle story telling with its characters. Very little is told about Murphy before his death, just enough to get us to understand quite how much has been lost. It is a story of the corporate desire to replace human beings with computers, only here it is literal. Murphy is dead, his body is completely mechanised, his family left, there's nothing for him to hold on to yet his humanity lingers and tries to recover within the bonds of corporate designs. Possibly Paul Verhoeven's best work, it is a simple concept now but it still strikes a cord even in today's world. It has the director's signature satire and humour throughout, and not-so-subtle messages of greed and corporate take overs (got to love those TV adverts, one for a board game called \"Nukem\", were you dictate nuclear war on other nations) If you haven't seen Robocop, what are you doing with your life? Sure some of the composite special effects with the monstrous ED-209 have dated, but it is a solid action movie (and let's not forget in this day and age, an original movie) and it demands your attention." "What can one say about Robocop, the 1987 Verhoeven classic, that hasn't already been said before? A true delight of both visual filmmaking and action driven storytelling. At it's most basic one would describe Robocop as a slick action thriller but under the surface lurks a deeply thought provoking take on Mary Shelly's Victorian classic, Frankenstein and what it is that makes us human? What it is that defines our humanity? No one could ever accuse the story of Robocop of being new, the themes it explores are themes that have been explored and regurgitated in every art form throughout our history, every generation has asked these same questions. The true beauty of Robocop is not in it's originality but in the way Verhoeven makes us look at a familiar tale through new eyes, we the viewer are invited to look at humanity through Robocop's eyes, to see what he sees, to get a glimpse of what it is he thinks and to see what it is specifically that drives his character on in eventually discovering his own humanity. Verhoeven and Neumeier make no allusion to the fact that Robocop is inspired by comic book characters like Judge Dredd and Rom the Space Knight, but unlike the aforementioned Judge Dredd, who's own film in 1995 can only be described as an abortion of filmmaking, Verhoeven and Neumeier are able to successfully and faithfully portray the core concepts of these titular characters on the big screen, whilst retaining a genuine uniqueness and provoking perspective. Even when taking off one's rose tinted glasses, deep fried in greasy cinematic nostalgia, it is obvious that Robocop is a masterpiece of filmmaking that holds up even to this day. Yes some of the effects have aged, most notably the stop-motion animation that brings the ED-209 to life, and some of the dialogue is definitely stuck in the 80's, yet neither of these things can detract from what is otherwise a stellar film. Some have criticized the film for it's over the top action and gore but I find rather than taking your attention away from the central themes of the narrative, the action and gore instead add to it. No action scene in the film is pointless and dragged into the murky waters of style over substance, instead each action scene is central to the film and helps to progress the story forward towards it's blockbuster ending. Modern action filmmakers in the mold of Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich should take note of how it should be done. Perhaps the part of this film that is the most impressive is Peter Weller's performance as the title character, his ability to convey a character who is more machine than man through his movements is at times truly spectacular, such is his ability as an actor, we the audience truly buy him as a robotic law enforcement officer, truly pragmatic in his work, yet at the same time he portrays's a man, a man with weaknesses and doubts, a man capable of love and all the other emotions on the human spectrum. This subtle conveyance of emotion, the tiny facial movements that play across Weller's face, even though we can only see a portion of him is the beauty of Robocop. But perhaps the true genius of Robocop, the holy trinity that makes this film the masterpiece it is, is the titanic culmination of Peter Weller's performance, Verhoeven's direction and Neumeier's writing. Truly these three ingredients are what makes Robocop the classic it is. To summarize Robocop is a surprisingly intelligent action/sci-fi flick that explores and satirizes American culture whilst also making the viewer question what it is to be human? If only they still made films of this caliber, we would truly be living in a true golden age of cinema." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "A brutally injured cop is given the chance to go on in law and enforcement by becoming half man, half machine. After he becomes Robocop he goes after the people who cost him his human life and caused him to be this machine. This film starred: Peter Weller, Nancy Allen & Dan O'Herlihy. Robocop is an enjoyable film, It is funny at some points because of the cringy 80's action films have these cringy scenes all of the time. I do recommend this film because it is a good action film with some funny scenes attached. It is also a good revenge film. ***/***** Good film." "In a dystopian Detroit not too far off from the real thing (1987 or today), the police force is run by a corporation called Omni Consumer Products (OCP). Police officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is savagely attacked by a gang of criminals and left for dead but is revived by OCP and turned into a cyborg super cop. Stylish, satirical, ultra-violent sci-fi action movie with ample doses of black humor. Paul Verhoeven's best film. The kind of movie that is easily dismissed but deserves more praise than it gets. Great action and effects but also solid performances from the cast and a very good script. Basil Pouledoris' score is one of the best of any '80s movie. A classic that gets better with repeated viewings." "Underrated is the truth. The subtle emotional plays between family, the psychological development and metamorphic change of the main character from beginning to the climax, far exceed the original, the changes being brought about by different means. Relevant upgrades using modern technology and well played and the use of set and design make the film an eye candy delight. The flow of the film, the composition to final cut is much smoother than the original. It is a far deeper RoboCop here, a multi layered play that moves effortlessly to the end. If the other movie hadn't existed and this was viewed as a stand alone film, with it's own merits, it would be a good film. The comparisons to the original film should be put aside, it is not a scene by scene remake like Psycho, Nikita, The Vanishing or other films ruined by a dull or sanitized ending. It is a great as a sci-fi future film in the tones of the Terminator, fresh and updated.... for now." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "As the technical prowess and political power of corporations have grown, so have the people's fear and suspicion of corporate governance. Robocop brings these issues to the fore. In an unknown time of anarchic crime, a large corporation intends to privatize the police force by installing bionic police officers throughout the city. Robocop, a resurrected police officer, is the first of this kind. He is a machine and yet retains some of his humanity. As the movie progresses, he gradually rediscovers this humanity until he overthrows his corporate makers, who, of course, are not interested in people's safety as much as profits. The movie is hopeful: Corporations can never eradicate human morality and free will. What makes Robocop great is its streamlined and to-the-point editing. The movie wastes nary a second. Every scene briefly illustrates a plot point or an action scene, and then moves on. The movie even ends at its climax, having no time for post-climatic sentiment and catharsis. Despite being thirty years old, the movie still feels fresh and futuristic, perhaps because it doesn't rely on special effects so much as hard metal and fiery explosions. Robocop is a classic. It brings up interesting issues that TV shows are still exploring (e.g., Continuum), all while being very entertaining."

"*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Well I wanted to see this movie for a couple of reasons - one being that I liked the idea of it and the other being that I enjoy the work of Paul Veerhoven as a director (for the most part). Many people seem to build this up as a sci-fi/action classic and I agree. Okay so the story - a rookie cop named Alex Murphy is in a Dystopian Detroit where crime is everywhere. On his first assignment he is blown apart by a Crime gang. Meanwhile a company named OCP is working on ways to make the city safer. One way is with a complete robot that malfunctions in the sense that even if the criminal complies he gets more holes in him than Swiss cheese while another project is to take the corpse of an existing cop and replace most of his body with mechanical parts. After Murphy awakes as RoboCop and he becomes a big success. The person who designed him gets assassinated by the guy who built the malfunctioning robot, named Richard Jones on the grounds of \"You went over my head! I wanted to do something like this!\". Then RoboCop finds out that he was once human and that the people who killed him still roam free and he tries to arrest or kill everyone responsible. Once that finally happens he realizes the Crime Boss works for Jones. Okay I just have to mention this before I talk about anything else. Why is it in Action movies the henchmen can't hit the hero if he was 2 feet in front of him. Now, they seem to hit RoboCop with a pistol okay but there is a scenario in this movie where four guys armed with high tech bazooka's couldn't hit A SEVEN FOOT TALL SLOW MOVING HALF ROBOT! I think that's a pretty easy target to spot and easier to shoot it. To be fair though that scene is hilarious. Now onto the stuff I liked. The emotion of the story. It might be a little bit cliff note but most of the science fiction movies of today rarely put in any emotion (there have been a few small exceptions like Serenity and Neill Blomkamp's work but that's all off the top of my head). It might be small but I liked it very much. And of course there's just so many times this movie goes over-the-top. Every death scene of a major villain is usually done in the most over the top way they can think of among other things like the commercials. The entertainment value in something like that for me just makes me like the movie a bit more for the charm of doing this. RoboCop is just simply 80's cheese. The special effects for it's time are actually pretty damn impressive, to an extent they still are to this day. The Sets are really good and there's just so much enjoyment to be had from just watching some over-the-top gory action but with surprisingly a but of heart. I will watch the sequels and the remake (although to be fair it looks more like a \"I'm just going to wait until DVD for this one\"). If you like Science fiction with an action edge then this is for you." "A true master piece of the action genre. Robocop's struggle between being man or machine really is interesting. The graphic nature of this movie feels like the 80's action movie it is. True those that are skeptical of blood probably won't enjoy some of the scenes, overall the story of a company putting man inside a machine for justice is worth seeing a few people shot. I also love Peter Welling's portraying of his character. From the loving husband to the robot to having to find himself, you can't help but root for him through the entire movie. He is like a superhero in a sense and watching the whole movie is sure to give you goosebumps. This is one movie no action movie fan should miss." "Now that the remake is inevitable this movie is simply one of the best sci-fi action of all time. When this movie came out in 1987 was extremely violent (now 26 years later still is very violent) the special effects was Awesome,the action amazing,the acting more than good and the music unforgettable. The movie was directed by Paul Verhoven and this movie was the star for another great sci fi movies he later make (Total Recall,Starship Troopers)so the movie was in the right hands since the beginning. The movie worth it to see again i personally recommended to see it in blu ray...Go besides Robocop and make justice!!!." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This is a very good movie and I am becoming to think that Verhoeven is a very intelligent director. The movie is a action movie but there are a few things that stand out and that is the character of Robocop - rather than simply being an emotionless killing machine, like the Terminator, it is a being struggling with its humanity and duty to serve. It also shows intelligence as it looks not only at its prime directives, but at a forth hidden directive. The story is based around a lot of things. It is set in the future where the signs of industrialisation are showing on the world and America is quickly disintegrating (gee, might even be now). What one must remember is that this is the first of a trilogy and more is unfolded in further movies. The giant in this world is Omni Consumer Products (OCP) and they are based in Detroit and have plans to create a new city. Unfortunately crime is running rampant in the city, led by the crime lord Clarance Bardiager, and the cops are fighting a loosing battle. OCP attempts to implement a new droid, ED-209, but is does not work, killing an executive in a board meeting. Vice President Dick Jones is pushing for the ED-209 unit, but a younger executive has an idea, Robo-cop. Alex Murphy, a recent transfer, is then seriously injured in a nasty altercation with Clarence Bardeger and his gang, and is rushed to hospital where he dies on the hospital table. His body is appropriated by OCP and he is turned into Robocop, the ultimate law enforcer. They believe that he is just a machine controlled by a human brain, but we slowly notice that he still has his personality and his memories. The first example of this is that when he is asked to list his directives, he gives the main three, and then searches and discovers a forth hidden one. This movie is a character study of Robocop set in the background I have described. It is a background of corporate struggles, escalating crime, and blackmail. As Robocop is becoming embroiled in the corporate struggles and lies, he is trying to rediscover his identity and convince himself that he is alive. We learn more about the Robocop units in the next movie, but in this one we simply see a man dedicated to enforcing the law. One person recognises him, and that is his former partner. Even though she only worked with Murphy for one day, she instantly recognised one of his mannerisms and realised that this Robocop was made from the remains of Murphy. As the movie progresses, Robocop slowly comes explore his memories and seeks to bring himself back to life. Everywhere he looks he sees the remnants of a dead Murphy: all except for his former partner, who recognises that Murphy has been resurrected in the form of a very strong Robocop (we know that he is not indestructible). The epiphany is when he gets his partner to adjust his targeting and his shoots the canisters of babyfood that he was being fed. He is not a baby, he is Alex Murphy. And for the rest of the movie he has his helmet removed. Also in this movie, the Old Man, the managing director of OCP, seems to be the good guy. The bad guy is VP Dick Johnson, who is consorting with criminals and manipulating things to give him more money and power. He wants the ED-209 to succeed because he knows that a faulty robot brings much more money to OCP than does a perfect Robocop. Unfortunately for Dick, Murphy blows away an ED-209 within two seconds (though his first encounter is not to crash hot, but then he was caught by surprise). I just love this movie, as one can see that I have been raving on about it for such a long time. There is a lot in this movie, but on top of that it is also very entertaining. I simply love Robocop." "RoboCop is considered one of the best action sci-fi films of the 1980s, a dark, satirical film from the Dutch master of sci-fi action Paul Verhoeven. In the future Detroit is a crime infested city with gangs running wild and the police struggling to cope, made even worst when a private company, Omni Consumer Products (OCP) buy the Detroit police force. OCP are looking for ways to make the police more effective by using robotic police enforcers and a middle level executive, Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer) proposes the RoboCop project. On the front line Alex Murphy (Paul Weller) is a police officer transferred to central Detroit, the most dangerous precinct in the area. When he gets fatally and brutally shot on his first day of duty he becomes a prime candidate to become RoboCop, the ultimate law enforcer. But as RoboCop Alex starts to regain his memories and sets out to find his wife and son and find the men who destroyed his life. RoboCop is a gloriously violent film that Verhoeven is expert at providing this over the top style with limbs getting blown off and massive bullet holes blown into people. There are solid action sequences throughout, particularly the shoot outs and car chases. Verhoeven knows how to make it the action compelling, even though on the surface RoboCop seems invincible and character seeming physically slow. For the time RoboCop had excellent special effects, using physical effects like the costume and the charm of seeing stop motion effects. One of the key elements to why people love RoboCop is the comedy, dark humour and satire. This is mainly shown at the looks of the corporate world with a multi-national company particularly privatising all public services, including services that should not be run for profit. There are digs at the corporate culture of the 80s of backstabbing, drug taking and basically only caring about profit when older businessmen do at least care about their products and consumers. This is certainly a criticism of Reganism and Thatcherism and the idea of business being a left to their own devices. There are also broader satires in the form of adverts and news reports, tackling American militarism, consumerism and attacked the idea of a Star Wars laser system. There are even modern comparisons (as of 2013) you can put to the film because many American cities, including Detroit, have declared bankruptcy or on the edge of bankruptcy. There are many cities in Mid- West of America suffering from industrial and urban decline, population decline, underfunded public services and social issues like poverty and crime, leading to a vicious circle. RoboCop can act as a commentary on these themes. One of the other key parts to the film is RoboCop finding his humanity and discovering his past, giving the film more heart and making you care more for Murphy as his life is robbed from him and more then just a bad ass crime fighter. Weller actually had a different role of someone regain his emotions and life, made tougher due to the character having a helmet covering most of his face. Weller puts it off and he had an excellent supporting cast, from Nancy Allen as a tough as nails cop who realises who RoboCop really is, Ronny Cox and Kurtwood Smith as the villains and Ferrer as a typical young highflyer in 80s culture. RoboCop is a product and commentary of its time but it is still an entertaining action film with substance, something Verhoeven does really well and it is a shame that R-rated sci-fi and action film are made as much as they use to." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong. That's Murphy's Law indeed. That's what happen to Alex Murphy (Peter Weller). Directed by Paul Verhoeven, written by Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner and set in a crime-ridden Detroit, Michigan in the near future, police officer Alex Murphy is brutally murdered by a gang of cop-killers lead by Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith). Yes, Red from that's 70's Show. Man, is he gets brutal in this movie. The movie's death scene of Murphy was the most important scene in the whole film by the director Verhoeven not because it was mere blood and guts but because it was an extremely disturbing scene where a person is tortured to death and dies in agony. It was the fullest expression of the violence of American society as viewed by Verhoeven. The movie is filled with very critical outlooks on a hyperbole negative stereotype of 80s American society, some seem very true to this day. The violence in this film is so over the top, it's silly in a way. Anyways, in some odd outlandish unrealistic way, he survived the attack. I don't know if I saw a man get 50 bullet holes in him. I would think he would be clearly dead, but he did somehow pull through. Like the 1974's Six-Million Dollar Man, Murphy is subsequently revived by the malevolent mega-corporation Omni Consumer Products (OCP) as a superhuman cyborg law enforcer known as RoboCop. Robocop nailed the cyborg concept with a cumbersome first generation unit meshed with a human being who slowly starts to piece together and remember his past human life. Over time the flashbacks that occurred gave him the memories to the point, that he seek vengeance on the gang that killed his former self. This movie is very stylish with its gore, and sort of 'yuppie' 80s businessmen cocaine type villain. The way, Paul Verhoeven shot the film with crazy 'comic' like angles gives the film, it's creative original. The movie drew it's success from the portrayal of this stoic, priority driven machine that was also something more. I liked Murphy wasn't explicitly human when he became Robo Cop, he was just a robot with the face of a man--but every now and then, that robot; something so incapable of humanity, would do something subtle and perfect, like smile or twirl his gun, and it created this illusion of a man trapped inside the machine. Murphy's slow, subtle regaining of his humanity, and his own innate sense of order and justice made the film. This movie also works as dark satire comedy with the over the top reporting and fake commercials that is throughout the film like the 'nukem' board game. In my opinion, the movie could had done without those things, because it makes away from the main plot of Robo Cop seeking revenge. There was a bit of controversial coming from this movie. The movie was originally given an X rating by the MPAA in 1987 due to its graphic violence, in sharp contrast to most other X-rated movies that received the rating due to strong sexual content. RoboCop was X-Rated 11 times before getting a R Rated. To appease the requirements of the ratings board, Verhoeven reduced blood and gore in the most violent scenes in the movie, including the executive shot to death by ED-209, Murphy's execution, and the final battle with Boddicker. A lot of kid toys were created when this movie came out, and the movie isn't a kid movie at all! It's ultimate violence, has nudity, gore and harsh language. While the marketing for the toys is market for children, the movie is a rare Sci-Fiction made for adult. It's make it even more rare today, where most Sci-Fiction movies today are PG-13.Robocop has lot of great themes like about the will of the human spirit overcoming greed and corruption. This is eugenics defined. Man and machine merging together creating a police state of the classes and no will towards freedom of expression. RoboCop themes cover a lot of issues, the media, gentrification, corruption, privatization, capitalism, identity, dystopia and human nature. Director Paul Verhoeven, known for his heavy use of Christian symbolism, states in the documentary \"Flesh and Steel: The Making of RoboCop\" that his intention was to portray RoboCop as a Christ figure. I just didn't see this. I really don't see RoboCop in the same light of Jesus. Unless, Jesus shot a bunch of drug- dealers during his time on Earth. The character of RoboCop itself was inspired by British comic book hero Judge Dredd. You can see the similarities clearly with the robot design suit. Taking influence from Japanese comics \"The 8 Man\" and the first Tokusatsu Metal Hero \"Uchuu Keiji Gavan (Space Sheriff Gavan)\" from Toei. Based on Peter Weller, the suit was hard to move in. You can clearly see that in the film. There are moments that I think Robo Cop might trip or fall over when he walk. It isn't that bad. By making him so stiff, it's allows us to believe that he is indeed a Robot. The stop motion is a bit dated and laggy, but it was pretty cool at the time. I did like ED-209. The sound was a bit trippy. There was apparently no sound re-editing in the film, because the scenes feel very rough in terms of audio, and you can even hear where certain sounds are looped in order to fill the newfound soundtrack gaps in the extended scenes. The score is amazing, Basil Poledouris did a good job. I'm not looking forward to RoboCop reboot in 2014. Here all I see is a man inside of a black Iron Man style suit who is swift moving and acts with too much human emotion to portray a realistic cyborg. It's so unlike this movie. In the end, RoboCop is a deep well made satire with amazing effects and top-notch emotional drama" "Extremely violent but entertaining and smart film(directed with high energy and style by Paul Verhoeven) about a viciously murdered policeman being \"resurrected\" in a scientific experiment involving placing his mind, and some body parts, into a mobile machine(called Robocop) where he will be sent out to fight crime in a brutal and corrupt Detroit in the near future. Peter Weller and Nancy Allen are very good here, playing former partners trying to adjust to the situation, all the while fighting not only vicious drug gangs, but the very company that built the Robocop technology. The supporting cast is very good, the writing sharp,(much effective satire here) and the model F/X astonishing. Only issue is that it doesn't know when enough is enough at times,(climax gets pretty wild) but otherwise a pretty good film, first of a trilogy." "Robocop is a great with a good storyline that sometimes falls flat but is overall strong and different,the cast aren't brilliant,but all the highly exaggerated action and effects won't make their performances a huge problem.Peter Weller does do a good job,but thats only once he becomes Robocop,who is suppose to be motionless.The movie had some surprising heart,very likable characters and the effects were very impressive for a movie made in 1987.It probably won't turn out very good,but I look forward to seeing the remake next year,it will be interesting to see how it could look today,which much better effects available.Robocop certainly isn't perfect and you should definitely toss your brain out the window before you watch it,but its a must see for all action fans. Alex Murphy (Peter Weller),a police officer,is murdered by a gang of criminals,but borough back to life as a cyborg,known as Robocop,who fights crime and never sleeps,now looking to track down the criminals who killed him." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "The story of a young American policeman who after being brutally murdered is then brought back to life as a robot losing everything but his face and the memories of his loved ones. Although tragic in a way, Robocop or Murphy as he preferes to be known adjusts well to his new life as a kind of metal man, he benefits greatly from his new bulletproof body especially in fire fights with baddies. It's also worth noting how much free time Robocop now has due to being relieved of the need to sleep or urinate, and credit to him he uses his time well to hunt down the very people who murdered his human self and left him the pathetic shell he's now became. But it's not all doom and gloom as Robocop flirts with and eventually woos a young lady called 'Lois' and the two go on to enjoy a whirlwind romance, Robocop thrilled at one last chance at love whilst Lois at first impressed with her new fiances firm handshake eventually loses interest at his inability to procreate. Heart broken but also still very much a robot Robocop removes his helmet and goes on a rampage leading to the death of Dick Jones a brilliant entrepreneur and all round good egg." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Despite all the setbacks in production of this film. Note that RoboCop is a film. Not a movie. The wonderful narrative of RoboCop is that despite being an armored-clad cop, Murphy is portrayed as vulnerable. That is unfortunate in movies today. Too often, many a protagonist faces off with a half-assed antagonist and barely breaks a sweat en route. What RoboCop is up against is simply politics. Awesomely portrayed as a neo-Roman Empire with unlimited and ruthless conglomerate. This is not too far-fetched as one would think with the \"Great Recession\" in vogue. The conflict is that RoboCop is built by an ambitious exec who has a rivalry with the VP of the same conglomerate. While this may seem like a permeation of Mad Men, it's manifested in the plausible future where the municipalities of Detroit are literally bankrupt. The VP brokers a deal with Boddicker the prominent crime czar who parallels dick Jones VP in the conglomerate, only difference is that Boddicker is not employed by any official entity. Boddicker is a VILLAIN. He has no delusions or justification of what he does. He does it gleefully and makes no apologies afterward. Producers take note of this antagonist. I get so tired of all these civilized Blofeld types who \"kill you with kindness\". Boddicker is a villain you enjoy hating. That provokes emotions which...well, the film has done it's job! There is violence, but for today's standards, is pretty tame. It's not the gory kind, rather the kind that shows violence without implying. Just straight to the carnage. The film is really grounded in the way it portrays the future. No flying vehicles, time travel, or teleportation here. Just a raw gritty dystopia in the context of a political thriller dabbled with a satirical throwback to the yester-years of Reagan-ism. Truly, a sci-fi entry in the annals of the genre. I'll just say this much: RoboCop is not a \"movie\", it is a film in the boneyard of ghastly crap. Audaciously calling itself \"sci-fi\". Total Rekall, Blade Runner, Aliens, and 2001 are all films. Not \"movies\"."

"*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "\"RoboCop\" is as good as it gets when it comes to action films. It achieves that particular distinction of being both smart and fun at the same time. While on the one hand it satisfies as extremely visceral entertainment, it takes such a satirical look at the world of the future - commercials, newscasts, and all - that it delivers many good and substantial chuckles. It's done in a classic comic book tradition, with heroes for whom you can root and villains who are deliciously evil. It takes place in the Detroit of the near future, when the police force is now being funded and controlled by a private, omnipotent corporation named OCP. Its vision of the future is pretty bleak, with the cops being overwhelmed by various degenerate lunatic criminals. Fortunately, an executive named Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer) has an innovative idea: take a police officer \"killed\" in the line of duty and transform them into a sleek, sophisticated cyborg. The cop who gets this honour is Murphy (Peter Weller), who isn't as \"perfect\" as his creators would like: he still retains some human memories and becomes obsessed with punishing the bad guys who put him in his current predicament. Superior urban hell production design, wonderfully rousing music by Basil Poledouris, and lots of hit-you-across-the-face bloody violence help to make this a solid diversion all the way from start to finish. It's just a hell of a lot of fun. The special effects are (for the most part) amazing; Rob Bottin, who'd wowed us with his work on \"The Howling\" and \"The Thing\", is the man behind the look of RoboCop, and Phil Tippett supervises the stunning ED-209 sequences. The excellent cast also includes Nancy Allen, Daniel O'Herlihy, Robert DoQui, Ray Wise, Felton Perry, and Paul McCrane, but making the biggest impressions are Ronny Cox and Kurtwood Smith as two of the most vile bad guys to ever be committed to celluloid. Weller does a fine job of working within his cumbersome costume and creates some very human moments amid all of the nastiness on display. Allen, in a change of pace type of role, is appealing as the partner who maintains her connection to her partner, no matter what. Ferrer is good sleazy fun as the ambitious young creep. \"RoboCop\" is overall so sharp, funny, and exciting that it holds up quite well on repeat viewings. It's no surprise that it would spawn a franchise consisting of two sequels, a live action TV series, an animated series, and an upcoming remake. 26 years later, it's still one of the best action films of the past few decades. 10 out of 10." "Robocop The key to creating an ideal cyber-cop is ensuring that when salvaging tissue from the donor not to transfer over the donut-craving gene. Fortunately, the scientists in this sci-fi movie only relocated the deceased's face and memories. After being killed by a crime syndicate kingpin (Kurtwood Smith), the bullet-riddled body of Officer Murphy (Peter Weller) becomes the basis of Omni Consumer Products - the police force's parent company - first foray into mechanized officers. Tasked with cleaning up the gang-controlled streets while his human counterparts go on strike, Robocop is diligent. But when his old partner recognizes him, the floodgates holding back his memories of being Murphy are opened. A gory parody concerning the privatization of the public sector, Robocop is a smart Frankenstein-esque story that stimulates the brains low and highbrow hemispheres. While they are still cops, thankfully, the robotic ones only sexually harass the police precinct's vending machines. (Green Light) vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca" "The story essentially begins when policeman Alex Murphy is shot to death by the movie's villains in a proverbial industrial hideout. But luckily it's a quick death. Oh wait, no... no it's not. It's not a slow death at all. In fact, it is worth noting for those who proceed unawares that Murphy is not Robocop before he get's shot. You could be forgiven for thinking that he is, because he skillfully stays on his feet while being shot multiple times with multiple shot guns. Murphy is given the Darth Vader treatment and quickly resurrected as a lean mean metal machine out to get the villains who sorta killed him. The villains are a gang of thugs who aren't so much ferocious fiends as they are fanatical fun boys. One cackles like a hyena, one is a club- goer, one is a ginger jerkoff, and one can't fly. But they all enjoy turning an all-American cop into Swiss cheese. They are lead by a bald bespectacled guy named Clarence. Clarence has one problem. Cops don't like him, so Clarence don't like cops. Cops of the robo variety don't like him much either. Then there's Ron Miller! Ron Miller doesn't like to be jerked off. When people jerk him off, they die. Who is Ron Miller? He's the hostage taker who doesn't like to be jerked off. What do you get when you watch Robocop? Corporate politics, smart sexy girls, \"I'd buy that for a dollar,\" and a murdering robot named Ed who squeals like a pig when he falls over, Dead or alive you're coming with Robocop. However, if you're a rapist or a burgler, you will not be apprehended." "I'm a person from the 80's decade, this film was part of my childhood I saw this when I was about 8 if you can believe that, it's my favorite movie from one of my favorite movie directors Paul Verhoeven but most importantly this is one of my favorite movies of all time. There is just so much to this film which is one of the reasons I love it. On the surface it seems like a typical superhero story, but underneath there are layers that elevate this film to be something even more. The production value, special effects and makeup work by my favorite makeup artist Rob Bottin are all great and they still look great today because their all practical. There was a huge budget backing this film and they used every cent wisely because a truck load of effort and heart was behind it. Music is great from one of my favorite movie composers the late great Basil Polebouris, that Robo theme is one of my favorite theme songs ever. The action is great it is well choreographed and extremely violent with the gore effects involved, one of my favorite shoot out scenes is the infamous drug warehouse battle it was awesome not just on how many baddies Robo can kill but just seeing Robo use tai chi like movements with his gun against them. The villains are great from Dick Jones played well by Ronny Cox whom is a ruthless CEO that is interested in both making money and becoming the head of OCP not caring how many lives he destroys. However the one villain that really stands out for me is Clarance Bodyger play well by Kurtwood Smith. He is a right hand man for Jones whom also wants to make the big bucks, however he's also a borderline psychopath that just loves to kill cops and innocent people for fun. I also like how he has sort of this dark charisma and sometimes seems to exhibit some sort of anger management issues. And of course the other villain is the ED-209 robot, which is a great design that has been homaged in many other works. But I find the robot both menacing but funny because despite it's capabilities and how big it is, it never works correctly. Let alone like a video game boss is easy to beat once you know it's weaknesses. We see a parallel with Clarance and his criminal organization and OCP, both are businesses and their goal is simply to make money. Like in one scene we hear what Clarance's organization was going to do with the stolen money from the armored truck which was to us it as capital investment just to make more money. Dick Jones in a scene mentions when Delta City is being built illegal gambling, drugs, and prostitution will be on the rise and that would mean more money for both Dick and Clarance. The OCP company alone is interesting, it seems like a company that does great things and could of done even more but the problem is it's their greed, selfishness, and even slightly unrealistic ambitions are what keep them from making a difference. The film deviantly acknowledged the Regan era when capitalism and technology were both on the rise. The future portrayed in this film is very much prolific to what is happening today. This film has mean spirited fun with it's use of humor/black humor and satire that hits close to home, as it tackles the issues of privatization of services, monopolization, consumerism, and our common addiction to technological progress. To me the funnest moment was in those commercials we saw like that board game \"Nuke Em\" I'm still wondering what the rules of that game are. But also the film dealt with a philosophical concepts of identity, humanity and transition. Alex Murphy/Robocop is played flawless by one of my favorite actors Peter Weller, this is my favorite role from him. He hit the right notes in both emotion and physicality. I really loved how he moved which were sort of miming and tai chi like movements, he was believable as a robot moving at a strange yet natural sort of speed where he was swift but slow at the same time. The capabilities and abilities of Robo are great from his trademark gun twirl I always love, I do that every time I play a light gun video game. Though to me the most impressive was the data probe which gives you the ability to download and upload info on the computer from your brain, almost reminiscent of the sci-fi stories of William Gibson which always had to do with technology and humans trying to integrate together. But most of all I really love the amount of emotion he was able to display making Alex/Robo and superhero you feel a heavy sense of pathos for. Alex/Robo is having an identity crisis as memories of his former life download and he is just struggling to make sense as to who he is. Is he a man that was turned into a machine and is just remembering he was once a man; or is he a machine dreaming he was once a man and desires to be one. One scene I always found heartbreaking was when Alex/Robocop visits his home only to find it empty and the memories of his past flood in, that scene always made me tear up because it really showed two things a life that Alex/Robo can never go back to and also how being a superhero is never without a price to pay. This all the more makes us want Alex/Robo to win not just to overcome the forces of evil but to reclaim or find his humanity. Robocop has all the right part that continue to make him work. Rating: 4 stars" "I fondly remember seeing RoboCop as a mid-teen (sorry Dad) and being impressed by it's loud explosions, gun battles, highway chases and overall attitude. I view it now as a dressed to impress satire of quick- fire American news and commercials, almost as if Dutch maestro Paul Verhoeven decided to serve the U.S a massive overdose of it's own excess. Seeing the film after many years, it's this satirical element that really stands out. The action is noisy and brash, the bad guys are overblown to the point of verging on comical, and the violence, particularly the scene in which Peter Weller is blasted to bits before his Robo transformation, still shocks. Technically, as you might expect for an 'R' rated science fiction film coming out in the late 80′s, the special effects are something of a mixed bag of bolts. At times the FX look worse than bad Ray Harryhausen, especially when a clunky looking ED209 wobbles into the scene, but the now iconic Robo suit really holds up. Amid the violence and noise, there's a sad story here too as Murphy's consciousness, now trapped inside the RoboCop suit, battles with his programming to ascertain his own identity. Flashbacks taunt him and like Frankenstein's monster, there is a strong sense of pity felt throughout. While sometimes the silliness prevents it from attaining the classic status of say 'The Terminator', RoboCop proves to still be a curious mix of satire, overblown 80′s action and good old fashioned sci- fi." "The 80's was the epidemic of landmark movies. It was no doubt an era of heavy artillery supplied by Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger. To name a few; Predator 87\", First Blood 82\", Aliens 86\", The Terminator 84\" and more would all go forward to rule the 1980's. Released in 1987, Robocop would have to bring something explosive to the table. This futuristic sci-fi takes place in Detroit were crime rate is at its highest. The streets are crawling with Junkies, prostitutes while a global tech business, OCP (Omni Consumer products), over looks the city and controls the reign of law. It does not get more gritty than the portrayal we see at first hand. OCP is known for its advanced technology and continuity in daily developments created and mastered to protecting the public from the scum. With not much belief in your average police department, it is when the giant company buys out the police task force in hopes to creating something stronger and less vulnerable as murderers and rapists pile the dark streets of Detroit. It is when rogue cop Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is blasted to death during a tense infiltration into one of Detroit's cold blooded gangs, (a gruesome scene that joined movie history) that sees Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer) of OCP perform a body transformation. With adjustments to save the general organs of Murphy's remains, the staff at OCP construct a steel shell around the dead body of Murphy resulting in a \"\"Robocop\",a programmed walking talking killing machine assigned to protect the innocent with the ability to sustain and arrest. While Murphy's soul is nothing short of deceased, it is when former partner and witness to the crime Lewis (Nancy Allen) discovers the man behind the metal plates resulting in Robocop's reflection of memories, which is something OCP didn't want. The action packed plot sees Bob's Robocop create a kill list behind the death of his former self. The main target is indeed, in my opinion one of the biggest dirt bags to ever hit our screens, Clarence (Kurtwood Smith). If Satan had an apprentice, it was this guy. It delights me to witness the path of revenge that Robocop follows, leading to an all out war as Clarence and his men try ridding the streets of the only thing standing in their way. Although OCP staff and second man on the managers board Dick (Ronny Cox) represents true justice, Dick has eyes on a different future for the advanced company, a future without Robocop, which leads Robocop on an investigation that connects dots between the criminals of Detroit and the rich that overlook it. Ah yes, the nostalgic reflection of this movie still excites me. One year before my birth, Robocop was swarming cinemas global, estimating a total of 13,000,000 in budget. Just like a plethora of 80's action, Robocop was, and still is one of the best of that era. Its concept was highly original then, and unfortunately could not have competed with The Terminator and T2, it did succeed in terms of Sci-fi action and joined a host of movies that showed the possible gruesomeness of real-life shootings. Scene of Death: Upon the origin of Robocop, Murphy had to make a sacrifice. Not knowing he would become a protective cyborg of Detroit, he foolishly rushed in, disturbing a group of animals, resulting in a terrifying scene. Do you remember? He had his leg, arm, and eventual head blasted with shotguns, machine guns the lot. Clarence and his affiliates were a new breed of murders and rapists, which lead to a whole new direction in my movie history. The gore was frightening and the screams of laughter toward a dead cop is more haunting. The acting is far from convincing. The overall cast consisted of some well known faces of that era, if not genre of movies. In my opinion, it was just as well Peter Weller had to play out the movie in a metal suit and robotic concept as I don't think I could have stuck his cheesy acting through-out the 150minutes or so. Although he is the hero an lead star, he is the worst actor associated with this classic... sorry. Apart from a handful of low budget movies, Weller has done the voice for Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1 & Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 2...random? Ronnie Cox, as we know from Eddie Murphy's Beverly Hills Cop, was then and maybe still an accomplished actor playing numerous roles of good and bad. Kurtwood Smith made appearances in Deep Impact, Rambo 3, Broken Arrow and many more. Apart from its cheesy one liners, Robocop is and always will be one of my Childhood favorites. I know, it was strictly 18's (strictly), there was just no way I wasn't watching this movie. Unfortunately I can't say the same for what was to follow. I am sure the majority of fans will agree if I say that RoboCop 2 was mediocre, although it will never, NEVER be as bad as RoboCop 3!!! It is hardly worth referencing, but I believe the situation was played out with Peter Weller witnessing a script that read Robotic Ninjas and immediately decided to shove the pen he was given up the writers ass! For those who don't know, a re-make is set for release in 2013, with a cast Gary Oldman, Joel Kinnaman and Samuel L. Jackson. At this stage I struggle to see how anything can go wrong when the legendary Gary Oldman is involved. Joel Kinnaman is the star of the murderous TV series, The Killing. As for Samuel Jackson?... Overall: 80's Sci-fi action, 80's bloodshed, 80's acting = a dam good time! Did you enjoy my review? check out my previous and up to date reviews at my blog - http://gerrysreviewsforthosecurious.blogspot.com/" "At the time this movie came out, RoboCop addressed a lot of issues that were occurring at the time. The plot was actually your regular cop drama but with science fiction twist inserted right in the middle. Writers Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner have made a film that not only makes us wish RoboCop was a real figure but also reveals the power struggle between the good-willed and corrupt individuals in and out of normal society. Then there's also director Paul Verhoeven who tops the whole project with his signature of blood, guts and more blood. As the well-known story goes, RoboCop was once a humble human being. His name was Alex Murphy, both portrayed by actor Peter Weller. And he does not become RoboCop until he is brutally murdered while trying to arrest a few gang thugs. Once Murphy is reborn as the ultimate killing machine, he then sets out to do what he was programmed to do. Weller gives a stellar performance as the cyborg that he is. The movement of RoboCop is very much applaudable. It gives the illusion that he's scanning, analyzing, and calculating his options for each situation that he's in. Don't you wish you could do that? Playing the thugs' leader is Clarence Boddicker, acted by Kurtwood Smith. Smith is so convincing with his character, that it almost seemed like he was having fun being Boddicker all the time! It's ironic because who would want to know him? Boddicker has no soft spots anywhere, for anyone. And there's a difference because he's not a psychotic killer; he's heartless. He's a five year old child who has a \"blow up things\" mindset in a forty year old man's body. He doesn't care what collateral damage he makes either as long as it satisfies him. Even weirder is the fact that some may find Smith's character more appealing that Weller's! Interestingly enough, RoboCop is able regain a bit of his humanity when he ends up running into one of Boddicker's pals. It's from there he starts to become conscious of who he was, what he had, and what he is now. And although RoboCop is not a big talker at first, he does have his moments of comedy and sadness, which will make the audience like his character a little more every time he's on screen. It was thoughtful of the writers to give RoboCop a part of his old life back, because otherwise there wouldn't be much for the audience to be happy about. Yes so he's now much more powerful than he was as a human, but what's it like now to be him? Thankfully, that question is answered and it's almost tear jerking at times. Note that I've only gone over the main characters. Now there's the topic of costume design and make-up effects. These two groups really had something going here. The idea of what RoboCop should look like is enthralling. What baffles me to this day is how they got it to look like the face of Peter Weller was stapled onto the front of a robotic head. These people literally had to know what they were getting themselves into when they signed onto this project. How to get a human being to look like that requires a lot of creativity. The action is good too. And by action, I define it as the amount of carnage. Whenever Paul Verhoeven makes a film, blood is a requirement and this film delivers it by the pint. It's not a gore festival but it is on the bloodbath scale. The music, composed and conducted by Basil Poledouris is a valuable element to the film as well. The movie has its own theme and it has light brushes sci-fi tunes in it too. It's a film that is hard not to enjoy. Noted as one the best science fiction films ever made, this film was a star-making role for Peter Weller. The violent scenes fit the tone perfectly as do the dramatic moments between them." "The black comedy is funny, although sometimes you feel bad laughing at so much violence, but the sideswipes are the best. Verhoeven takes digs at TV with his advert filled news broadcasts, at privatisation by showing the crumbling police stations and the huge corporate towers and at heroism by showing Robocop creating just as much mayhem and destruction as the criminals he pursues. His strength however is the action scenes and the sense of tension he creates - I'll don't think anyone can forget the sheer terror of ED209's 'glitch'. Weller is good - cast because of his strong jaw and ability to project emotion through a suit of armour - and he does manage to bring out the human side. Allen is good but a but dry. The real support comes from the eccentric, and well known villains and corporate bosses. Ronny Cox, Smith, Ray Wise, Perry, O'Herlihy and Miguel Ferrer are all great in various capacities. Criminal or greedy corporate leader - it's hard to tell which is which at times. A classic bit of sci-fi. Verhoeven has sadly not had a moment as fine as this since and has recently had problems being excessive in Hollywood - the land of excess! This is a landmark film that may not be to everyone's taste." "In theory, and from it's ridiculous title, Robocop is an incredibly silly film. The crime ridden streets of Detroit in the not-too-distant future, get a futuristic superhero, a knight in shining armour, from an omnipotent corporation OPC, to protect them from the criminals. However, what we actually get is a very emotional human story, along with some incredibly sharp satire. Murphy (Peter Weller), a police officer, is killed whilst on a mission with his new partner, Lewis (Nancy Allen). OCP (after a failed attempt at a robot-police programme) commissioned the Robocop program, and Murphy becomes the candidate. His memory is supposed to have been erased by the corporation however, he is reminded by Lewis of his identity. He pieces together the criminals that gunned him down after an incident with Emil (Paul McCrane), and uncovers the criminal machinations of corrupt, corporate business. As all good science fiction should, Robocop is partially allegorical of the times it was made in. In business, greed, power and wealth dominated (as highlighted in more explicit terms in another film of the same year, Oliver Stones Wall Street (1987), where \"greed is good\"). Here, violence and deceit are the tactics used to make it in the cut-throat business world. Miguel Ferrer's young, ambitious Bob Morton, and the older rival, Ronny Cox's Dick Jones, battle with each other to get their individual police-robot project's into production. Corruption was also an all pervading element of '80's business (something that was not new of course, we can go back in American history and find many corrupt governments and institutions, Tammany in New York is one example), and we see here the corporate elite working with the criminal underworld. The excesses of the 1980's greed is permeated within the excesses on screen. Violence is strong, yet comical at times. but it is always over the top. In an early scene, Dick Jones presents his product robot police officer, ED-209, a hulking, malevolent monster. In demonstration, ED-209 malfunctions and shoots an executive hundreds of times, to the point of joke. When Murphy is gunned down, we see his hand explode. Of course this reveals a corporate paranoia underneath some of the movies of the 80's. Each decades science fiction needs paranoia: In the 1950's and 60's it was communism and the nuclear bomb: in the 1970's and 80's it was political and corporate. The film is injected with some spot-on satirical humour. Adverts are seen throughout, further exacerbating the excesses of American culture at the time. We see commercials selling over-sized, gas guzzling automobiles (6000 SUX), replacement hearts (this clearly to alleviate the excesses on the body caused in the 80's), and a board game of the Battleship-kind (Nuke-Em). These along with the narrative create an almost perfect package. Directed by European Paul Verhoeven who epitomises the concept that the best way for America to hold a mirror up to itself, is to get outsiders to produce something that reflects the madness that was 1980's, Reagan-era, excess and greed. Not only does it offer a commentary, the humanistic, philosophical nature of the soul, is a strong (if often used) theme. Quite horrifically however, the film manifested into something terrible. I'm not talking about the sequels. The film was to be marketed for children, in the form of a cartoon series, and the inevitable action figures et al. So, like Gremlins (1984), this more \"adult\" fantasy, marketeers still had the moral sense (sic) to market violence to children - how lovely! www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "(www.plasticpals.com) RoboCop was one of the big hits of 1987, even though its title is a bit misleading (our hero is actually a cyborg, not a robot). It has much in common with the recent slew of comic super hero origin stories, but its R rating should not be taken lightly due to the shocking amount of gore. It's elevated above similar films through its satire of American culture, which include a number of broadcast news segments. Set in a crime-ridden future Detroit, a mega corporation wants to clean up the streets before they begin a massive building project. The corporation (OCP) is so huge that they have privatized the police force and have two separate robotics divisions working on automated solutions to Detroit's crime spree. One has developed a robot which malfunctions and subsequently obliterates an executive within the first ten minutes, and the other leads to the creation of RoboCop. The characters are almost totally one-dimensional, and we barely get to know officer Murphy before he undergoes his transformation. His character is further hampered because once Murphy's body is replaced with bionic parts, he doesn't speak very much. It doesn't work quite as well as in The Crow, another movie with a silent, seemingly invincible protagonist who has returned from the dead to seek revenge on those who murdered him. Most of the drama comes from the rivalry between two of OCP's executives, though there are some scenes where Murphy begins to remember his past life that give him some humanity. RoboCop's new abilities are surprisingly limited. Most of the time, the only thing that really distinguishes him from a human cop is his slow, deliberate walk and his bullet-proof armor. If made now, one would expect to see a much more agile and powerful version of the character. Now we've got movies like Iron Man, and video games like Deus Ex: Human Revolution which explore many of the same themes in a much more entertaining and intelligent fashion. That said, there's supposedly a remake in the works, which will be the 2nd Paul Verhoeven favorite to get the treatment after Total Recall (which is in production at the time of this writing). The core idea behind RoboCop isn't especially original, given that shows like The Six Million Dollar Man and characters like Darth Vader preceded it, but the way it all comes together is still pretty entertaining. There's some fun stop-motion animation effects for the ED 209 robot, and the hero is pure boyish wish fulfillment. Since its release RoboCop has become a cult classic amongst sci-fi film fans, and other than a few sequences where the image quality suffers, it holds up pretty well."

"*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "It's 24 years since I first saw this work at the movies and I'm still convinced it's very special. Paul Verhoeven brought to the screen a cyborg that was actually more believable than The Terminator. And although it wasn't an assassin; it didn't mess around either. That additional touch of humanity gave it great depth. He also assembled a B-movie cast that were perfectly matched and contrasted in characters & temperaments. They're the most naturally believable group of players. It's the future. And it's in Detroit, for a change. Paul Weller plays Murphy, a smart young cop trying to be a good husband and father-figure. During a heist he is ambushed by the villains and murdered. A high-tech corporation owns the franchise for law & order. They take his brain and fit it into a cybernetic body. Nancy Allen plays his partner and would-be friend, Lewis. Arch-crook who lead that ambush and most of Detroit's crimewave is Clarence Boddicker, played with wonderfully sleazy panache by Kurtwood Smith (a villain called Clarence?). Ronny Cox makes an equally greaseball executive insider. Dan O'Herlihy plays the corporate CEO. They, and a few others, are absolutely the business. Verhoeven's works are notoriously violent and this movie set his template. Yet, it's more than just violent; it's ironic and hilariously witty at times, though the comedy is often very dark. There's a host of memorable one-liners with hints of 'Dirty Harry'. But here, there's something else - a sly little comment about the relevance and even remanence of human identity. Post cyborg 'Robocop' Murphy, who is supposed to be a simple programme, begins having flashbacks. Soon, the greater part of his memory begins returning. In particular, recollections of his - now - widow, son and home re-surface. Verhoeven handles these curiously under-explored issues with quite an amazing subtlety. Murphy knows what he is. But now he must come to terms with what he's lost. Spielberg's 'Bicentennial Man' spent more than 2 hours and yet said nothing more. No one-issue dominates here. Verhoeven keeps the plot moving fast. With his re-awakening come memories of his murder. His cyborg half employs technology to trace the culprits, his human half wants revenge. On top of all this come special-effects that still hold good today. A shoot-out between himself and a giant robot inside the plush suite of executive offices is quite awesome. Whist slipped-in between takes, are spontaneous depictions of topical newscasts both hilarious & terrible. I've given this movie 10 stars because what it does, it does without flaw. It's seminally violent, hilarious, spontaneous, fast-moving, well-acted, smartly-scripted, untypically thought-provoking, with great special-effects. Finally; it's amalgamation of political prostitution, corporate cynicism, and tenuous morality is probably a closer representation of our dystopian future than many more celebrated works. This movie is a classic." "Possibly one of the best comic book adaptations of the 1980s wasn't even based on a comic property. Although he didn't get involved with the franchise until the second and third installments, comic legend Frank Miller's influence is smeared all over the first Robocop. Borrowing a heavy handed anti-establishment vibe, nacho cheesy looked-better-on-paper dialog, enough gratuitous violence to make a Troma flick turn away and stereotypical corporate bigwigs around every corner, I wouldn't be surprised to learn Miller had more than a passing investment in Paul Verhoeven's futurist nightmare. Of course, it could also be that Miller's influence on the comic medium as a whole was responsible for many of these parallels. Either way, it's a dream come true for fans of the dark, gritty graphic novels that made their mark in this era. It's also far from the most expertly crafted picture, with a carefree, cavalier attitude that seeps into the acting, cinematography, special effects and storyline. Arms are blown off just for the fun of it. Speeding automobiles barrel over evildoers in lieu of a more coherent way to write them out. Strongholds erupt into geysers of fire. As with Rambo before it, the lesson of the day is wanton brutality and the titular hero is your celebrated instructor. Despite its immeasurable shortcomings as a motion picture, that blunt approach to both villain and viewer alike makes it tough to turn off. A night with Robocop is like eating an entire bag of candies in one sitting; there's more nourishing, appetizing stuff out there and we know it's wrong... but sometimes it's impossible to fight that compulsion." "This movie predicted the merging of police and technology company 20 years before it happened. Now police profiling, and suspect location is a matter of technology with our chipped passports, and drivers license that can passively monitor our locations, and hold our biometric informations. Robocop is a product of OCP more so than its a police officer. This mars what \"justice\" is depending on who's view point it is. Alex Murphy gets murdered during investigation. OCP is looking for a \"brain\" that will emotionally survive its transplant into a cybernetic body. They find it in Murphy, and transforms him into Robocop. Murphy or Robocop goes about its business, but subliminally, it still harbors memory of its murder and family. He's on the chase of gangs that killed him. This results in investigation leading back to OCP, but will OCP allow its product to conduct police action on itself ? Ground breaking low budget science fiction thriller. Although there has been a cop turned into robot idea like the 8th Man by Jiro Kuwata, and Kazumasa Hirai, this is the first live action movie of its type. There're lot of what ifs that are explored in this movie, and the design of the technology is so good that it makes this movie believable. The movie had the sober look into the future society where corporate control influences the course of the society even more significantly than what was thought possible at the time, and present it in an entertaining action science fiction. In this sense, this movie scores high as we don't have Robocops yet, but our society is heading in that direction. Great movie that's exciting and believable with lot of drama all mixed in." "In a dystopic & crime ridden Detroit, a terminally wounded cop returns to the force as a powerful cyborg with submerged memories haunting him. One of the movies where your bored, want some entertainment, and a movie pops up wanting to be watched. You watch it, not expecting much, and results vary. Either the movie was expectantly bad or the movie actually draws you in with an intelligent plot that delivers in all sorts of ways, with amazing action and amazing scenes; the movie unexpectedly takes you by it's wheel and unexpectedly shocks you with true awesomeness. Oh yeah, Robocop is the second one. With a dystopic future and intelligent and highly possible ideas, Robocop actually scores in all ways possible. The action was piercing, Robocop gets the job done and it is overall amazing. This ties in equally with the foreshadowed special effects. From the older copy of Robocop, the technology was growing older and more developed. I was actually awe-inspired even seeing this in 2011, it is seriously awesome. The acting was alright, never expected high class and received. I loved the structure of the film as well, although meaningless, the film scatters news segments and TV commercials that tie-in with the plot. The beginning of Robocop's departure into law enforcement, the action gets gritter, the film gets meaner, and everything just tugs it way forward to even more awesome. Then we have the last thing that needs to be discussed: the heart. Wait, an action film like Robocop contains heart? Yes. And it works too, with Robocop's memory slithering it's way into his robotic mind, you can't help but to feel. Not like it's the main theme, but it is overgrowing and it unexpectedly worked for the film. I overall have no complains for the film, it was a totally unexpected masterpiece. Everything was done well, and it reaches peaks those held by the Terminator. Robocop is definitely not for everyone, but those who dislike, must reconsider their liking's; as Robocop is a must-see! 9/10." "I didn't really get a chance to watch this film when it came out and didn't got around to seeing it for a very long time. But because of all the hype it was getting I decided to watch it, I can now see why this movie has so many following. This is a brilliant sci-fi flick and the direction and pacing of it all is very well done and will keep most audiences attention despite it being a bit outdated. The special effects are outdated now, but the direction and how everything progresses makes the experience exhilarating and thrilling to watch. It even has some tension to some degree because of the set pieces and because of the attachment to the main character. This movie also has a lot of action sequences and those sequences are shot in a entertaining manner although a bit over the top at times. Any action movie fans or sci-fi fans should most definitely check this movie out. I also liked the commercial breaks in between some scenes in this that was meant for the movie because of it's humor, same with the broadcasts which adds to the movie in a positive way. 8.4/10" "\"Robocop\" is one of those great sci-fi movie's next to, \"Terminator\" and \"Star Wars\". The story is about a Rookie Cop that get's killed by gangsters and he end's up getting repaired by scientists and end's up becoming a police cyborg called, Robocop. What make's this movie really great is that it had some nice action scene's, the story was good, some nice acting from Peter Weller as the main protagonist and Kurtwood Smith(Who was known for playing Red in, \"That 70's Show\") as one of the villain's in the movie, and the movie had some funny moments that will make you laugh. Overall, \"Robocop\", is a great sci-fi movie to watch if you're into sci-fi movie's or trying to look for a good movie to watch." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "RoboCop is a great action flick! It is not for people who are faint of heart at all because this movie originally had an X rating for a reason, if there was NC-17 rating systems back then this movie definitely would have qualified for it. I won't get into details but this is definitely a hard rated R movie that children should not be allowed to see. Murphy's \"death\" scene near the beginning where he is cruelly gunned down and shot to pieces over a stretched out period of time by psychotic criminals (led by the dad from That 70s Show unbelievably) is hard to stomach. Also the scene near the end where one of the bad guy's henchmen is kind of melted by dangerous acidic chemicals then blows up when he is run over by a van is disgusting too. This movie doesn't pull any punches with the blood and gore quotient and there is also a lot of funny dark humour in it too. I love this flick but make sure to notice how blood and gutsy it is before you watch it!" "Science Fiction films have come a long way since the early days of movie making. Stories about alien or future worlds were more difficult to realize back then, but with advances in technology this would change. George Lucas's first 'Star Wars' film showed that so much more was possible and it was a sign of things to come. Had it never been made we wouldn't likely have films like 'Blade Runner,' 'Total Recall,' or 'Avatar,' or at least not for many more years. 'The Terminator' is another great example of this and introduced the world to what was probably the baddest cyborg to that date. Three years later we see the opposite side of this when a humble police officer was brought back as a kind of super cop to rid the modern world of \"waste.\" Instead of being a pale imitation of that earlier classic, 'Robocop' would become a hit in it's own right and remains one of the greatest of it's kind all these years later. Pros: Universally strong cast. Neat concept. Electrifying score. Awesome effects. Quick paced. Has a cool futuristic look and feel to it. Has quite a mean streak. Plenty of exciting and well staged action sequences. Fabulous direction. Has some great social commentary. Cons: Despite being set in the future, some things age the film. The effects that were added in post aren't so seamless anymore. Final thoughts: So many action packed movies lack heart, but 'Robocop' had more to offer than explosions, car chases, and gunfire. The character of the title is like a modern superhero and the film itself is an absolute smash. It easily deserves a spot in line with all the other great Science Fiction films. My rating: 4.5/5" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Excellent Action/Sci-fi/Drama. Plot: After being brutally killed by a gang of criminals, a cop is resurrected by a megacorporation,becoming a cyborg police officer to protect a futuristic Detroit. The memory of his family and his old life is erased, but somehow comes back to him over the course of the movie. How he died comes back to him which causes him to seek revenge. Directed by Paul Verhoeven(Total Recall, Basic Instinct, Showgirls, and Starship Troopers) the movie blends bloody action violence with elements of drama. Some of the parts are actually kind of sad. Robocop isn't just some cyborg who's only mind set is to protect and serve. He's trying to find his former identity.I thought that brought a lot more character depth. Peter Weller is awesome as Robocop/Alexander James Murphy. I was very surprised to see Kurtwood Smith in this. I've always known him as the hard*** dad from That 70's Show. The dialogue is funny but not bad just as Verhoeven's Starship Troopers(One of my favorite Sci-fi/Drama's of all time) and some of the deaths are so overdone they actually become funny." "After I watched RoboCop on TV, I loved it, but when I bought the DVD, I loved it even more!!!! Since I watched movies on TV, they attend to ruin certain dialog, they have to cut scenes out, dubbing, and content (ex. blood, gore, nudity, language, sexual references). But it's better to get them uncut to see the original movie. It stars Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, Dan O'Herlihy, Ronny Cox, Kurtwood Smith, Miguel Ferrer, etc. After Omni Consumer Products (OCP) announced that it bought out the Detroit police department, the department decides to go on strike. Alex Murphy (Peter Weller), gets transferred from Metro South to the West. He and his partner, Anne Lewis, track down a group of criminals led by Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith). Unfortunately, Murphy was killed by Clarence's gang. Bob Morton, one of OCP's employees, transforms Murphy's corpse into Robocop, to compete with another employee Dick Jones' ED-209. Robocop's tests are successful. Unfortunately, Robocop rediscovers his memories (when he was Alex Murphy), and now knows he has to find and arrest Clarence Boddicker. He realizes that Clarence is working for Bob Morton's competition Dick Jones. Now, Robocop must stop both Clarence and Dick Jones. As far as his directing goes, it was pretty good when he did Basic Instinct, his directing went downhill when he directed that awful movie Showgirls, but he returns to his roots by directing Starship Troopers. I have never owned the sequels, Never seen RoboCop 2, but I never liked RoboCop 3. Overall, one of the best action movies ever made. RoboCop gets 10 stars."

"*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This is one of those movies that really embarrasses a lot of filmmakers. Robocop is the story of a police officer in a crime-ridden Detroit of the future who gets killed and turned into a cyborg law enforcer who must find those responsible for his death and reclaim his lost humanity. There have been hundreds, maybe a couple thousand, of sci-fi action movies where the basic premise of the story is at least as good as that. Yet, the overwhelming majority of those films suck really hard, while Robocop is one of the best action films of its era. In Robocop, a corporation called Omni Consumer Products is running the police force for the city of Detroit. The head of OCP (Michael O'Herlihy) wants to build a new development called Delta City in place of old Detroit, but first they need to find a way to control the raging crime wave that's crippling the city. The number 2 man at OCP is Dick Jones (Ronny Cox), but when his plan to patrol Detroit with robots fails spectacularly during a board meeting, ambitious young executive Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer) seizes the moment to get The Old Man to approve his alternative Robocop program. That program involves moving likely candidates on the police force into high crime, high violence precincts and waiting for one of them to die. The cop who gets \"lucky\" is Murphy (Peter Weller) by being horrifically gunned down by the charismatic crime boss of Detroit, Clarence Boddiker (Kurtwood Smith), and his gang. Murphy's corpse is claimed by OCP and transformed into Robocop, who launches a one-cyborg war on crime and becomes a media sensation. But then Murphy discovers the secrets behind OCP and his transformation and, with his old partner Lewis (Nancy Allen), brings the real bad guys to graphically violent justice. This is a great movie. The acting is great. The writing is great. T he direction is great. The costumes are great. The special effects (aside from some stop-motion animation that looks a little dated) are great. Robocop is one of the films that helped make the 1980s the Golden Age of the action movie. One of the best things about the film is the way the story deals with the concept of the super-human or the super-hero. Murphy is transformed by tragedy into something more than human, but the triumph of the character isn't in using his inhuman power to battle the bad guys, it's in his struggle to reassert his humanity. I once read a review that called Robocop one of the greatest super-hero origin stories ever because it recognizes and emphasizes that the important thing about the super-hero isn't the power or the costume or the codenameit's the real person inside all that. Robocop also has some of the best cultural commentary you'll ever see in an action movie. The movie creates and explores a wonderful contrast between the immorality of crime and the amorality of big business and makes you consider who is worse  those who deliberately set out to hurt people or those who just don't care who gets hurt in the pursuit of their agenda. Robocop is also notable for creating one of the most interesting \"worlds\" in sci-fi movie history. The corporatized, soulless society of future Detroit, the glimpses we get of the chaos elsewhere on Earth and the crude degeneracy of its popular culture are still compellingly perverse, even after 20+ years of the real world racing to catch up. If you like action movies, you have to see Robocop. Even if you don't like action movies, you should still watch Robocop, because if you don't like this film you can be sure you'll never like any action movie ever." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Set in the not too distant future, RoboCop is a dark satire of the media, corruption and the '80s boom of consumerism. Directed by Paul Verhoeven, it's got all of his trademarks, from explicit violence to groundbreaking special effects. I view RoboCop as sort of a prologue to Starship Troopers - we definitely see Verhoeven crafting his skills here, but this doesn't make it an amateur production - far from it. It's a basic story, which we've seen many times before - a cop, Alex Murphy, is almost killed by Clarence Bodicker, a bank robber with a foul mouth. We think he's dead - he is missing an arm, after all! He's revived by OCP, a mysterious corporation, who put him into a robotic body, the future in Law Enforcement. RoboCop isn't just a mindless action film - the storyline of OCP wanting to raze Detroit and build it again, parallels the refurbishment of towns in the early '80s, who wanted to make it more sophisticated. Overall, it's a nice change from the usual mindless action film, with nice hints of drama and satire. If you're looking for more, definitely see RoboCop 2, but you should probably skip number 3, where it all became a bit silly." "Robocop is easily a masterpiece of science fiction/action cinema and is possibly one of, if not the best sci-fi films along, in my opinion, with T2. The action scenes, especially RoboCop's final showdown with ED-209. The music is entertaining and fits the atmosphere of the film. And another thing I love is, a thing which is even more present in the X/NC-17 rated version of the film: the grittiness of not only the violence, but the film in general. The dark comedy is fitting, pops up at the appropriate times, and is actually quite funny. Peter Weller gives a tour de force performance as RoboCop. Even though you rarely see his face or him as a human, this film would undeniably not be the same without Weller as the titular character. Clarence Boddicker is also one of the greatest villains ever to be portrayed on the screen. All around, this film excels in everything a good action/sci-fi film should have: action, great CGI, great writing/directing, acting, music, atmosphere, a believable and frightening villain, a real plot, interesting setting, and something recent sic-fi/action flicks have been lacking; charm, heart, and wit." "Paul Verhoeven's greatest film to date, even better than Starship Troopers and Total Recall. The film later spawned a T.V. series and an animated cartoon series. Robocop is followed by Robocop 2 and Robocop 3. The sequels are AMAZINGLY NOT DIRECTED BY P. Verhoeven but by different directors and (sadly) not as good as the original. Plot: Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) a transferred Officer, just arrived at Detroit P.D. is told to suit up, meet with his new partner Officer Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen) and head out on patrol. On patrol they encounter Clarence Bodicker (Kurtwoord Smith in his most iconic role as a baddie) and his goons. They track him down to an abandoned factory, and enter it. Murphy is separated from his partner Lewis. He is caught by Bodicker's Goons and literally shot to pieces. His is airlifted to a hospital, but his wounds are too great and he expires. His body however is transferred discreetly to Omni Consumer Products (O.C.P) and they have a different agenda on their minds for Murphy...................... Watch this exciting film to find out. A must have film for any DVD collection." "In the 80's sci-fi/action classic, \"Robocop,\" Peter Weller plays newbie cop Alex Murphy, whom, after being ruthlessly gunned down by a crime boss and his cronies, is resurrected as a cyborg. As Robocop, Murphy is the ultimate in law enforcement, cleaning the streets of a crime-ridden Detroit (in a not too distant future that we have likely surpassed by now) all while being haunted by some unpleasant memories. \"Robocop\" is the breakthrough film from director Paul Verhoeven, whose reign over the action genre was short-lived but certainly left a mark. Like all of his best films, it pushes the envelope and the limits of good taste, all in the name of good entertainment. Verhoeven combines a bit of social commentary with his high-energy, over-the-top style, but thankfully, it still makes for a film that can be appreciated on a superficial level, too. It's just that \"Robocop\" matches its giddy goriness and intense action with some unexpected substance, and that's okay. All of this is achieved, of course, with the assistance of some solid special effects, stop-motion animation that surprisingly still looks good and a score that sticks in your head for days. In all honesty, though, there isn't much going in the character department. Peter Weller pulls through, and in spite of the fact that he isn't given much to do besides walk around in an obviously uncomfortable and cumbersome outfit, still manages to bring a human element to his Robocop counterpart. Kurtwood Smith (TV's \"That 70's Show\") lays it on a little thick as the main baddie but keeps the energy pumping through its final act, while Paul McCrane (TV's \"ER\") has perhaps the most memorable (read: revoltingly awesome) scene in the film. Verhoeven paces the film just right so that you don't have time to notice its lack of substantial characters and all you can do is just sit back and enjoy the ride. And what a great ride it is, as in spite of its minor flaws, \"Robocop\" still holds up and manages to entertain after all these years." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "\"Dick! You're Fired\"..... And so the plot of Robocop reaches it's zenith when Ronny Cox , \"meets his maker\" courtesy of an angry boss, a very angry cyborg and a classic \"Wilhelm Scream\"! Watching Robocop again in 2008 for the first time in maybe 20 years, I found it to be a thoroughly entertaining piece of work from director Paul Vorhoeven. No need to write too much here suffice to say that the best line comes at the end of the film when the aforementioned Mr Cox falls to his death(very similar to Frank Nitti'e death in The Untouchables, also a 1987 film!)after being blasted by Peter Weller's title character. Great performances from all concerned. Also terrific to see Miguel Ferrer with a full head of hair!!" "one of the funniest and most outrageously violent sci fi action pics; this deservedly classic piece of mayhem confirms the marvellously talented dutch film director paul verhoeven as a force to be reckoned with. special mention must be given to the dialogue (\"YOU CALL THIS A GLITCH!\" after a test robot riddles an excessive amount of bullets into an employee at a company conference) and hilarious swipes at corporate management (ticker tape share readings in the restroom). viva la' robocop!" "I hadn't seen this before because I thought the special effects would not be to good since it is an older movie. But, I was pleasantly surprised. Robocop looked cool. And the ED-209 machine did look really fake compared to today's effects,but it still wasn't bad. The satire, such as the TV commercials, throughout the movie was great. And I had no idea how violent and bloody this was or I would have seen it earlier. And the way the bad guys kill Murphy so he can become robocop is so disturbing because of their attitudes, just laughing and joking while someone gets their arm blown off. They definitely deserve what they got in the end. FINAL VERDICT: Your classic tale of revenge; this time with a half human/robot cop. Bloody violent, bloody good." "The perfect role for the young Leeza Gibbons: a completely superficial and insensitive TV news reader. For her, the movie was a foreshadowing. Miguel Ferrer sets the tone for his desultory career as the infamous Bob Morton. Who can forget the geeky bad guy who gets obliterated by the car after being dipped in toxic waste? Ka-blew-ie!!! Ewwwwwwwww!! And last but certainly not least: \"I'll buy THAT for a dollar!!\"" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** RoboCop(1987) on one level is an allegory on the death and rebirth of Jesus Christ. Its a topic that has been a fascination for artists almost more than anything else. Art's interest in the death and rebirth of Jesus is a continuous one. One of Paul Verhoeven's dream projects is to do a film on the topic of Jesus. The 4th Man(1984) also in certain moments was obsessed with the Jesus allegory presented in RoboCop(1987). Story makes many references to Jesus and Franenstein tales. After building up an impressive resume as an European cult film director, Paul Verhoeven in the mid 1980s decided to make it a try at Hollywood. RoboCop(1987) was his first and best Hollywood feature. When he made this, Paul Verhoeven showed some promise as a filmmaker who could take chances with taboo subject matters in Hollywood. American films since RoboCop(1987) have been dissapointments especially Starship Troopers(1997) and Hollow Man(2000). One exception of a good Hollywood film besides RoboCop(1987) is Total Recall(1990). It always saddens me when excellent foreign filmmakers(for most part) who come to Hollywood end up making mediocre films. RoboCop(1987) might have not been possible without box office success of The Terminator(1984). Like most things in cinema one form of movie always gives way to another. An interesting tidbit on RoboCop is that Arnold Schwarzenegger was considered as a canidate for main role. Due to the fact that Arnold was too big to fit into the RoboCop suit, the filmmakers went for Peter Wellar instead. RoboCop(1987) and The Terminator(1984) are two of the most influential SCIFI films of the 1980s. Look of the latter film is apparent in set designs of former. Violence in feature is shown with a dark humor approach. There are a few instants when violence enters the realm of comic books with over the top presentation. Disturbingly humorous is what I call the death of Kenny moment. Violent scenes are flamboyantly filmed by Paul Verhoeven. Some of the gore scenes are in the style of Lone Wolf and Cub, and Lucio Fulci. Daring way of showing violence that many in today's Hollywood would never do. A fun part in watching it is the cold blooded villainous performance of Kurtwood Smith. He plays his character with ability to act brutish and look intellectual at same time. You never would think just by looking at Clarence Boddicker with his bookish looks that he is a foul mouth murderer. Its funny to know that vicious bad guys are usually played by nice guys. Michael Ironside plays the same sort of character in Total Recall(1990). Editing of RoboCop(1987) is fantastic especially during the Mediabreak moments. Tangled in the satiric and violent web is a tragic tale of rediscovery. Focuses on a man who loses all that is precious to him including his human ways. The robotized Murphy is in essence in the same path as the replicants of Blade Runner(1982). Deals with similar ideas about identity and memory as Total Recall(1990). Identity and what it means to a person is the most important theme of RoboCop(1987). The main protagonist does at least get a portion of his past life which seemed lost to him. Mediabreak sequences are interludes to the main action of the plot. Mediabreak sequences and the commercials that follow them provide a humorous truth about American culture. The funniest commercial presented in the parody of the Battleship boardgame. Nancy Allen is excellent in what I think is her best role. Ronny Cox is menacing as the ruthless executive, Dick Jones. Miguel Ferrer does well in the role of the ambitious and arrogant Bob Morton. Aspect of RoboCop that story zeros in on is the dual nature of main character once he's transformed into RoboCop. Its at the moment of a dream that RoboCop begins to wonder about who he is. Peter Weller brings a lot of depth into the role to make Alex Murphy a tragic hero. Alex Murphy's death is shocking because of the way he's killed. As gruesome and over the top as any death scene in a Lucio Fulci film from the early 1980s. Its the kind of death scene one usually reserves for the end of a film. Works as a satire on the attitude and excess of the 1980s. Yuppie culture in RoboCop(1987) is shown as arrogant and obnoxious. 1980s culture has never been protrayed with the humorous edge lacking in most films about 1980s culture with exception of Heathers(1989). Rob Bottin provides some gruesome but impressive makeup effects for RoboCop. Ranks among Bottin's best work as makeup effects man alongside The Howling(1980), and The Thing(1982). Rob Bottin's effects for Murphy's bloody demise rivals anything by Tom Savini or Gianetto De Rossi. A subtle moment is when Murphy/RoboCop shoots at bottles of baby food wi help of his partner for aim. It represents the fact that RoboCop can never have children or have an intimate relationship with Lewis. A couple of action scenes are in the fashion of Hong Kong Heroic Bloodshed pics. RoboCop(1987) is made up of memorable set pieces which have their own impressive signature. Peter Weller's performance as a robot who regains his human face preemits Arnold Schwarzenegger's development of human traits in Terminator 2:Judgement Day(1991). One of the ten great SCIFI films made during the 1980s."

"I was thoroughly impressed when I first saw this in theaters and couldn't wait to get it on video. Nothing but eye candy from start to finish depicting a futuristic Detroit as both sterile and grimy (thanks to the Dallas and Pittsburgh filming locations). But I hate to say that today the film has lost a little of its punch and the special effects are obviously those of minatures rather than computer graphics. All the performances were outstanding, but the one I absolutely loved was Kurtwood Smith as Clarence, one of the greatest villains in movie history. He's not presented as some ugly, evil slimeball, but a very intelligent, slightly-built, soft-spoken, balding man with a violent streak. The action and settings are so comic book-like and even better, 80's corporate greed is satirized more than any film I've seen. Looking back, I wonder exactly the time period it's set in since everything is futuristic except the automobiles, but then again, I viewed it as a parody of 80's society. I've loved Paul Verhoeven's films before this (not his later ones except Total Recall and Starship Troopers), especially The Fourth Man and Soldier of Orange. I always found his casting choices to be odd, because he chooses actors, well known or unknown to star in his big-budget films. I thought his acting stock from Holland would have been perfect for this film; think about it: Rutger Hauer as Murphy/Robocop, Renee Soutendijk as Lewis, and Jeroen Krabbe as Dick Jones or Clarence. They have played Americans quite well before (strange since their native tongue is foreign), but I suppose Verhoeven knew what he was doing in this one. Forget the sequels, they were about the worst in history." "ROBOCOP is a great action movie, it's one of the best ever. I was a little too young when I first saw it on TV, but I've always liked it. This movie has great acting & great action & great direction which makes me proud to be half dutch! If you haven't seen, get it on DVD, it's Verhoeven's best! (not like HOLLOW MAN, that stupid movie.)" "This movie is great ! The director is great (he also make \"Basic Instinct\" and \"Showgirls\").It is very original , it is a thriller , SF , and is very violent too. It is much better than the sequels ...YOU WILL LOVE IT !!!!!" "RoboCop is one of the greatest action movies ever made. It was probably one of the most violent too. But it's one of those movies which the violence fits in really well with the plot. It takes place in the future, where Detroit is overrun by a major corporation, OCP, who just bought the police department and created a crime-fighting android that went horribly wrong. But to compensate for it, an executive creates RoboCop out of policeman Alex Murphy who was brutally gunned down by a gang of vicious cop killers. RoboCop goes on a streak of crime-fighting with great success but then he gets flashbacks of his human life and his main priority is to take out the men who killed him. But he doesn't know that those criminals are better protected than he thought. RoboCop is a definite triumph in action movies. I first saw this movie on ABC back in the late 80's and then rented afterwards and the amount of violence was much more extreme than it was on TV. It has great visual effects and sound(RoboCop has the coolest sounding gun in movie history). Unlike other reviewers I don't believe you should completely avoid the sequels, I thought they were good but I agree that they weren't as good as the first one. If it was still on, I would recommend seeing the TV show. Not one to miss but also not for the weak-stomached. 10/10" "The future is bleak. Street crime is spinning out of control and the police are losing officers at an alarming rate. Until more is done to support them, they are actually contemplating striking. Their job has gotten way too deadly. This is Detroit, the recent future. In an effort to provide the police with more funding, the city has allowed a private conglomerate, OCP, to buy the police department. OCP, a corporation which specializes in dabbling in public services (this is where the money is to be made-weapons for the military, medical services and supplies, etc.), has an interest in controlling crime. Not cleaning up crime, but controlling crime. See, there is also big money to be made by accepting kick-backs. OCP has also committed millions, possibly billions of dollars to a major urban renewal project known as Delta City (\"The Future Has A Silver Lining\" reads a billboard which towers over an attempted rape). Nobody will live or work there if crime can't be controlled. And the investment is lost. OCP has a plan. Create the perfect cop. The assignment has been given to OCP second Dick Jones (Ronny Cox), a ruthless man his subordinates would never want to cross. However, his ED-209 program is not entirely practical. Seeing his chance, Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer), ambitious junior executive, picks up the ball and runs with it. Bob convinces \"The Old Man\" (Dan O'Herlihy) that his RoboCop plan is better. All he is waiting for is a cop to, how do we say, expire in the line of duty, which should happen any day now as he has restructured the police department to increase the risk of unknowing likely candidates. Bob is waiting for a \"volunteer\". And Dick Jones is not happy about any of this. This is the world director Paul Verhoeven has fashioned in his ultra-violent, wickedly funny (yes, funny!) \"RoboCop\". Everyone is in it for \"me\", greed is worn on the sleeve, and force is the way to get it. The screenplay, penned by Michael Miner and Edward Neumeier, is sharply written social commentary on everything from workplace politics to television (there are periodic recurring shots of different characters watching the same moronic TV comedy show which seems to be on at all hours, all days, all channels!). The pacing is quick, the action is graphic (mostly gunshot wounds), the camera use and production design is stylish. The music, composed by Basil Poledouris (\"Red Dawn\", \"The Hunt For Red October\", \"Starship Troopers\") is gripping. The acting is top notch by a group of veteran supporting character actors. Peter Weller, as Officer Alex Murphy, the \"volunteer\", is perfect for the role as a good family man caught in the middle of a situation he never expected. And Kurtwood Smith (\"That '70's Show\") as Clarence Boddicker, local crime boss who wants to control it all, is excellent. \"RoboCop\" is not typical sci-fi/sci-fantasy fare. There is real intelligence going on behind this script. Although set in the recent future, there is much for us to relate to now. Is this film a prophetic message? I don't know. But what I do know is that Paul Verhoeven's \"RoboCop\" is a very thrilling, enjoyable, stylish comic book on celluloid." "This one's a bit personal since I studied screenwriting under Michael Miner, one of Robocop's two creators. I remember seeing this film long before ever knowing one of its writers and I was impressed by the way the writers cloaked a message under a great deal of sci-fi technology and action. Sure, it was one vision of the future, but with the way technology was and is going coupled with the way corporate America wishes to control it, who's to say something like this futuristic world, gripped with crime could not happen? However, through it all, good still seems to survive and sometimes conquer insurmountable odds. Also, Robocop, the device created by the corporate greed machine, became an instrument for what was good and right. It even turned on the corporate types who would seek to use it for less than rightful purposes. I must admit that I recognize THIS film as the only Robocop saga worth mentioning. All of the others strayed from the creators' original vision." "I saw this film for the second time on television and although it portrayed a good idea based on a number of earlier man-made robotic super heroes, as with many such sci-fi films there is too much reliance on effects and not enough on the story. I fear that producers and scriptwriters seem to think that people who watch such films lack intelligence when quite the reverse is true. The idea that robots could one day be used to carry out law-enforcement may be a possibility but I suspect genetic engineering may take us in another direction when criminal tendency will be eliminated from humans when those all important genes will be modified, but then other forms of human failing will have to be treated. But that assumes that we shall not be replaced by robots for everything. The Robocop ends up being the good guy who kills the bad guy and the bad robot and who lives to make Robcop 2 and 3. The question that will always be asked is who decides what is good and right, the programmer or as one day he will be, the robot programmer who makes his descendents? But then that's been dealt with in the Exterminator films, or has it?" "Most of guys who did not see Verhoeven's previous Dutch films, could not say anything but action-packed or allegory of modern capitalism from RoboCop. His personal career- Doctoral degree of Science from Leiden, Seaman of Royal Dutch Navy, and radicalist in Dutch National Broadcasting Station- is flourished by his second work in the States. He has been continuously criticizing the absurdity of modern capitalism, world subordination theory, and partially the weird feeling of sexual oppression which everybody could experience in front of his/her personal encounter of momentum in his life history. Actually, the RoboCop is to satisfy the most simple audience who could not be fed up with violence and scientific mirage. However, that is just a matter of drawing full support from major studio (whether from the Orion or not). He depicted every tenet he eagerly wanted through his early Dutch works, and he succeeded!! Now that he succeeded in expressing what he wanted to, there is no reason for him to stick to the stinky sequels. That is why he refused the RoboCop 2" "It's the first time I give a 5 to a movie and still I have a little doubt in my mind. Not about the film in itself which is, in the science-fiction category, a must-have. The problem is elsewhere. In Robocop, you will see three different worlds pictured : a) The world of the leaders where iron (polished) and money reign. b) The world of the gangsters where iron (rotted) and guns reign. c) The world of the police related heroes where iron (Robocop) and friendship reign. And between or outside these worlds : nothing or almost nothing. A wife who disappears as soon as her husband dies, wars or tragedies you can only watch through controlled TV channels. To try to pass from a world to another is nothing but safe. In fact, death waits for you in this no-man's land. Except for Robocop. What the hell does Paul Verhoeven try to tell us by picturing this claustrophobic vision of the future ? That our future lies in a clear separation between economic or ethnic groups ? That only a charismatic and heartless leader will able to control the situation ? Frightful perspective, isn't it ? Or rejoicing view of the mind, Paul? O.K. I'm through. Let's just enjoy the show ! Action, good actors and beautiful gunfights. Who can ask for anything more ? WOW !" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "After OCP announces that its bought out the Detroit police department, the department decides to go on strike. Alex Murphy gets transferred from Metro South to the West. He and his partner, Anne Lewis, track down a group of criminals led by Clarence Boddicker. Unfortunately, Murphy is killed by Clarence. Bob Morton, one of OCP's employees, transforms Murphy's corpse into Robocop, to compete with Dick Jones' ED-209. Robocop's tests are successful but, he begins to rediscover memories, and now knows he has to find and arrest Clarence Boddicker. He discovers that Clarence is working for Dick Jones. Now, Robocop must stop both Clarence and Dick Jones...... Take whatever you want from Robocop, be it a metaphor for Jesus Christ, or a huge middle finger to private companies buying the world for ownership, its an amazing movie, and a timeless classic. Seller is great as the titular character, and he puts some real effort in once he is transformed,you really do forget that Weller is in the suit, and get lost into the whole cyborg thing. If you want to go along the Christ metaphor, he dies, gets resurrected, and for added effect, he walks on water, and Jones could be classed as Gabriel, his all from grace, depicted when the old man (god) fires him. It works in a sense, but doesn't hinder the flow of the narrative. The supporting cast are brilliant, and kudos to Smith, Cox, and McCrane for putting some of their best work in this movie. Set pieces are brilliant, and there really isn't much apart from the action in the movie, unless you count Verhoevens little stab at consumerism, with his little ad breaks. All in all, it's a brilliant almost perfect dystopian vision, very topical, very funny, and unbelievably, very real. One of the most important films released in the eighties."

"Though not as good as The Terminator, Robocop is solid. and if you haven't seen it yet, you really should. Set in Detroit in the not too distant future, officer Alex Murphy is killed in the line of duty one day, but he is brought back to life as a cyborg. He becomes the city government's latest experiment in law enforcement. For a while he does his duty without question, but he slowly gains memories of his old 'human' personality including his partner, his family, and more importantly his killers. When he goes after them, he discovers that they are working for a crooked government official. Our robo-hero must bring justice to the city. Robocop is a good blend of all the right elements, never getting to absurd or too dull. Up until the last five minutes, I didn't question the improbabilities of the movie, but the ending is not only too short and abrupt but it's silly. Unlike Terminator, It is a poor conclusion to the story, but knowing that the filmmakers had a sequel in mind (or even two) I suppose this error is forgivable. Coming from Paul Verhoeven, one should not be surprised that Robocop is a little more violent than it is suspenseful, but this is his most accomplished picture, and if there are any major flaws, than they will probably go unnoticed. Hurray for Robocop!" "I remember being about 15 and going to my local store and getting this film for the first time from a store that was known for giving films of a certain certificate to under age people (let's face it most of them did) and my 1st thought being what a fantastic film. Its only since i've got older that I have realised the message in the film is quite a bleak one. It is saying that if we continue in the direction we are taking as a world we will end up with lawless societies and basically global Armageddon. The story is directed by Paul Verhoeven (who else for such a task) and told in a dark and uncompromising fashion with excellent performances from Peter Weller and Nancy Allen (until then mainly known for being the chief bitch in Carrie) but all involved play their parts extremely well. The directors cut is the definitive version of this film as it adds more depth to the story and explains it better. It really is a classic of its genre and many films have tried to copy it but none can compare. Fantastic." "***1/2 Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, Dan O' Herlihy, Kurtwood Smith, Ronny Cox and Miguel Ferrer. Directed by Paul Verhoever. The smash hit for sci-fi geeks and a movie for cops too, grisly and fascinating at the same time non-stop action with a few catchy lines in the mix. New comer police officer Alex Murphy (Weller) hot on the trail of bank robber Clarince Bobbicker (Smith; a role born to play) is soon bombarded by bullets and left for dead. Soon after high authority suit types decide to make him the ultimate law enforcer Robocop (Weller). Going through some nasty crimes and upholding the law everywhere he goes and piecing together who he really is, Robocop has become a science fiction phenomenon. Taking pieces of grunge cop \"Dirty Harry\" with the unstoppable metallic armor of James Cameron's \"The Terminator\". Kick-ass flick for the eighties and a life teaching lesson for crooks and criminals. My final rating 8/10." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "RoboCop is arguably one of the best cyborg movies of all time. Peter Weller's performance as RoboCop is touching and tough at the same time. The rest of the cast, Nancy Allen, Robert DoQui, Miguel Ferrer give great performances along with the villainous Kurtwood Smith (RoboCop's murderer), Ray Wise and the sadistic Ronny Cox who plays the corrupt OCP businessman Dick Jones, he steals the show and in many ways is more evil than Kurtwood Smith. RoboCop starts with the police force considering going on strike, and then Alex Murphy (aka RoboCop) comes in the scene. Whilst out on patrol with his new partner (Lewis), they chase a group of heavily armed bank robbers to an old mill. They split up, and Murphy is blown away (quite literally) by the crooks. You can guess the next bit, he's brought back as RoboCop, and starts going out and fighting crime, until he starts to remember parts of his past and goes out looking for answers as to his identity. The film has some very good yet dark humour. The news and advertisement brakes take a comical yet dark look at American society. RoboCop addresses big issues, such as the American society, the human sole, and the role of a police officer. Another great thing about this film was the way that OCP (the main company in the story, the ones that put RoboCop together) is portrayed. It is shown as a corrupt products company with all the members trying to kill each other. Literally. But the whole thing is headed by an old man that seems to have some integrity, only to be out shined by the sinister Dick Jones. However the film is does have some problems. . The script in some places isn't very good, but it's not as bad as it could have been. The Special effects are pretty lame, but this was made almost twenty years ago, and the film didn't have a very big budget, so I'll let this one off. Probably the biggest problem was the violence. Okay, its a movie about crime and cyborg, and of course there is going to be some violence in here. But it's just plain excessive at many points, particularly were Murphy gets killed. It's just not necessary and appalling for it to be that violent. But Paul Verhovan's film making makes all these problems seem not as bad as you would really think. He makes a masterpiece. RoboCop, in my opinion, is better than ANY of the Terminator films, however as a series, the Terminator wins on a forfeit. The original RoboCop is probably the only film in the series worth watching. RoboCop 2 did have a lot going for it, but poor film making just ruined it. THe only way to describe RoboCop 2 is...well, a mess. The plot is allover the place. And RoboCop 3, don't even get me started on RoboCop 3. Verdict. RoboCop is by far one of the best films of our time, however the appalling levels of violence is keeping me from giving this film a 10. 8/10." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "I have always been ambivalent towards the films of Paul Verhoeven. In my personal experience, his work has been marred by his excesses. Don't get me wrong; I like sex and violence in movies as much as anyone else, but this guy really overdoes it. His worst film to date, \"Showgirls,\" wallows in sensationalism for its own sake; he includes plenty of nudity but barely any plot to speak of. However, he found a solid middle ground in \"Robocop,\" my favorite of his films thus far. While it contains as much violence as you'd expect (more if you watch the director's cut), it's counterbalanced by a well-crafted storyline, a compelling \"man vs. machine\" theme, and even some social criticism. This is not an entirely serious science-fiction movie. It is as much a social satire as anything else. This aspect of the film is established from the start with the first of many jabs at media and corporate culture. A very cynical view is taken of such institutions, which are seen as corrupt to the core. The satiric elements were necessary to offset the brutality of many scenes. Otherwise, it would have been too bleak and nasty to recommend, a problem that would plague its first sequel. The cold-blooded murder of the protagonist, a dedicated police officer, is extremely graphic and brutal, even for Verhoeven. This scene, and the character's subsequent resurrection as Robocop, is highly riveting. There are other gruesome scenes, sufficiently graphic to originally warrant an X rating from the MPAA. Even now, this comes off as a borderline NC-17 movie. I was intrigued by the central dilemma facing Robocop; although much of his original memory was purged, he still retains enough of his humanity to realize who he is and what's become of him. In one of the most compelling scenes, he accesses the crime database to identify his previous incarnation--and his killers. His mission becomes purely personal, conflicting with his new programming. At one point, he visits his former home (now up for sale), haunted by memories of his past family. He remembers what OCP wanted him to forget; how can he proceed with this newfound knowledge? This type of movie needs a good villain. Kurtwood Smith is more than up to the task; his character, a ruthless drug lord, is extremely vicious and nasty, even for an action villain. In one early scene, he throws his henchman out of a getaway truck just to throw off his pursuers. When he murders Robocop's old human self, he is genuinely enjoying his actions, the mark of a true sadist. In a later scene, Robo returns to give him a good beating, and the scene is one of pure satisfaction to the viewer, as comeuppance is imposed on a character who truly deserves it. Another good supporting performance comes from the solid Nancy Allen as the protagonist's former partner, who is the first to recognize him, and eventually proves to be his salvation. As the title character, Peter Weller is adequate, though countless other performers would have done just as well in the role. Verhoeven's vision of the future is a bleak, dystrophic urban wasteland, a shadow of Detriot's former glory as a major industrial city. At times it even seems like a postapocalyptic setting. He keeps the film moving at a thrill-a-minute pace, yet allows for the human elements of the story to shine through, delivering a movie that is more than just another generic thriller. It's most glaring flaw is not quite knowing how to end. The bad guy bites the dust, and Robocop gets his revenge; yet it isn't quite worthy of what went on before. *** (out of ****) Released by Orion Pictures" "Robocop is way better and more violent than the Terminator. It was very interesting, and more sci-fi than the sequels. But it is a classic, and it's going to stay that way, plus the special effects were pretty good for it's 1987 year and a cheap movie company known as Orion Pictures." "Over the top action comedy is drop dead hilarious such as when Bobby is thrown from the van or Murphy having his hand blown off & when the assistant is shot several by Ed-209.The movie also has funny one liners:''What is this sh*t !''. Rating:***** (out of five)" "Robocop is an awesome movie. It is probably one of the most graphically violent ever. I saw it when I was eight in the theater and for years dreamt of one day making a movie as violent. Sure it has minimal plot and only tolerable acting but you can't get a much more entertaining movie. Dutch director Paul Verhoeven who's directing has also brought us Total Recall and Starship Troopers has his finger on the pulse of what young American males want to see. The extreme violence in this movie is occasionally broken up by moments of sheer brilliant humor. Such as the mock commercials. I'm not a supporter of DVD but my friend has one and he got the director's cut of Robocop for even more violence. Either way this movie rocks." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Robobcop is the greatest film ever. Time travelling robots, car chases, head disasters,guts, killings, excitements, great graphics. As many have reviewed it, I'll give a plot summary and offer my favourite quotings. It's the future. Crime is everywhere, cops are overrun. Bad guys rule the cops. Everyone watches silly TV shows involving cakes and breasts: Bixby: I'd buy that for tree fiddy! Murph joins the cops. On his first day he is murdered by baddies. In an exhilarating chase the baddie boss sacrifices one of his own men:Clarence: Can you fly, Blobby? Smurf catches a couple of the bad guys, but the tables turn when he is outnumbered: Emil: (pointing a shotgun at Murphy) Your hide is mine! Clarence: No. Nat ya da da! Lead baddie Clarence Bodyguard gives his reasons for massacre:Clarence: See, I got this problem, so I do. I don't like cops so I don't. NANANANANANA! (blowing Murphy's hand off) Clarence: Not so handy now, are ya? This is all very amusing so one of the camp bad guys quips: Joe: Ooh I bet that's gotta sting, well you see now that's the thing, 'bout being shot 300 times. Ooh my boys, he speaks, he rhymes! Morse dies while his partner Lewis watches. Campy Joe quips as they leave: Joe: Nighty night, sleep well my friend. Oops, that's right, you're bucking dead! The company which looks after the city's police force, OCD, has been looking for new ways to solve crime. Dick Johns has created a monster called Ed20head which he believes will work. He presents it to the committee in a delightful scenario which reminded me of school drama club: (Kinney points a pistol at ED209) ED: Please put down your weapon. You have 20 seconds to comply. Dick: Do as he says. (Kinney drops the pistol but ED advances) ED: What did I just say, scumbag? Kinney: I did what you said. I did what you said! ED: Oh, back chat me will you? (ED opens fire and shreds Kinney) Dirk's boss is very disappointed at this glitch. Up and comer Bob Monkhouse steps up to the dish and offers his solution- a time travelling robot they captured which can be reprogrammed with the mind of a dead cop. Dick (secretly the crime lord boss) isn't happy. They use Murray's Brain: Bob: You're gonna be a bad mother-crusher! He's unstoppable. All he needs is 12 hours sleep a day, and a special type of robot food: Johnson: Tastes like baby food! Morton: I prefer rusks. He follows set orders: Morton: What are your Prime Directives? Robo: Shooting bad guys in the balls, eating baby food, your clothes, your boots, and your motorcycle. Robo immediately gets to work on killing criminals and saving the day creating his own classic quotes along the way: Robo: You feel lucky, Creep? Well, do ya? Robo: Thank you for your cooperation. Adios! Robo: Dead or alive, you are going to die. He is an internet sensation, bigger than the Beaters: Reporter: Excuse me, Robo, any special message for all the kids watching at home? Robo: Stay away from my bins. Dick's angry that his plan for world domination has been destroyed. He speaks to Bob about respect before having him killed: Dick: I used to call the old man funny names. Smelley pants. Boner. Once I even called him...\"Bum face.\" Murphy has been having nightmares about being killed, and decides to go after the gang: (Dragging Leon Nash by the hair) Robo: Who killed Laura Palmer? This leads to a shootout with motorcycles, helicopters, and sharks in a warehouse: Robo: Come quietly or there will be... trouble. Steve: Oh... yeah? (cocks shotgun)Hasta la vista, baby! (fires) Clarence was celebrating his birthday and is surprised by all the presents: Clarence: Oooh. buns, buns, buns! He isn't happy when Robert arrests him, but knows his rights: Clarence: Just give me my funning phone call. He phones Dick who says Robobo must be killed. He gives Clarence new guns so they can kill Robotinator: Joe: Whoa, a new toy. Can I play? Clarence: Buy your own, hippy. Robo finds them and begins his final confrontation with the help of Louise. Campy Joe is his first victim: Robo: Looking for me? (shoots Joe)Does it hurt? Does it hurt? He drops Emilio into a vat of Toxic Waste (he returns in the sequel as bad guy The Jokey Man): Emil: (after taking an acid bath) It Burns! He kills Clarence and the rest of the gang but Louie is hurt: Lewis: Murphy... I'm a mess... Robo: Soiling oneself is a common problem in earthlings. Robo goes to OCD headquarters to arrest Dick, but can't due to a fourth directive in his database. Dick explains his actions: Dick: I had to kill Bob Morton because he made a mistake. Now it's time to erase that mistake. (Attacks Robo with an eraser on the end of a giant pencil) The Wee Man realises what has been happening: Old Man: Dick, you're fired! (Directive 4 is cancelled) Robo: Dick, you're fired! (shoots Jones) Due to budget constraints the following quote was left in as they couldn't afford to re-film it: Old Man: Nice shooting, son. What's your name? Robo: em. Paul Weller? Best Scene: When Robo sticks the metal blade out of his arm through a robber who dared to steal a carton of milk. It goes through the carton, through bad guy's mouth, and out the back of his head!" "If \"Robocop\" was first released today, it would probably not create much fanfare. However, when it was launched in 1987, \"Robocop\" became a true legend: Everybody had at least heard the term \"robocop\" coined in the synonymous film, a term that gradually became a part of everyday slang. As for the film itself, it proved to be a huge success, it set a new trend in action films, and it was followed by (unfortunately worse) sequels; even a TV series was created featuring Alex Murphy, the famous law enforcing human-machine Robocop. So what was so special about \"Robocop\", back then? Well, the short answer should be \"the innovative story\". The film is about a not-so-distant bleak future (today this future unfortunately looks even closer to us...), in which greed and violence prevail, while the private sector takes care of everything, with its focus being in maximizing its profit instead of serving the public (sounds familiar?). In Detroit, OCP company is in charge of running the police (among other activities), but the crime is still rife, with villain Clarence Boddicker (Smith) spreading terror all around. To this end, the number two of OCP Dick Jones (Cox) presents a powerful robot-policeman named ED209, which promises to solve all the city's problems. However, the presentation of ED209 ends in bloodshed and fails miserably, giving the opportunity to a young OCP executive to present his own project, instead: Robocop. Robocop consists of a human policeman Alex Murphy (Weller) who had been killed in action, and has been re-constructed from scratch by the addition of several mechanical parts to his body and the erasure of his memory. The Robocop project proves to be a huge success, as Robocop manages to pacify the city and become a hero to its citizens. However, there are two problems: The first is that Robocop still has memories of his human past which haunt him; these memories become more intense when his former partner, officer Anne Lewis (Allen), realizes who he is, and she explains the missing gaps to him. The second and far more serious problem is that Jones is not happy at all with the turn of events, and so he is ruthlessly determined to destroy both the Robocop project and its creator. Today the above story might not raise so many eyebrows, but back then, it was a really innovative and exciting script. Verhoeven did a superb direction, with many cool (for 1987 standards) visual effects also stealing the show. However, the film still had a few shortcomings: The acting was just average, while the plot still had room for some more twists and a little less predictability. Nevertheless, the result was good, and despite the film's evident age today, its still gets easily a 7/10."

"SINCE I mentioned 'RoboCop' yesterday in my review of 'Total Recall', I'll delve a bit deeper into it today. As I mentioned before, director Verhoeven expresses his concerns about the power of corporations in this flick, but his main concern is about the robot's ability to regain his humanity. Viewers will know that the cop, Murphy, was killed by white gangsters and then outfitted with a robot's mind and body. However, he begins to have dreams about his past life with his family and these lead him to the realization that he was human. His humanity then bursts through the metal and wires to grab control of his mind, and in the final showdown with the corporate baddies, he knocks them off with ease and maintains his demeanor. In a sidebar, the gangster who conducts the most nefarious killings is a white guy, who is a puppet to the white head honcho. In two popular films in the 1980s, 'Witness' and 'Ghost', the head honchos were whites but the baddies who did the killings were minorities. So, it was a pleasant surprise to see a white baddie doing most of the killings in 'RoboCop'." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, Miguel Ferrer, Kurtwood Smith, Ronny Cox and Dan O'Herlihy star in this 1987 sci-fi/action film. This takes place in Detroit, Michigan where we meet cop, Alex Murphy (Weller) who's just transferred from another department. He meets new partner, Anne Lewis (Allen) and he's killed after they attempt to arrest a vicious gang led by Clarence Boddicker (Smith). Soon, Murphy becomes a cyborg, Robocop ran by company, OCP (Omni Consumer Products) headed by vice president, Bob Morton (Ferrer). Robocop starts getting flashbacks of his family and the gang that killed him. He seeks revenge and goes after Clarence's gang members saving him for last. Meanwhile, Dick Jones (Cox) is a corrupt executive at OCP who hates Bob and has him killed by Clarence. Jones also has a lethal machine, ED 209 that fails at first, but is fixed after. Robocop learns that Clarence is working for Jones and tries arresting Jones, but has to get past ED 209 first. Lewis eventually learns that Robocop is her deceased partner, Murphy and helps him get Clarence and Jones. The late, O'Herlihy (Halloween III: Season of the Witch) plays the old man in charge of OCP. I've always liked this film, Weller & the cast are great as well as Basil Poledouris' score. This is an 80's classic I recommend." "As far as a cop would go sure a robot with the common sense and logical capacity of a human would be handy, especially given the assumed strength and durability of the robot bits. But in the world of superheroes or truly dangerous and formidable foes Robocop sorta just sucks. I mean really over the three films he caps around 25 bad guys and gets absolutely demolished and in need of major repair in every. Single. Film. His major 'skill' is the ability to shoot relatively straight and to deliberately ricochet bullets at certain angles. So trick shots is his superpower basically. Yet if you have the equivalent of an Atari 2600 or similar you could probably hack in and alter his programming so that he might target the weak and innocent, or his own colleagues. I'm pretty sure he'd short circuit if he passed a microwave, and I'd guess he'd be f*cked if he got tasered. All in all quite a sucky hero really. But all that said they ended up making three of these things. And here they are, so without further ado Once upon a time, in a world gone to sh*t Future Detroit is a mess, crime is rampant, poverty everywhere and the privately run police force either outmatched or as crooked as those it should be chasing. The most formidable bad guy out there is Clarence Bodicker, a ruthless killer who reigns supreme over a rag tag bunch or similarly slack-moraled minions. Unfortunately for Murphy (Peter Weller) his first day after being transferred to the most dangerous station in Detroit see him cross paths with Bodicker's bunch and turned into something resembling a rissole in front of his partner Lewis (Nancy Allen). The next day Murphy's still twitching corpse is reanimated and finds integrated into various metal parts that form the chassis of the guy on the poster: Robocop. Robocop is a crime fighting cyborg programmed to uphold the law and unleashed upon a city in dire need of serving and protecting. The early stages of his duty are  as Borat would say  'great success', but after a few days and a few bullets to the head Robo-Murphy starts experiencing glitches, flashbacks, memories things that a robotic being shouldn't have. After a few unfortunate occurrences the human police force turns against ol' Roby and call a strike which leads to even more chaos and disorder than a Sunday morning at the Charlie Sheen household. Can Robocop save the day and differentiate between Murphy and its Cyborg self? You'll have to watch to find out. Robocop hasn't aged well, but it does have a few noteworthy elements. There are frequent clever 'future' ads shown through the film that are filled with very black humour, and some other moments that show how the lust for new technology isn't always for the benefit of society. While exceedingly violent the on screen action features more splatter than gore, meaning although many die in a hail of blood and bullets it really isn't too realistic and upsetting. If anything the more guys that get mown down the more 'meh' it all becomes. The design of Robocop is actually very impressive and he gets to coin a few catchphrases of his own while upholding the law in his own carefully programmed way, even if in reality the question might be asked 'what use is a robot-cop that can still be taken down by gunfire anyway?\" Final Rating  6.5 / 10. Hardly an 80s action landmark when compared to Predator or Die Hard, Robocop was nonetheless a worthwhile film that has dated badly and been superseded by the ultra-violence that it satirised." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Paul Verhoven seems to be an intense guy. I would love to see him direct his version of a Nora Ephron-type romantic comedy. But until then, we need to satisfy ourselves with the world he has created, one of giant bugs and cyborgs and lesbian serial killers and hollow men and Kuatos bursting from a guy's chest, and three-breasted women, and \"Saved By The Bell\" cast member's grinding into Agent Cooper like they're having a fit. Verhoven is an extreme in a world of half measures. Here, he takes what should probably been a simple B movie about a killed cop being made into a half man/half cyborg law enforcement officer and cranks it up (I almost said \"Cranks it to 11\" but I think that has finally stopped being clever for writers to use). He takes the premise and adds a Jesus metaphor to it, and also films the violence so splatterly that the camera must have always had a plastic tarp on it. Peter Weller does wonders wearing a costume that looks like it hurt to wear (it did). He manages to take an unrealistic character and make him very human, so that we are shocked how involved we get in his dilemma of not being a dead man, but not being a live robot either. All Robocop knows is he needs revenge against the gang that (sorta kinda) killed him. Much gore and blood ensue. I have read that this is a satire ofwhat exactly I don't know. Corporate greed, I suppose. If anything, I think it satirizes the conventions of a Charles Bronsan action revenge thriller (while embracing the clichés necessary). I'm not sure Verhoven could even tell you.

Shearer pursued Clarence and the team into an abandoned ware house. Clarence managed to ambush officer shearer and than proceeded to empty his load all over shearers torso along with his fella comrades in crime before finally releasing his final load in shearers face. Clarence knew he did wrong and he was now on the run big time. Mean while doctors and nurses had managed to clean officer shearer up and give him a make over and shearer also managed to have his name and identity changed to spare he from the humiliation he suffered that frightful day. Shearer had now become Robo Cop a new masculine macho name to make him feel like a real man again. But he was now bitter and angry and was after Clarence. Clarence knew this and after a crime spree with rocket launchers and machine guns robot cop manged to finally have it out with Clarence one on one,man to man in a flour factory, obviously Clarence didn't come off to well in this fight, he got thrown through quite a lot of glass panes and was forced to grass up his own mate.

Any way Clarence skipped bail and manged to lure robot cop into a scrap yard, here they proceeded to fight it out to the death and unfortunately Clarence took a sneaky stab from robocop to the throat. Clarence died and so did a piece of my heart,the local bad boy done good was butchered by a cop in cold blood. Any way robocop went on to murder his boss by throwing him out the window and is now probably standing trial for double homicide.THE END. Bloody good film how this never won an Oscar for best script i will never know." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "One of the better films from the action packed 80's. Verhoeven's graphic and violent movie of a crime ridden, futuristic Detroit has our cyborg hero pitted against a ruthless crime boss who wants to control the city; and an even more ruthless corporation (OCP) which owns and runs the police department. The film is well paced and entertaining, and uses dark humour and irony to good effect. Definite highlight is the action sequence in the cocaine warehouse. Special effects are also impressive. Watch for ED 209. Still a fan of the unstoppable, I loved watching Robocop strut his stuff. Wednesday, May 20, 1992 - Video Verhoeven's violent, near future vision of Detroit works well as an action film even on return viewing. The action sequences are very well put together (the highlight), and special effects are convincing indeed. Mr. Verhoeven's graphic style, which spoilt \"Basic Instinct\", suits this film down to the ground. The movie's narrative keeps you interested, and if you like unstoppable cops, then this film is for you. Saturday, September 19, 1992 - Video" "Before I saw this movie, I saw at least one of the sequels and maybe both. Whatever I have seen, one detail stood out in my mind: the humanity and caring nature of 'Robocop', who was remembering his life as a human. So I figured I could enjoy this movie. Of course, it was too violent for my taste, but I did have several favorable impressions. In this movie, the cop whose brain was used for 'Robocop' kept the memories that made him 'human', though his past did not make a strong impression at first. ED-2000 was a pleasure to watch (except when its actions resulted in violence) because of the primitive but well-done animation, which was obviously animation. I didn't think I would like Kurtwood Smith as a genuinely bad person, but he was deliciously evil and a real treat to watch. His talent for comedy came through here. But I prefer it when he is just being cruel to teenagers who, deep down, he really cares about." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "You may be thinking how can this guy like robocop better than terminator.MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD well I first saw this movie when I was 7 and it was the most violent and most action filled movie I had ever seen.the film has everything action, comedy and even drama.my favourite scene is when ED-209 kills Kinney, It is funny and gruesome ( Only Paul Verhoeven and the monty python cast can do that IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE, SEE IT NOW!!!!!! 10/10" "Without doubt, one of the best 'boy' action movies of all time. The graphic violence and lame cliches make this movie (set in the 'near future') somewhat predictable, but the quality of the action puts it into an exclusive league. This movie doesn't have any pretentious views on the world, it just makes fun of everyone. If you enjoyed Die Hard and The Terminator, I suggest you watch this movie. If Remains of the Day is more your style - avoid. Best line (From the drunk at the Police Station): \"I'm what you call a repeat offender. I repeat, I will offend again.\" Best Concept: The commercials used to intro the news breaks - I want a copy of 'Nukem' for Christmas!" "Jorgie, what are you thinking? How is the Terminator a wannabe, yet it was released 3 years before? Wow. Anyway, this movie is pretty good, but all the sequels sucked. I'd certainly still take the Terminator over Robocop any day, but if you're not in the mood to watch Terminator, get T2:Judgement Day."

"I would have to say, RoboCop is the most violent movie of all-time. The violence of other Sci-Fi and Action films were no match for this one, the scene where Peter Weller's character Murphy gets killed slowly is the most unbearable scene for me. I could accept violent deaths like Impaling, Decapitation and other causes of death as long as it's quick and it's the bad guy who's dying. But there's nothing compared to this especially when I lately discovered in the internet that there was a symbolism of Christ's crucifixion in Murphy's death scene. And I would have nightmares on that death scene dreaming that it was me getting shot and killed slowly, anyway the plot is dark and has black humor on it. The movie is an instant classic becoming the most violent film ever made, so violent that there was one true story in my home country where a 9 year old boy was watching this film but his maid wants to watch a TV show which made the kid angry ending up shooting her. RoboCop 2 was a dud but RoboCop 3 did a good job finishing the trilogy despite making it a PG-13 rating (which I really did appreciate too) and Peter Weller's departure for the title role. In closing what I have shared to you in my movie review and the true story that I've told all I could say is...\"Stay out of trouble.\"" "People get killed so horribly in this movie that it's nothing short of hilarious. Except Murphy, of course. That scene is just sadistic and a little upsetting to be honest. It's even worse uncut, trust me. But when you have Red \"You Dumbass!\" Foreman as a brutal thug/killer, you know you can't go wrong. In fact, I'd put him up on a top twenty list of screen villains, he's that much of a bastard. This movie is violent. Did I mention that? Whether or not you've seen this, try to get your hands on the uncut version if you can. It's among the more brutal examples of cinema expression I can think of. The scene where ED-209 goes berserk and kills an OCP exec is extended and it's not like if he wasn't shot enough in the theatrical version. No, here they shoot him to the point that you start looking at your watch in disbelief. Verhoeven is one wacked-out Dutchman! I'm surprised he didn't play Goldmember come to think of it. Let the shoosting begin!!! This is a great comic-book style movie and I think fans of the genre know better than to let this one go by unnoticed. Rating **** out of *****." "This is a better film than you will remember. As a writer, I know how hard it is to end a really good piece, and as a film student, I'm coming to understand the pressures that a film producer is likely to place on talent. As such, I can forgive the film for my one beef, which is that the ending somewhat tempers the film. Robocop is an impressive, important piece of science-fiction satire, dealing with the definition of humanity on one level, but also, as the plot turns about, taking on deeper and more Shakespearian themes of ruthless self-advancement, dark times, mixed morality, and, in the form of Robocop's Prime Directives, absolute honor. (Those who would protest Verhoeven's level of violence I'd ask to attend an opera.) After a wonderful plot was set up, right up to the third act, however, a far too light and simple ending was presented. It seemed almost as if the film ran out of time and had to rush a wrap-up through production. In the process, Robocop and his lovely, mad world got short changed. Fortunately, it was not enough to kill a really great film. This is a true classic, and not to be missed." "One OF The Best Science Fiction Movies Ever.Non Stop Action And Gore.Peter Weller Plays Well As Robocop And Kurtwood Smith And Ronny Cox play well as the villains. The Story is Peter Weller Gets Bumped off by a gang of killers and is transformed into Robocop. watch out creeps your going to be done. Jack Foreman" "'Robocop' never seems to get much of the praise of other big budget (or even medium budget) sci-fi/action films of the 1980s and early 1990s. Terminator, Blade Runner, Videodrome, and the like are frequently raised as examples of both visual quality and politically grounded narratives. But why has Robocop generally ceded to the background? It may be less visually adept as some of its predecessors (and the stop-action animation may even have been nearing obsoleting), but the film itself appears to be a bleak allegory of America--one inundated with a habitually violent and consumerist culture, and forewarns of the privatization of public services as well as the unpleasant battle of Man and his increasingly sophisticated technological artifacts. The film takes place in Old Detroit, a run down city with a serious crime problem. So much so that the regular police force seems ill-equipped to manage it. And, this spread of uncontrollable violence appears to be an epidemic (listen to the lady who said she was going somewhere on vacation, but the place was in the middle of an invasion). Their desperation for a silver lining comes in the form of robotic cops that a technology company, seeking to introduce their designs into the police department of Old Detroit and eventually gain military contracts thereafter. But, within the company, two high level executive rivals compete with one another, although the design of Robocop obviously wins out over the Star Wars looking prop. So, throw your civil rights out the window, there's a new sheriff in town. But, Robocop of course has been programmed by man is susceptible to the control of the rivaling executives and that is to the benefit of one who is in cahoots with a notorious gang." "Pretty good yarn about a cop in the future who's left for dead by some bad guys. He's resurrected by technology and becomes Robocop, a mixture of technology and humanity. His one-time partner, played by Nancy Allen, eventually recognizes him (he has a rather distinctive jaw) and, after he's hurt rather badly again, she nurses him back to health. I found it pretty entertaining and I think Nancy Allen is incredibly cute. So I was probably predisposed to like this." "Considering it was 1987, there was a lot of stuff, most of it gory, that would have been censored in most other movies with similar scenes. You can often tell in other movies that they do things as to lower the rating like not showing certain things. NOT HERE. If they wanted to show you something, you saw it. That was what really made me like the movie compared to other movies this type." "In the near future, the city of Detroit is overrun by a corporation called \"OCP\" (Omni Consumer Products) whom also run the local police station. The city has too much crime and corruption going on especially cop-killers, the corporation decides to make a special program for the police with a new kind of special technology for them. Newcomer officer Alex J. Murphy (Peter Weller) with his partner Ann Lewis (Nancy Allen) pursue a vicious gang of cop-killing criminals led by Clerence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith), but during an attempted arrest Boddicker and his crew mutilates Murphy to pieces. Luckily the OCP is working on a special cybernetic cop program as they use Murphy's former dead corpse for their Frankenstein-esquire experiment that makes him into a technologically advanced cyborg with special bulletproof and bomb-proof metal and a need to protect the innocent and stop evil. He becomes a sensation towards the public, the media and even the other police officers but underneath that fancy armor memories of his past suddenly trigger especially of his execution as he seeks revenge on those that murdered him. OCP co-chairman Dick Jones (Ronny Cox) along with Boddicker join forces together as they come up with a plan to eliminate Robocop. A brutally violent, stylish and highly energized yet entertaining Sci-fi action epic that is Paul Verhoeven's masterpiece. This became the director's U.S. debut movie and is a perfect mix of action, sci-fi and dark comedy thrown into it with some social satire that has made this a critically acclaimed and very popular movie. The violence and gore especially the infamous death of Murphy is so over the top that it nearly got an X rating but was cut down to get an R rating into theaters, the film co-stars Miguel Ferrer and Daniel O'Herihy. The acting is quite good, the music score by Basil Poledouris is superb and the make-up effects and Robocop effects by Rob Bottin and Phil Tippet are out of this world, it's an unforgettable movie that is one of Sci-fi's greatest motion pictures.

"Good science-fiction films are hard to come by. Films set in a bleak future are not. And yet Robocop effectively combines those two sub-genres and ends up being what is quoted to be \"the best science-fiction film since Metropolis.\" Although I haven't seen Metropolis, I know that Robocop is not the greatest science-fiction film in the last 50 years. Merely, it is a mediocre film, with cliché characters, a confusing plot with generic evil corporate bosses with basic names...the list goes on and on. What saves Robocop is just that-Robocop. He's probably the coolest fictional character ever created (well, either him or Grimace from McDonald's). Either way, it's the pure cool factor of Robocop that puts the movie from mediocrity to something to be remembered. Police officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is brutally shot to death by thugs in a not-to-distant future Detroit, where a company's going to provide the police force with robots for cops. The prototype that's brought out screws up, so they decide to make Murphy into the title character. He's now Robocop, a cop that kicks ass and takes names, but has memories of his demise still lodged into his head. He decides to go out for revenge, as the company tries to kill him so they can put their robot on the market. As I said before, the action's just mediocre. There's some shooting and everything, but done generically. The best part isn't the action, thankfully. It's when there's stuff happening outside the action with Robocop. When he goes out to stop crime. He stops a rape by shooting a man in the genitals, which basically goes THROUGH the woman's dress. No human could do that, only the epitome of cool could: Robocop. And Weller does a great job as the stone-faced cop, with just the little bit of emotion. Nancy Allen is the token hard-assed female on the force, who acts like she's in an 80's movie, so I guess that's OK. The film as a whole is never boring-Paul Verhoeven keeps everything rolling for it's short-but-sweet runtime, and I liked all of the pre-Starship Troopers attacks on America-\"Get them before they get you!\" I also liked what Verhoeven did with portraying Robocop as a modern day Jesus-it worked effectively. So the movie works for the most part-any time where Robocop is on the screen. If you can get past the generic feel of the rest of the movie, and just watch for Robocop, you'll love it. My rating: 7/10 Rated R for strong violence and language." "In Detroit of the \"near future\" crime is getting out of hand and the police are being killed left and right. A corporation (OCP) is hired to develop machines that would replace police. Officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is viciously killed in the line of duty. He is brought back to life as Robocop--half machine and half man with no memory of his human life. But then he starts to remember and goes after the people who killed him. Director Paul Verhoeven's blockbuster hit of 1987 isn't really all that good. It does have good things about it--there's some very funny but pitch black humor; parodies of TV commercials and news; great stop motion animation; plenty of blood and violence and LOTS of shootouts. That's the main problem--this movie is TOO loud and seems more interested in violence than in a coherent plot (there are loopholes galore). There has to be at least 5 huge gunfights here which just go on forever. Also the violence gets far too graphic--Weller's torture and killing just goes way overboard. The acting doesn't matter too much--violence is all this movie has to offer. Weller is OK, Allen is terrible but Ronny Cox and Kurtwood Smith have a lot of fun in their roles. A lot of people like this for the virtual nonstop action and violence but it tired me down after a while and the one interesting aspect of the plot (Murphy remembering his life as a human) isn't given enough time to really develop. Also the plot loopholes get increasingly noticeable after a while...for instance, how did Cox get that directive #4 installed in Robocop's system when he had nothing to do with its creation? It's mentioned that OCP is under some corporation--what corporation? Still, if you're looking for mindless blood, violence and destruction this IS your movie. Great ending too. I give it a 7. Also take a VERY close look at the statement after the closing credits--there's a funny little line snuck in there."

"*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Robocop is an amazing movie! Alex J. Murphy/Robocop(Peter Weller) is killed by notorious criminals and he is later reconstructed as Robocop. The movie is extremely gory and is very well made. It has a great story for an action movie. It is cool to see Robocop slowly regain some of his humanity and memories which leads to him taking revenge. The music score is fantastic and really feels right for the movie. The look of Robocop is very original. The special effect hold up very well. It also has some of the best movie lines ever. Robocop is an action movie hero that is one of a kind. Robocop is a movie that deserves to be called a classic. It's over the top, well made, and a perfect movie." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Robocop is one of those films where you have to have the right mindset when watching it, if you're expecting this to be an amazing movie then you'll be surely disappointed but if you're expecting fun, well then it delivers. Robocop tells the story of Alex Murphy who's a cop, in the first twenty or so minutes of the movie he gets shot and killed, in what is a pretty violent death. Eventually Alex get's reborn again but not as a human but instead as a cyborg to help keep crime off the city streets, this is basically the whole plot to the movie. It's a movie that has a simple plot with little to no character development but yet you can't help but love it. As I said earlier the story in the film is simple, but that doesn't mean its bad. Robocop may not have a good story but it does work for what it is, Robocop mainly skips on the story though and just delivers action and blood which for a movie like this, I'm not going to complain. Robocop does get cheesy at times but that's what makes this fun, it has a lot of one liners and quotable lines. The acting in the film is pretty solid, I can't really complain about them seeing how the movie is from the 80's and some of the action is expected to come off as cheesy. All the actors make best with what they have to work with. I think Robocop is just one of those movies you should have fun with and not try picking apart, it does get cheesy at times but it's a movie from the 80's so its almost expected. If you want a movie that's fun, has lots of blood, and explosions then you'll enjoy this." "I just got done watching Robocop and i have to admit it kept me interested the whole time. The blood splattering in this movie was top notch. Robocop (Murphy) seems to me to be a more friendly terminator and without an Austrian accent. I wouldn't say this movie is for everyone. I have always enjoyed an old school action movie so its not a far stretch for me to be entertained by this movie. I will definitely be watching this again.No doubt in my mind! But just for people with weak stomachs...if your not ready for exploding body parts then stay away from my boy Robocop! In this day and age Detroit needs robocop to clean up the streets. Sincerely, Beast from the southeast" "I saw Robocop when it was theatrically released in 1997 (I was then 20 years old), and while I loved it, I was as conflicted about it then as I am now. Which is to say that I was very, very conflicted. Robocop is a reprehensible piece of work and it's also one of my favorite movies. The tension between loathing and adoration is probably what makes it memorable to me, more than the film's admittedly striking visual and intellectual content. Basically, Robocop is an ultra-vicious splatter movie dressed up as a dystopian science-fiction satire. It presents a relentlessly bleak, thuggish and superficial future world where capital controls society to such an extent as to resemble a form of economic fascism. The plot centers on the struggle between what remains of Murphy, a murdered police officer, part of whose brain has been used as material in the construction of the titular law-enforcement robot, and OCP, the giant, shadowy mega-corporation that has privatized the police department. Paul Verhoeven (The 4th Man, Starship Troopers) directs from a script by Michael Miner and Edward Neumeier (Starship Troopers) with his customary technical skill and taste for brutally black comedy. In many ways Robobop is Verhoeven's ultimate statement on the toxic wasteland of American culture, his primary theme since abandoning his native Netherlands. He presents the viewer with a vision of a violent, stupid, media-saturated society, and berates viewers for their complicity with that society. This would not be so terribly unique a position take, but for one brilliant stroke on Verhoeven's part: he makes movies that present themselves, too, as extensions of the society he criticizes. Which is to say that all of his American movies have been explicitly `American movies' - autocritical devices that function as examples of that on which they purport to comment. They are cold, stupid, brutal affairs that express nothing so clearly as their loathing for any audience that might enjoy them. At the same time, they subtly or explicitly subvert their superficial grotesquerie by commenting on the social milieu in which they take place. Thus both Robocop and Starship Troopers not only resemble bad American television shows, they explicitly present themselves as bad American television shows, complete with advertisements and vacuous `news briefs.' Robocop is especially ruthless with regard to its audience, subjecting viewers to a dizzying, non-stop assault of violent spectacle. It veers back and forth between amusingly arch comic-book violence and nauseatingly graphic brutality, pulling the audience in with the comfortable spectacle of well-executed action movie derring-do, and then punishing viewers for enjoying it by subjecting them to incredibly drawn-out and grisly scenes of torture and mutilation. On one level, Robocop obviously wants to comment on and criticize the senseless, inconsequential brutality of American action cinema, but to that end it luxuriates in it's critic's license by hyperextending it's own representations of violence to previously unimaginable extremes. Sitting through Robocop for the first time (especially, I imagine, in it's new, vastly bloodier \"director's cut\" edition) is a profoundly disturbing and desensitizing experience. This is not necessarily a problem. Much of the 20th century's greatest art is profoundly disturbing, and Robocop never allows its violence to function as simpleminded \"thrills\". It humanizes the violence it seems to celebrate, reminding the audience at every turn that pain and terror are integrally linked to \"action.\" To complicate matters, however, it intentionally undercuts it's own critique, constantly letting the audience off the hook by supplying a horrific joke or a swashbuckling uplift to deflate our revulsion when the horror becomes too much to bear. Robocop wants to have it's cake and eat it too, criticizing the conventions of American action movies as an emblem of the vacant blackness at the center of the American soul, but also reveling in the undeniable joys of the action movie format for the sake of turning a buck at the box office. This is certainly a valid approach, and Verhoeven may be congratulated for eschewing a puritan didacticism in his critique. But as with Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers, one is left with the suspicion that for all the intellectual dazzle and political posturing, there is something horribly manipulative and heartless about the sensibility at work behind the film. That the movie is not fundamentally the autocritical device it purports to be, but merely a nihilistic bellow of rage and disgust, a self-important tirade against an audience for which the filmmaker feels nothing but contempt. Even worse, I worry that deep down Robocop (like NBK) is nothing but cynical moneymaking ploy, dressed up in the sheep's clothing of subversive intent to blunt the edge of critical assault. You can't really bring yourself to fault Robocop for it's cynicism, ugliness, and cruelty, after all, because it pretends to be merely holding a mirror up to our American soul. And who could fault so noble an intent, even as we watch Verhoeven walk away, laughing, hand in hand with Joe Eszterhas (author of Verhoeven's Basic Instinct and Showgirls) and great big bag of nice, green money." "This movie isn't exactly the most unique of it's kind, although it does have some original aspects. However, Robocop does entertain on many different levels. Firstly, the action in this movie is very enjoyable and is nothing too over-the-top, although some people may argue me on that, and yes is does push censors for an R-rated, non horror movie to be this gruesome at times. The story in this movie is also something more than you're classic shoot-em' up cops and robbers movie, it adds an element of philosophy in the ideas of humanity and poses the question of where does one draw the line between robot and human? Not only is this a question posed, but it is a reoccurring issue throughout. Another angle this movie takes on is the idea of man's desire for control over man by a newer means; technology. Extending from this is the idea of how much control man has over machine (an element we've seen in so many movies before, and after) and can a machine actually perform the functions of a human being with the obvious lack of emotionable ability. Throw in some quality acting, great directing, a cool cyborg, another cool robot with big guns, more big guns and a wickedly evil Red Foreman and you've got a movie that shimmers the light of hope in a dismal future and a Hollywood classic." "I first saw this movie years ago and didn't remember it too well so I saw it again recently and I thought the movie was really horrid. Most of the violence to me is very bad. Very was little of it was necasasary. The guy getting hit by the car after being in a bunch of toxic chemicals had no point except to show something gross. The idea of this movie is nice and shows a great view of the world in the future. Otherwise I think this movie is overrated. 3/10" "ROBOCOP (1987) ***1/2 Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, Ronny Cox, Kurtwood Smith, Dan O' Herlihy. Sci-fi actioner from director Paul Verhoeven paints a nifty portrait of the future set for a world of violence, corporate take overs and lastly a gang of murderous thugs who kill a Detroit policeman and used as the force's special projects group pet project of assembling a law enforcement cyborg (Weller in a humdinger of a role) to serve and protect the public good. Sly satire with a dash of comic book non-chalant gore makes a diverting entertaining flick. Best line: after baddie Smith disables human-for-the-moment Weller the fallen officer retorts \"Buddy... I think you're slime!\"" "An entertaining movie with plenty of action and gratuitous breasts (bar scene) but something interesting caught my attention: A possible low key slam at Pontiac by Ford via the writers? Here is my logic: The OCP officers drove futuristic Ford Taurus police cars, correct? Normally car manufacturers provide cars to movie makers for advertising purposes, though I didn't see an acknowledgment in the credits. Thus the potential for sponsor influence. I know, without the acknowledgment it is a bit of a stretch, but bear with me. There were numerous references to the \"6000SUX\" gas guzzling car, including the cute commercial by the CHIODO Bros. What relevance is this? The number 6000. Robocop was released in 1987. The Ford Taurus hit the streets in 1986 and it's main competitor was Pontiac's \"6000.\" 6000 SUX... 6000 sucks? Subliminal suggestion? Are the writers that clever? Food for thought, but funny if true..." "I don't mind violence...but the Robocop Director's Cut is mind boggling. Murphy's death is violent enough in the released version. In the X, it is very disturbing. It made me want to jump into the screen and punish those guys in the most horrific ways just to let them know how FUBAR they really were. For die-hard Robo fans, do not waste the $35-$40 it costs just to be grossed out. The R-rated version is fine just the way it is. It is also so bad, that after Kurtwood Smith and Ray Wise (Clarence and Leon) saw the screening, they said that they pleaded with Paul Verhoeven to tone it down since they didn't want to be forever linked as the psycho killers in Robocop. It took awhile; but luckily for their career sakes they have gone on to do other stand-out performances that sometimes for the regular film-TV viewer, they don't automatically associate them as the former." "You know I was only 2 years old when this movie was released and my parents said they actually let me watch it when I was 4 years old when it was released? My sister always teased them about how they wouldn't let me watch other movies with little violence or just a little nudity, but they'd let me watch Robocop? Well, they took it to heart, I never saw Robocop again, figuring now that I'm 21, maybe I have a right to see it on my own and may I say that this was a true action flick and a definite cliché of all action movies of the 80's, gotta love them. Murphy is a cop, but when he goes to bust a drug and weapon scandal going on, he gets brutally shot that automatically kills him, but OCP, the police organization he works for have been looking for a cop that doesn't rest or can be killed while being on the job, they take Murphy's body and turn him into Robocop! A machine that acts like a cop and performs the duties of one, but he starts to go haywire when he has flashbacks of Murphy's memories and there may be a traitor in the police force! While Robocop is one of the most unrealistic movies you will ever see in your life, it was all in good fun. I have to say that I have never heard a more useless way of the F Word like I did in Robocop, but that was so funny! Not to mention I loved the death out the window! It's not a true 80's action flick without a death out the window. If you are looking for a movie to take seriously, don't watch it, but for good fun, just please get the popcorn and have a good time! 7/10" "Add another review" "Find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your Watchlist and rate your favorite movies and TV shows on your phone or tablet!")("Movies, TV & Showtimes" "Celebs, Events & Photos" "News & Community" "Watchlist" "" "Find industry contacts & talent representation" "Manage your photos, credits, & more" "Showcase yourself on IMDb & Amazon" "Sign in with Facebook Other Sign in options" "Own the rights?" "It's a shame that this movie wasn't done better because there's a lot of potential because the story is great. But unfortunately this movie was done in the 1980's which means you're stuck with cheesy, over-the-top acting, mediocre effects (though I'm sure they were at least typical when the film was made), and the same crappy directing that plagued so many films in the era. I think there's a lot of potential to the story and the human element and internal conflict of the RoboCop/Murphy character but the film largely skims right past most of that focusing more on needless side clips of a setting that was never established or non-critical villains. I'm interested to see the reboot version and hoping they go the direction so many other films in this generation of action movies have gone... dark, realistic, and gritty. If you gave this concept to Christopher Nolan, you'd have an amazing movie. Hopefully the reboot can be everything the original wasn't. Now it sounds like I'm being really hard on the movie and yet I gave it a 7/10 so what gives? Well, it was still a good movie, even with all the minor negatives, because the story has so much potential and even with the poor execution it manages to pull you in." "\"RoboCop\" has not aged gracefully. The action sequences seem stagey and flat in this post-\"Matrix\" age, and the clay animated ED209 now looks more like a \"Wallace & Gromit\" villain than a fearsome metallic menace. The violence is indulgent and over-the-top, the women all have silly '80s hair, and the main villain is the Dad from \"That '70s Show.\" The whiskers on this movie are about a mile long. Aside from that, though, it's pretty good. Ronny Cox is an engaging bad guy, often picking up the slack when the rest of the movie is falling down around him, and his final defeat is one of the cleverest gimmicks I've ever seen in a movie. The social satire is entertaining, but ultimately quite predictable; don't all sci-fi movies predict that marketing will become infinitely more obnoxious in the future? I have mixed praise for Robocop himself; he's got personality and he's easy to root for, but why is Murphy so much cooler as a cyborg than as a human? He had to die to acquire a shred of charisma! At the end of the day, this is dated but fun - and it's nowhere near a masterpiece. The Criterion Collection must've released this movie on an off day, when they couldn't get the rights to something better." "I will admit I would have probably given this film a couple more stars back in the day. It was popular because it was different. A new, somewhat original concept is always embraced excitedly. But our attention to detail and critical eyes have evolved since the eighties. There's no chance this movie could survive with such high ratings if it had been a new release in this generation of film. Even if it'd been lavishly souped with our great special effects of the day. The utter absurdity that was the violence in this film is laughable. People shot so heavily and so continuously and still they live? Even if they die, they die so dramatically it's ridiculous. I finally had to completely suspend all belief to finish this film, and simply embrace it's whole-hearted science-fictional ways. 'Okay, so this is a world where people don't die like real people do. Cool. There are robots running around. I can handle it.' Still, after making such an adjustment, it failed, sadly, to make the movie good. They spent all their time developing the effects and less time with the story and characters. That's not to say they did NO work. I liked the female lead. She was cool. But there wasn't enough of her. Robo was cool, too. But I could have used a little more of developing the male lead and a little less of the pointless time spent developing the robot. The rest of this fantasy world was just hopped up on a whole lot of crazy and I couldn't care one hill of beans about how it turned out. I knew how it was going to end, but the process of getting me there left me seriously wanting. I gave it three stars because I thoroughly enjoyed seeing my surly 'That '70s Show' father, Kurtwood Smith, playing a bad guy." "The first movie of the popular \"RoboCop\" series is considered to be the best of them and a masterpiece of science fiction. While it is really original and has strong message, it is too gory (and I say this being a horror-fan), chaotic and unpleasant to watch. The main character, RoboCop is very interesting and the villain is really ghastly and memorable, but the bad robot looks very stupid and the film is full with scenes of sadistic violence, which made it tough to watch. Unlike the sequels, the first RoboCop is considered to be a \"serious scifi\", but it's neither good nor as enjoyable as the best movie in the cyborg genre - The Terminator." "i was just wondering if RoboCop ever felt sexual longing for women. anyone care to respond? if there is a part where he displays (i'll even allow references from the less-enjoyable sequels) such a characteristic, tell me where it is, because i certainly missed it. another funny thing i noticed is that the actor who plays Joe Cox is named Jesse Goins. add an 'r' after the 'G' and what does it spell? i thought that was humorous." "A surprisingly nasty and off-putting action film from 1987. \"RoboCop\" is set in a near future where corporations are creating robotic sentinels to help fight rampant crime. One such creation haywires and runs amok. Enter RoboCop, created when a police officer (Peter Weller) is killed in the line of duty and resurrected as a part human/part robotic commando. An intelligent screenplay would have used this set up to explore some moral questions about man vs. machine, or nature vs. mechanization. At the very least it would have explored the psyche of Weller's character a bit more, examining the act of killing from the point of view of someone who's neither completely human nor completely mechanical. But this isn't an intelligent film, so it opts instead to wallow in sadistic and graphic violence. By the end of the film, whole scenes are being set up for the sole purpose of seeing people be flayed, dismembered, immersed in toxic waste and killed in other splatter-porn variations. It's a film that invites you to enjoy it as a bit of escapism and then makes it difficult to have much fun with it. Stephen Flick and John Pospicil received a special achievement Academy Award for their Sound Effects Editing, and the film received two competitive nominations that it did not win: Best Film Editing (Frank J. Urioste) and Best Sound (Michael J. Kohut, Carlos de Larios, Aaron Rochin and Robert Wald). Grade: C-" "I would recomend this movie to people but not all.The reason this movie isn't great is it is very very gory.It also has a lot of drug use and other stuff.But other then those things it is a good action film.I would give this a 6.5 out of ten and recomend it to action fans but be warned it is a gory film." "I guess I'm going to be the outcast here and say this movie was a major disappointment in just about every category. I watched the Criterion version, OOP and therefore expensive, and simply don't get it. What qualifies this to be nominated for Oscars? If this one claims Oscars, then there is simply no award that would do justice to 'The Terminator'. OK, let me not compare this to any other movie. How does it weigh on its own? The dialogue - agonizingly flaky and juvenile. The FX - blasé. The storyline - predictable to the end. The acting - remarkably unremarkable. To its credit, there were about 5 minutes of film that stood apart from the rest. The 'robot demo' at the executive meeting, and Murphy's bloody demise. The savagery in both cases was well captured and made a point. Everything else was script-out-of-a-can, acting-out-of-a-can, plot-out-of-a-can, etc. For e.g., how does Robocop prove its battle-worthiness on the mean streets? By foiling a convenience store holdup and a rape. These 2 scenes were so tired and clichéd - they're standard procedure in just about every cop and robber movie ever made. There's a lot of discussion and appreciation in these forums about the 'humanity' of Robocop. OK, so he forgets his folks, but figures out their/his address from a computer and wanders through his abandoned old house, and is programmatically unable to enforce the law on his creators. I'm sorry, but for me, that's hardly a portrait in humanity. C'mon folks, if you look real hard for something, you'll likely wind up imagining its there. If it had the least shred of humanity, for example, it wouldn't go letting loose its guns for target practice when its partner (who rescued it, btw) is sleeping just a few feet away, dog-tired. The ending was completely predictable and unworthy of any subsequent contemplation. Its hard to not compare this unworthy conclusion to a real one-of-a-kind classic - The Terminator. The conclusion there was nothing but humanity, as best a machine could manifest. It was a conclusion that made me reflect, and feel, and imagine, long after the movie was over. In closing - I am not saying that this was a lousy movie - For it's time (1987) it was OK. I am saying that this is a vastly over-hyped movie that simply does not do justice to the accolades it has gathered. It is as good a movie as Tango and Cash, or Black Rain, or Dirty Harry. There is much better scifi out there - like the Alien series, The Terminator, The Matrix, Donnie Darko, etc., and what the heck - even Disney's Tron. That Criterion picked this to represent a high point of scifi cinematic accomplishment - is simply unfathomable. This gesture is not just a matter of conferring unwarranted and unworthy credit, it is additionally an affront to the real giants of scifi that have carved their names forever in cinema, our hearts, and our consciousness." "When I first saw this almost 20 years ago, I thought it was one of the most violent movies I'd ever seen. It may still be ranked as such, despite 20 more years of violent films. Much of it, at least in the first half of the film, is entertaining but it gets just too carried away with cartoon-like villains and overdone violence. I think what bothered me was that it looked like a film geared to attract kids, even with the R rating and millions of kids did indeed watch this. The villains are so outlandishly bad you almost have to laugh. Ronny Cox has to be one of the best actors and being someone the audience hates and Daniel O'Herlily isn't far behind in that category. Like many other, I like a good crime/science fiction film but this was just too nasty, too hard-edged and needlessly profane. What the movie needs is more humor in place of all the overdone shooting and profanity. It would have made it much better." "Sorry to say that RoboCop just didn't do it for me. If they were trying to be over the top and ridiculous, they failed. The film was kind of slow and to be completely honest, boring. It wasn't too silly, although the humor seemed kind of...blunt. The acting is fine, although some characters only succeed in being annoying. The effects are fine for the 80s, but the action is not very entertaining. I was just underwhelmed. I know that \"The Terminator\" is a very different sort of film, but as far as Cyborgs go, the movie and the character Terminator are a hell of a lot cooler and better. Anyway, enough of my ranting. Maybe I missed something, since many seem to like this film a lot. I personally didn't. 3/10, I would avoid."

"*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "From director Paul Verhoeven (Total Recall, Basic Instinct, Starship Troopers), I remember watching this film a few times when I was younger, but I could only remember certain moments, so in my older days I had to see it again. Basically in the not too distant future in Detroit, the city is ridden with crime, and the police department have been bought out by Omni Consumer Products (OCP), so the staff are going on strike. While Officer Alex J. Murphy (Peter Weller) has been transferred from Metro South to the West and partnered with Officer Anne Lewis (Carrie's Nancy Allen) the large corporate company taking over, run by senior president Dick Jones (Total Recall's Ronny Cox), are trying to find new ways to lower crime rate, and they have developed new robot ED-209 that goes wrong before it can even go into action. While Murphy and Lewis are trying to track down a gang of criminals, led by Clarence J. Boddicker (Dead Poets Society's Kurtwood Smith), the group beat up and shoot Murphy dead. One of the OCP employees makes another law enforcement robot to rival with Jones, with Murphy's corpse he transforms him into and creates RoboCop, a crime fighting machine with three prime directives: serve the public trust, protect the innocent, and uphold the law. For a good amount of time RoboCop proves himself as a worthy force for good and a great machine to clean up crime, with his gun skills, his ability to avoid injury, and his unrelenting attitude, but having the brain Murphy still inside him he is having flashes from his former life as a human. He is seeing flashes from when he was killed, more so after an encounter with one of the criminals, and flashes also include his life with his family, but with what is coming back to him he is finding a way to catch the gang and possibly have the chance to take revenge. Obviously Boddicker realises he is wanted by RoboCop, and Lewis recognised that it was Murphy inside the body of the robotic cop, and when he tries to kill the one bossing the gang, Jones, he discovers a fourth directive he was unaware of, that he cannot arrest or harm people who work at OCP. After a damaging encounter with the villain of the piece Murphy has pretty much completely remembered who he is, and with Lewis they hide out in a place the criminals will be gathering, taking of his mask, and ultimately getting his vengeance by killing them, and especially Boddicker. In the end RoboCop returns to OCP to prove that Jones is a criminal, and it is only after he is \"fired\" by the villain's higher in the company that RoboCop can kill Jones, and he walks away assuring the company he will surely carry on fighting crime. Also starring Miguel Ferrer as Bob Morton, Daniel 'Dan' O'Herlihy as The Old Man, Robert DoQui as Sergeant Warren Reed, Ray Wise as Leon C. Nash, Felton Perry as Johnson and Paul McCrane as Emil M. Antonowsky. The acting is good for all the parts, especially of course the leading star creating a magnificent cyborg police officer with mime like characteristics, the film is full of interesting ideas of how to create a \"perfect\" world, little pointers about the power of promotion and advertising, and niggles on social issues, and of course the sometimes comic violence and special effects really make this a fantastic satirical science-fiction action thriller. It won the Oscar for the Special Achievement Award for sound effects editing, and it was nominated for Best Film Editing and Best Sound, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Make Up Artist and Best Special Effects. Very good!" "'RoboCop' represents a low point in '80s sci-fi cinema. The acting is laughable, the plot redundant, and the dialogue stale. I suppose the film was intended to be brain candy, but its sheer unpleasantness causes it to fail even in this respect. The fun factor is further reduced by the movie's almost unbearably annoying villains who, for whatever reason, find it necessary to giggle with girlish glee whenever they kill or threaten someone. A stupid, pointlessly violent, and thoroughly unenjoyable movie. If you're looking for an enjoyable cyborg flick, this ain't it. Try 'The Terminator' or 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day' instead." "Leaving aside the sophomoric \"satire\" that seems for some unfathomable reason to have impressed far too many people, ROBOCOP is just a big, dumb, overblown action flick. This would have been a perfect vehicle for Steven Seagal (who pretty much acts like a robot anyway) if it had been made a year or two later. On the other hand, my taste and that of the American public do not exactly run parallel, thank God. Statistically speaking, given that everyone else seems to absolutely *love* this piece of garbage, you probably will too. So watch it, if you're impressed by red-colored Karo syrup and exploding stuff. But if you happen to notice that it's continually insulting your intelligence: remember, I'm the one who warned you." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "I saw \"Robocop\" on TV for the first time in 1990,and I actually enjoyed it even tho I was just a teenager.I liked the action and the violence,and Robocop himself looked cooler than everything...so what's not to like about this sci-fi action?First of all,the Verhoeven touch:the Dutch director loves the extreme violence and Robocop doesn't make exception..I actually have no problem with violence in movies,it could be funny as hell and also a sign of style.John Woo in his best Chinese days directed some of the best action movies I've ever seen,and they all had oceans of blood in em.But Verhoeven is different,his representation of violence is pure splatter and gratuitous.You can almost see the smile of his face when he represents the ultra-violent Murphy's execution by Clarence and his men.And then we see brains splattered,eyes ripped off,a guy obliterated by a malfunctioning prototype and so on.So this is the first problem,the over the top,gratuitous violence. The second problem is the crappy stop motion.I don't know why they used a horribly animated ED-209 instead of a real-size thing,but the scenes in which we see it,it looks hilarious. Third thing:not so much and not so good action.Don't get me wrong,Verhoeven is capable of filming some good action-Total Recall over all-,but this movie needed more and better scenes because it has such a cool character. Peter Weller does a good job although we mostly see him with his iron mask on,but it must have been a pain to wear that suit.Good supporting characters and a always great Kurtwood Smith who portrays the ruthless crime lord Clarence Butticker-so brave that he thinks he could go hand to hand with Robocop,and obviously fails with one eye less.The soundtrack is great,nothing to say about it. Last word:Robocop is a good movie,it has a good screenplay and it's entertaining,but leaves a lot to be desired.Cut off the flick all the things I mentioned above and you will have a great action sci-fi drama.If only they gave it to a different director....." "OK, I'm not a fan. But undoubtedly this movie had startling success; which led to a second part, a third part, and a fourth TV one, not to mention a TV series and another TV series but animated! So, why is that ? RoboCop (1987) is original when it comes to accumulate that load of drastic and loud live cartoon action, and in a big production too. Its title character was one of the first icy rigid heroes (as a machine, not like Arnie from the same era) who you love to combine with; to immerse in his violence, live the solidity, and forget all the feelings which make you too weak, fall in love, and have that human yet cruel wounds. It's a perfect way to enjoy the illusion of owning a super distractive ability, blowing up your annoying foes, and serving the society in the same time. So RoboCop, as a movie or a character, managed in the late 1980s to get a special place in the pop-culture and be a noticeable indicator in terms of the direct connection between the violence of reality and the violence of art, whereas the first comes always first, and art is naturally the mirror. Now let me elaborate on why this successful hero and movie aren't successful for me. First off, that literally metallic hero. They gave us a Ropo-Dirty Harry or his inbred development in the sci-fi genre after 15 years of its first appearance. Nevertheless, Inspector Harry is more human and less ridiculous (and you can say that again if replaced Dirty Harry with Darth Vader !). In short, with the way he speaks and moves, Robocop is too silly he's laughable ! As for the movie, I believe that its success had a lot to do with its violence, and the exaggerated representation of it on screen; by the camera's angles, the rough editing, the crack-brained special effects and the very profuse explosions ! This movie loyally imitated the foolish violence of the video games, with doubling it many times. To some extent, RoboCop (1987) did for the action movies what Madonna did for the pop singing; since both of them crowded the materialistically attractive elements; the harsh violence in the action blockbusters, and the sexiness in the modern singing and dancing; to shake up the pop culture, and  yes  win more money, rephrasing the rule from \"Sex Sells\" to \"Abundant Violence and Sex Abundantly Sell\" ! While it pretends to be satirical, the movie is so flat and hollow. Don't wait for a respectful satire about violent toys, inane media, or rotten authority; whether governments or companies. Because any social or political commentary, rather any serious concept; was exterminated by the heavy violence. In fact, the sole substance this movie has is seducing the audience and seizing their money by hectic and bloody fights ! Let alone, how this so-called satire was presented through comic touches; as TV news or commercials (about cheap violent toys !), with repeating them, in rhythmical manner, till the end of the movie.. the very movie which confirmed all the time that it's a real cheap violent toy in itself, having no difference except for its too much violence, extravagance and pretension ! Over and above, that insufferably disturbing spirit all the time. And it doesn't come from the cold mechanical cadence of the title's character only, but from the character of the director as well. He confessed, in a documentary about this movie, that in 1987 he didn't know any English; therefore he handled the work, so everybody, with great nervousness and unbroken outburst, and it's obvious how this infected the crew and the movie. Hence, it's easy to understand the secret of all the hysterical atmosphere and the burning pace.. It's Mr. Paul Verhoeven ladies and gentlemen ! Objectively speaking, RopoCop is some icon in the history of the American culture, which tells you a lot about the Americans themselves in one era. Plus it did leave an effect on the next era (Judge Dredd for little instance). Though, subjectively speaking, RopoCop is one heck of a stupid odious hero, all of what he does is goofy and ludicrous, this movie is sickening delirious nightmare, and whenever I hear its last line \"Call Me Murphy\" I instantly replay \"Sorry, I Call You Jerk\" !" "Boy is this film rubbish. If you want a robots film you will not find one that is worse.It's just a piece of rubbish on the ground. The story is so dumb and it goes on forever before it ends. It's a story about a cop who is shot all over the place but still doesn't die, and then he's turned into a robot. See what I mean? This is such a rubbish story. He goes after the man who killed him and tries to kill him back. This will make you feel so miserable, like coming home to find your house burgled. All the actors look weird and they are too old. The cops in the movie look more like salesmen. The special effects are rubbish which means that when they happen in the movie it makes you point and laugh at how rubbish they are. If they had made more effort to make them look better the film would have been better." "this is what i call unrealistic film. and i hate unrealistic films. behavior of people is unrealistic. it's not bad because of the story, which i like, and i think is possible. if you're kid then this film is probably good because you dont notice lack of realism yet. filmmakers think because science fiction is not real, then they can make also all other stuff in film non-realistic. this is problem with bad science fiction films. good science fiction films are realistic, like Alien and James Cameron films. realism in Alien is for example this: when man with beard goes with flame gun to chase alien. then when he is there he says: \"I don't think this is good idea. I want to get out of here.\" This is really how human psychology works. you can't know how you will feel in certain situation until you are there. 1/10" "Add another review" "Find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your Watchlist and rate your favorite movies and TV shows on your phone or tablet!")("Movies, TV & Showtimes" "Celebs, Events & Photos" "News & Community" "Watchlist" "" "Find industry contacts & talent representation" "Manage your photos, credits, & more" "Showcase yourself on IMDb & Amazon" "Sign in with Facebook Other Sign in options" "Own the rights?" "It's a shame that this movie is usually snubbed by shoving it into the \"action\" category. Sure, there are lot of legendary action sequences to be found, but RoboCop is a LOT more than that. Next time when you watch it, try to shift your focus from the cyborgs, explosions and gore towards the writing. From the main theme of criticizing the modern money driven society (a topic still relevant today, and will most likely be so in the future as well) all the way to the smallest bits of dialogue, the writing is nothing short of outstanding. RoboCop is simply the most intelligent \"action\" film to come out of Hollywood, ever. Unfortunately, the cleverness is hidden \"between the lines\" of comic book action. No wonder so many people fail to see this film for what it really is. Amazing cinematography, solid performances (especially from Kurtwood Smith and Miguel Ferrer), memorable musical score.. The list is endless. Granted, the stop motion effects of ED-209 look quite old today, but you have to remember we're talking about a movie made in 1987. RoboCop has its faults, like the rather embarrassing toxic waste scene, but they are easily forgiven compared to all the good things. You must be thinking \"What is this guy on? It's just a dumb little action flick about a cyborg!\" .. Relax, take a deep breath and watch it again. I like obscure art films as much as the next guy, but I'm not going to dismiss such greatness just because it comes wrapped in cartoon violence. I'm not saying RoboCop is art, the best movie ever made or the most important film of the year/decade/millennium. But it definitely deserves to be regarded higher. My only question is: How could Verhoeven succeed so well with this movie, and fail miserably in ALL other Hollywood titles he has worked on?" "Robocop is an unbelieveable experience. I haven't watched the film since 1988 and the other day I recieved it on DVD. So I eagerly popped it in the player and BOOM!!! The only way I can describe Robocop is ultraviolence. The film is so over the top and out of control. The film speaks of a future where big companies will run the governmental defense. Those times are upon us more and more everyday. Paul Verhoeven has made one of the most important science fiction films ever made and it's a brillant piece of cinema." "Paul Verhoeven's career in recent years has been wildly uneven, but back in the 1980s he rocked! His movies 'Spetters', 'The Fourth Man' and 'Flesh & Blood' are all brilliant and worth tracking down. His next movie, his first Hollywood one, could have been a complete disaster. Verhoeven initially passed on it without reading the script and wasn't experienced in working with special effects or a fan of science fiction. Thankfully his wife insisted he make the picture and the end result was a triumph. Apparently this was a very tough shoot for all concerned but the bottom line is what is on screen, and it really works. Few movies if any have managed to juggle SF, action and grim satire in such an entertaining and original fashion. Verhoeven was blessed with an excellent script, a well chosen bunch of actors, and a great behind the scenes team, and added to his own vision 'RoboCop' turned out to be one of the best movies of the 1980s, whatever the genre. Peter Weller ('Buckaroo Banzai') pulls off a difficult job - making the audience care about a guy in a monster suit. Probably the best performance of its kind since Boris Karloff in James Whale's 'Frankenstein' back in the 1930s. Nancy Allen ('Dressed To Kill'), Kurtwood Smith ('12.01 PM'), Ronny Cox ('Deliverance'), Miguel Ferrer ('Twin Peaks'), and the rest of the supporting cast are all first rate, and everything about this movie is perfect. Verhoeven stumbled with his next movie 'Total Recall', and apart from 'Starship Troopers' has pretty much failed to fulfill his potential, but 'RoboCop' remains a classic SF/action movie and a fantastic way to end a great decade of work." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "The success of this movie can be credited to one man; Paul Verhoeven. His special touch of violence, gore and social satire make the movie more than just your average B-movie, with a lame title and simple story and characters. Yes, without Verhoeven this movie seriously would had been nothing more like another B-movie on par with science-fiction/action movies like \"Timecop\" and Albert Pyun movies. The main story of \"RoboCop\" itself is simply and not that complex, however Verhoeven manages to put many different layers for the story as well as the characters in the movie. The social satire in the movie works out brilliantly and is what makes the movie perhaps more entertaining than thrilling or tense. Especially those typical Verhoeven news sketches are brilliant! But also those who will not be able to understand or fully appreciate the social satire elements in the movie, will have plenty to enjoy while watching this. The action itself is top-class and the characters are fun as well as cool. RoboCop himself looks awesome, both in his movements and the way his costume looks. Oh and of course I may not forget his awesome gun! The movie is not only filled with some typical Verhoeven social satire elements but also with some trademark Verhoeven gore and violence. The way Murphy gets killed is very graphic and disturbing. But as always in most Verhoeven movies is the case, the violence is so over-the-top that it's not really shocking to look at but almost more comical like because it's just so over-the-top. Especially what happens to Emil at the end, the gore is way over-the-top there and I absolutely love it! In a movie like this the characters are also always important. Especially the villains and yes, \"RoboCop\" has some highly entertaining and good villains. The group of Clarence, Leon, Joe and Steve are a bunch of entertaining, charismatic stereotypical villains. But also the more educated villains like Dick Jones (Ronny Cox) and Bob Morton (a very young Miguel Ferrer) who also isn't a very nice person. But also the mechanical villain ED-209 is extremely cool and dangerous looking. The stop-motion effects for him are of course heavily outdated this days but it takes away nothing of his threatening appearance. All of the character are entertaining and well developed. Characters also worth mentioning are The Old Man (Dan O'Herlihy) who plays the president of OCP and you can tell by his face gestures that he's not very pleased with the direction Dick Jones is heading towards with the company and Johnson who is always smiling. And of course let's not forget Bixby \"I'd buy that for a dollar!\" Snyder, he's a real classic! They should given that guy a real show on TV. Also the musical score by Basil Poledouris is what helps to make this movie a very memorable one. Poledouris delivers one of his best works. When will he finally get some more attention from the big awards? He has made some great stuff but he rarely has won anything of importance with it. A bit of a disgrace for such a wonderful composer. All in all this is a brilliantly entertaining science-fiction/action movie that simply is perfect in every way, mainly thanks to Verhoeven his input. 10/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "When I first saw \"Robocop\" on Showtime back in 1989, I was about 8 years old. It was definitely the most violent, and one of the most sophisticated films I'd ever seen (at that time...being 8, my dad had issues with showing me \"Blade Runner\" though he seriously wanted me to since it was first released). Everything about the film grabbed me on some level. A lot of people seem to really like this film, though I've heard a share of people and critics say that it's a second-rate film due to the extensive violence and sappy dialogue, calling it cartoon-ish. Well, I have to say that the cartoon-ish quality to the film is part of its allure. It's not only a humorous device for the sake of entertainment, but its significance to the story is great. This is a dystopian future where big companies control almost every part of our existence, from the government to the police to our domestic lives. It's almost Orwell-ian (anybody notice how the OCP building is the tallest in the city?). It's a future where criminals run rampant in every form, from street thugs to business execs. Seriously, the head villain is a greedy business suit who uses a street gang to create trouble so he can provide a solution in the form of a droid with enough firepower to put up a fight with a tank...only to have that blow up in his face and mutilate a fellow exec at its unveiling. Bill Gates never had a bad day like this. Or how about when the gang blows Murphy into a million pieces with enough shotgun ammo to make even the NRA cringe, totally destroying any remnants of his right arm. It's cartoon-ish because it's a comentary on the direction the world could conceivably take, while at the same time being a source of entertainment. Whether the entertainment value was intended for people who love to see guns blazing or for people who like to see horrifying sights (Murphy's execution, for as long as it was and as bloody as it was, HAD to demand a lot of sympathy from people...if it didn't, there's something wrong with you, and let's not forget when Robocop was getting shot up by the swat team). This film has everything going for it. A plot that exists on more levels than its B-movie surface. It's a social commentary, a satire, an action film, a sci-fi film, and at times even a comedy (when Robocop dragged the guy away by his hair, I laughed like mad). The acting is great, the effects are great (not perfect, but that adds to the visual appeal because it's as gritty as the story), the music is great (kudos to Basil Poledouris on an amazing score), and overall...this film is one of the greatest films of its genre. I wouldn't call it \"THE\" greatest, but it's very high up there. I still have yet to see the uncut Director's version, but knowing Paul Verhoeven's work as I do, I know it must be far more brutal than the domestic version (hard to grasp with how far this film goes, but...it evidently went further, showing just how cartoon-ish things can get I suppose). I give it a definite 10/10!!!" "\"RoboCop\" is a surprisingly impressive action film about a young cop (Peter Weller) who is killed by a gang of cruel criminals and is brought back to life with both human and robotic characteristics. Now he is cleaning up the city of Detroit and going after those who brutally murdered him when he was 100% human. This film is ultra-violent in every sense of the word. Anyone under the age of 17 should be strongly cautioned before seeing this film. However, the violence makes the film realistic and more exciting. Paul Verhoeven does some of his best work as a director. The screenplay is very smart for an action film and all the actors give bravura performances. Peter Weller will always be remembered as the original \"RoboCop\". Ronny Cox, Nancy Allen, Miguel Ferrer, and an incredibly evil Kurtwood Smith all do the best work of their careers. An impressive film from the action genre. 4 stars out of 5." "The thing people are starting to realize about Paul Verhoeven is that most of his films are ultimately high concept satires. Both \"Showgirls\" and \"Starship Troopers\" have been recently undergoing reevaluation and getting the critical praise that was completely absent when originally released. \"Robocop\" was Verhoeven's first American success, and while it was never damned in the way his later projects were, many viewers are just starting to pick up on the abundance of satire the material contains, even past the television parodies. The main jab is that Robocop is ostensibly the hero, but his tactics against criminals are often more brutal than the initial crimes themselves. Fortunately, audiences don't need to pay attention to the subtext to enjoy the film. In addition to being an extremely low key comedy, the film also works as an action picture. The action sequences are very well handled by Verhoeven, full of excitement and violence. Its easy to see why this was a huge box office hit when originally released. The pace never once slows down. Another memorable aspect of the picture, even more so than Robocop possibly, are the colorful villains. Ronny Cox is an underrated actor and excels here as the big business villain. Even more astonishing is Kurtwood Smith, an actor best known to my generation for playing Red on \"That 70s Show\", as one of the most hiss-worthy and flat-out sadistic bad guys ever in a film. The rest of the cast is good, but its the villains that steal the show. Overall, \"Robocop\" remains incredibly enjoyable to watch over twenty years later. (8/10)" "Robocop, born of technology is a cyborg, half man/half machine. The future of Law enforcement is here, and he's kicking ass. Alex Murphy was the unfortunate candidate chosen to be robocop after he was brutally massacred by a gang of scumbag criminals. And the robocop program was brought in, after the E.D. 209 (An all robot killing machine) proto-type failed so disastrously. Alex Murphy, now Robocop is effectively dead, but he still has a memory, and sets out on a quest to avenge his own Death, by finding the scumbags responsible. With some quite horrific violence (E.D. 209 and Murphy scenes mainly) and some brilliant action, Robocop is character that you will warm to, as he fights crime on a personal level. Solid entertainment 8/10" "In a futurist Detroit, crime is high and the police are run by a massive private company, keener to reduce running costs than reduce crime. When their new police robot ED209 develops a glitch, they turn to a prototype that blends human tissue with high-tech circuitry. Meanwhile Police officer Murphy and his partner Lewis are out gunned by criminals leaving Murphy mortally wounded. OCP take Murphy's body and use it to make Robocop. However Robocop is so successful that he is targeted by criminal Boddicker. Boddicker turns to his shadowy partners in crime, while Robocop struggles to deal with human memories and a programming system that seems designed to control him and keep him in the dark. Verhoeven's first US film was to set the mould for how the rest of his career would pan out - extreme violence and very little idea of restraint. However this is one of his best films and has much in common with one of his other best (Starship Troopers) - ultra-violence, funny black humour, great action and tonnes of satirical digs at modern life. Here the plot revolves around the creation of Robocop and his fight against crime that goes right to the top. This is complimented by the sub-plot of him trying to rediscover his human side. This is full of great action scenes and eccentric villains. The black comedy is funny, although sometimes you feel bad laughing at so much violence, but the sideswipes are the best. Verhoeven takes digs at TV with his advert filled news broadcasts, at privatisation by showing the crumbling police stations and the huge corporate towers and at heroism by showing Robocop creating just as much mayhem and destruction as the criminals he pursues. His strength however is the action scenes and the sense of tension he creates - I'll don't think anyone can forget the sheer terror of ED209's `glitch'. Weller is good - cast because of his strong jaw and ability to project emotion through a suit of armour - and he does manage to bring out the human side. Allen is good but a but dry. The real support comes from the eccentric, and well known villains and corporate bosses. Ronny Cox, Smith, Ray Wise, Perry, O'Herlihy and Miguel Ferrer are all great in various capacities. Criminal or greedy corporate leader - it's hard to tell which is which at times. A classic bit of sci-fi. Verhoeven has sadly not had a moment as fine as this since and has recently had problems being excessive in Hollywood - the land of excess! This is a landmark film that may not be to everyone's taste." "I've got the music for this movie humming in my head as I type the review. Maybe it's the effect of the movie, or the computer-game based on the movie, I'm not quite sure. Either way it's put me in a more agreeable mood towards this picture. In the future-world of `Robocop', crime is running wild. The OCP, the police of Detroit, try desperately to fight against it but it's a losing battle. When Officer Murphy is brutally gunned down by a bunch of thugs they see an opportunity to test a new technology. Infusing the body with cyber-technology they create the ultimate crime-fighting machine - the synthetic Robocop. Robocop is out to fight crime. but finds that the fight may take him places he never thought of, including inside his past that he thought erased. Acting? It's actually above average for a sci-fi flick. Peter Weller is mostly stoic and chisel-jawed here, as he should be seeing as how he's a robot. However the emotion underneath is shown in the glimpse of the eyes, the almost too-determined posture. It's subtle but it works. Those playing the villains have the real fun. They seem to have delight in playing utter pieces of scum, camping it up in a delightfully menacing fashion that's a joy to see. Speaking of camp. this movie has a great comic-book feel to it. Paul Verhoeven, and the script, have their tongue lodged firmly in their cheek as they make this movie into a satire about the way our vales are changing. The over-the-top violence of the future is reflected in a blackly humorous style by contrasting it against fake-news and ad-snippets. The sheer amount of bullets flying is too much to take in and so you are reduced to incredulity and smiles rather than horror. This is intentional, a saturation of the sensibilities. Without it the movie could feel very bleak. With it there's the feeling of adventure, and an ironic acknowledgement of our own blood-lust in movies. The tone melds with the viewer very well and makes the movie appear more intelligent than it actually probably is, which is something to be said in the IQ of 0 sci-fi culture we're often in. There's enough action throughout this movie that you're never left bored. The villains have about as much dimension as a dot, but Robocop himself has enough character to have merited the concept of a franchise (even if the follow-ups failed to live up the series' potential). It's a very entertaining piece which is told in a manner that's quite amusing. Worthy of a watch, just don't accept to be blown away. 7/10."

"In a crime ridden Detroit of the near future a corporate company OCP has the answer to fighting crime - invent a new type of policeman who won't go on strike . After the death of a policeman called Murphy they stick his body in to a metal shell . Murphy however can still remember a time when he was human I once did an evening film course called Talking Pictures which would involve watching a film then having a two hour group discussion on the film . I saw the filmography before the class started and the vast majority would be art house foreign cinema . The one exception was ROBOCOP and I knew instantly this was the one that was going to split the group right down the middle in to love it or hate it with no in between . True to form this how things worked out . Most the class despised it wondering why the class had to watch such a cartoonish commercial film . I however did state I loved it and considered it to be the third best SF movie of the 1980s behind THE TERMINATOR and ALIENS What makes ROBOCOP such a cerebral enjoyable film is the uncommon mix of social satire and no holds barred Verhoeven excess . While \" greed is good \" to a certain extent the idea of corporate capitalism is something to be rejected . A small self elected clique ruling over the Universe in order to maximise profits is a bad mix of capitalism meets self serving communism . Not so much a mixed economic system but more a combination of greedy speculators from one system being merged with the unthinking party loyalty of the other system . It's greed for money plus greed for power which is a marriage made in hell and being dead isn't enough to make you escape the clutches of OCP and the film revolves around the human element of Murphy remembering who he once was and it's this that is at the core of the movie Of course Verhoeven isn't a director who does sentimental mawkish stuff and I doubt if the audience was wanting to see a Walt Disney film . What they were wanting to see was bad things happen to very bad people and you can't help cheering as criminals get killed , maimed , mutilated and in one case melted . It's a violent film but one that is so cartoonish that the violence is not to be taken seriously , a fact reflected in the loud slightly unrealistic acting style . This attitude wasn't enough to stop its British network premiere on ITV becoming farcical with a TV version being broadcast with notorious lines like \" you gonna be a bad mother crusher \" along with key scenes like the ones with mister melty conspicuous by their absence There is of course a new version of ROBOCOP hitting the cinema this week but is a film I have no interest in watching judging by the clips I've seen of it . It's strange to think that another Verhoeven classic TOTAL RECALL was also recently remade . As it stands the original ROBOCOP remains one of the greatest genre films from the 1980s containing wit , satire and enjoyably mean carnage" "Detroit is under siege by a corrupt CEO in the police department...also by rapists, robbers, and the group of thugs who murdered Officer Murphy. Murphy (flawlessly played by Peter Weller) was a family man with a big heart whose body is eventually 'saved' by tech-geniuses, transforming him into a robot-cop (with a big heart, natch). The violence in the film is incredibly brutal in the manner of \"Death Wish\", yet it can almost be overlooked--even deemed necessary--in the context of the plot. Weller exudes sensitivity (not easy to do under that coat of armor), and he's matched very well by Ronny Cox (delightfully sinister and sniveling) and spunky Nancy Allen (in her best performance). A bleak vision of the future, though one which offers hope underneath its chestplate of destruction. Followed by \"RoboCop 2\" in 1990, \"RoboCop 3\" in 1993, and a television series in 1994. ***1/2 from ****" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This was a film that I enjoyed watching when I was a kid and it was my favorite film. Now, years later I just watched it and I was hesitant because I thought it would be cheesy, but it was amazing. It is ultra violent even by today's standards. It is a great mix of action and sci-fi and it has a message. You would not have to look hard into this film to see some deeper meaning in it, though it appears to just be a action film it is also a testament to human life. One of the most prominent messages in this film is that you can put a human in a robotic shell but he is still a human. It also has messages about corporations running our lives. There is a scene where the main character has been killed and the company that owns the police is about to turn him into Robocop and someone says is this OK and the corporate rep says \"we own him, we can do whatever we like with him.\" It is a classic film and one that has to be watched by everybody. It disappoints me that in every top 100 movies list or somethings like that you will never see this film, I think it is a classic and is one of the most underrated films of all time." "Back when I was the proud owner of a top of the range ZX Spectrum +2a, Robocop was probably the best platform game that I ever played. It had every thing you could want from a game: A good plot, great graphics and really cool guns! I hadn't seen the film at this point, I'm not sure why, I was way too young, yes, but that has never stopped anyone, least of all me. When I did get around to seeing the film (I still would have been underage) I loved it! It had everything: A good plot, good effects and it had really cool guns!! A few years ago, given a gentle prod by an interview with the director, I sat down and watched Robocop from a different standpoint and bugger me it was even better, it had everything: Social comment, religious overtones, biting satire and really cool guns! When Murphy is killed at the beginning of the film it's because he's a policeman, a man who gives his life to help others, a man who has no crimes and no sins. He has a wife and child and lives an idyllic life despite working to help the beaten and bedraggled, the down trodden and helpless. He's persecuted, crucified and when the scientists get hold of him they seal him in a metal tomb from which they believe he can never escape. I'm being unsubtle here but there really is no need to beat around the bush with these things. Murphy is being depicted as a Messiah for 21st Century America, a messiah as the America dictates, a messiah, that is, with really cool guns! Robocop is, despite this, a VERY funny film. But is it a piece of Hollywood trash masquerading as intelligent cinema? Or is a clever comment on America masquerading as trash? Well, let's face it, it's both! The social commentary on how big business is big crime and money is the route of all evil is as clumsy as it is obvious. However, the accusatory tone it adopts when dealing with its hero is superbly realised and works brilliantly because of it. Robocop is a character ripped from a 50's comic strip; he is violent but just, mechanical but warm and yet still, somehow, attractive to women. The director pokes fun at the ease with which he attracts the audience to his central character and develops the messiah characteristics almost as a joke on his own creation. He knows Robocop is too good to be true and has fun raising his status to king of men, even having him walk on water as he extracts his revenge on the men who 'killed' him. The real twist for me is that in order to dispense with the man who masterminded the criminal activities he has been investigating, Robocop has to break the rules. Having already begun to regain his memories and escape his tomb he proceeds to OCP to meet his Nemesis. Robocop wants to kill him, he needs to kill him, and the only way he can escape his tomb is to destroy the man who put him in it. Yet his directives, his internal rules-set down by someone else- that guide his life forbid him to do it! Thall Shalt Not Kill. You've all seen the film, you all know what happens. So what is Verhoevan saying about his messiah for the 21st century?" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "\"Robocop\" was what gave the world the robotic police officer that would rival the Terminator as the greatest cyborg film character of all time. Although, I'm not gonna take a side in that debate, but I am gonna give Robocop the recognition it deserves. He was something that was totally new at the time (1987), and since then the movie got 2 (crappy) sequels, a comic book and a mini-series. Robocop is set in the future and portrays a very dark version of Detroit, and its crime level has gone up considerably. In it, a cop named Alex Murphy gets literally blown away by a gang of nasty criminals on his first day on the job. But later a company (OCP) uses his remains to build a mechanical cop in order to cut down on the crime in order to build \"Delta City\" to replace the corrupted dystopia that was once Detroit. Later on, Robocop makes a name for himself around the city, but unexpectedly he starts remembering what he was before his death, and through this we start to learn more about Murphy since we didn't zilch about him before he died. And this is how he starts to regain his lost humanity. And the first rule about making a movie with a robot for a character is that you MUST make it human in some way, that's the reason why Robocop worked so well and why \"Terminator 2\" worked so well. Towards the ending, after he takes off his helmet for the final battle, reveals his face. And a little later, after the Old Man asks him for his name, he replies \"Murphy\", this is one of the most heart-touching moments in science fiction which generally don't have moments like those. The symbolism in here is perfect. Another thing that really got me were the bad guys. And the best of the gang is without a doubt, Kurtwood Smith as Clarence Boddicker. Honestly, I have never seen a guy who looks like a 50 year old pencil pusher to be so threatening. He delivers his lines with such ferocity and perfection that he becomes perhaps one of the greatest villains in the history of cinema. And his classic lines, \"Can you fly, Bobby?\" and \"B*****s, leave!\" will never be forgotten. Also, his crew is worth noting, Emil will be known for the gas station scene (probably the best part of the movie), Joe will be remembered for his laugh and his \"Does it hurt? Does it hurt?\" line. And Leon will be recognized for his hilarious expression he makes when the disfigured Emil confronts him and when Robocop pulls his hair in the dance club. And lastly Clarence will be known for pretty much everything he does and says in here. And all these guys are MEAN, plain and simple. They basically kill and hurt others for their own amusement and express no pity or remorse at all. These guys are as real as movie villains could possibly get. The action is excellent, the gas station scene was bad@$$, the drug factory shootout was fantastic and the ending when Robocop takes out all the bad guys in the same place where they killed him at the steel mill is unforgettable, thanks to the Cobra Assault Cannons (forgot what they're called), but it's one of the sweetest weapons ever made up in a film. The one liners couldn't have been better. \"Dead or alive, you're coming with me\" is a quote that should've been on the Top 100, but for some reason, it's not. \"Your move, creep\" is another worth mentioning. And the before mentioned stuff that the bad guys say are pretty cool to say in real life situations as well. Robocop is a classic in the golden age of science fiction when we didn't have too many of that over-the-top, unoriginal crap that we're getting now. I'm gonna cherish this movie forever, and I hope you will too." "\"RoboCop\" is the sort of movie that seems like it would be more than idiotic if you only hear about it once. But it turns out to actually be quite good. Less of an action movie than a look at urban decay, the movie makes the most of its potential at every turn. Officers Alex J. Murphy (Peter Weller) and Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen) patrol the streets of crime-ridden Detroit. One day, while tracking down a gang, Murphy gets cornered and shot to death. But that's not the end of him; a group of scientists turns him into the steel-clad title character. Before too long, RoboCop is out fighting crime like never before. In the process, he not only decides to find the gang that killed him, but also investigates a conspiracy going to the city's highest levels of government. Watching the movie, you get the feeling that everyone must have had a lot of fun making it. It's really neat now that I know that Kurtwood Smith - aka Red Foreman on \"That '70s Show\" - played one of the gang members. Paul Verhoeven, who turned out the masterpiece \"Soldier of Orange\" in his native Netherlands, created something more than cool here. You'll love it." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "\"Robocop\" is one of those movies that inspires debate, as well it should. The director, Paul Verhoeven (who later became an even bigger player with films like \"Total Recall\" and \"Basic Instinct\") has definitely indulged in extreme violence and has no qualms about presenting violence as an object of fun. But I would defend it even if its only virtue was its action sequences because those elements are handled so well. There's a number of imaginatively staged action scenes, and it never devolves into an arcade-style shooting gallery like so many 80s actions films do. The action is compelling because of Verhoeven's style and because he's given the characters enough substance that we care about what happens to them, including at least a half dozen interesting villains. A lot of discussion has revolved around whether or not this film deserves to be called satire. Those looking for Moliere-like pearls in Verhoeven's modestly amusing commercial interruptions are understandably disappointed. This isn't the kind of movie that you can look at or objectify in order to access its ideas on an intellectual level. It's a different kind of beast: it must be entered into, it must fulfill its function as an action narrative first and foremost and it carries its ideas like a wedding train dragged by a semi-truck a prominent after-thought. At any rate I feel it's closer to camp than satire, one of the first camp action films of the 80s style I would argue (\"Remo Williams\" being another, now largely forgotten). It's a good drinking movie, and this most recent time when I watched it my friend and I were laughing and yelling so much that we probably missed half the dialog. But I don't think we missed much of the point. If it was a satire, Robocop wouldn't emerge as such a serious figure invested with pathos and personality. The movie itself is best enjoyed in my opinion as a joyride with some interesting commentary about America's relationship to violence thrown in by way of farce; you wait for each villain to meet his fitting end and watch the carnage pile up. The villains are all so easy to hate, and all the actors playing them are having a lot of fun. Ronny Cox is fantastic as the corporate heel, but I've always enjoyed Kurtwood Smith the most. Really this is a very well-cast movie all around. I love the scene where Miguel Ferrer has his coke party interrupted by Smith with his bomb and his video. It's easy to underestimate the kind of skill Smith shows when he's so funny and obviously has his tongue in cheek but still manages to be convincingly sadistic and evil. Honestly, a comparison to Vincent Price in his heyday is not unwarranted. Weller for his part is adequate and it's a difficult role so that's no insult. I didn't care for Nancy Allen in the movie but I can't really put my finger on the reasons. I guess she just came across as very tentative. I think it was a small mistake for Verhoeven to have her play it in a more grounded mode; his butt-kicking females are more fascinating but he does always have problems directing female heroes (see \"Showgirls\" and \"Total Recall\" for example). I think this is a pretty intelligent movie with some layers to it. It's better as science fiction than you would at first suspect, mining Frankenstein territory in a number of scenes  particularly where the callous nature of the creator is shown (\"lose the arm\") and when the police force turns on Robocop like the mob of angry villagers in Whale's film version. In Shelley's time perhaps a single scientist was a suitable object of terror, but by choosing corporate monster-makers the writers of this film gave the story a far more prescient object for paranoia. Indeed, even since I last saw the film in the late 90s, the film's central premise has become even more relevant due to America's misadventures with corporate security forces in Iraq. This time around I noticed all the elements of Western parody in the film. Not just the twirling pistol (which also, interestingly, performs a plot function by identifying Robocop as Murphy) but also in various other scenes. For example one poster here complained about the \"generic\" or obligatory nature of the convenience store scene and the rape scene where Robocop is introduced as a hero. I couldn't disagree more. They parallel the arrival of the hero in a traditional Western; the convenience store works for the trading post in \"Shane\", the nightclub scene doubles for a tavern brawl (i.e. the beginning of \"Rio Bravo\") and the attempted rape parallels any number of damsel in distress scenarios. That's a very funny scene for me because of the way the girl goes up to Robocop after he rescues her and kind of drapes herself over him (\"My hero!\"), a very prototypical American bit that you'd see in a Randolph Scott Western from the 40s. Robocop's sterile reaction is perfect, again a parody of the emotionless law enforcing gunfighter of the Old West of American mythology. I expect to find more and more interesting elements the more I watch the film over the years. I think recently its reputation has taken a slight hit  look at the interesting life this film has had. Originally it was a big hit both in theaters and on video. Over the years it was not forgotten because action movie fans would return to it and be surprised at how well it holds up and how many ideas are floating about beneath the surface. Then based on their recommendations movie-goers of a more intellectual bent gave the movie a chance and were disappointed. It's time for the pendulum to swing back and for the movie to be reclaimed as what it is  an intelligent violent film." "RoboCop is a very good but violent film that in My opinion is not for kids. I say not for kids because unlike most films the violence it shows is very graphic. Though the film is somewhat sad but the film is never boring and has good acting. Peter Weller did an outstanding job being RoboCop! Ronny Cox puts on a great performance but to me his role is similar to his role in Total Recall and Kurtwood Smith was good aswell. Miguel Ferrer was good and Nancy Allen looked good. Great music by Basil Poledouris and good direction by veteran director Paul Verhoeven. This is the first of a three film series. This is a great film for action and sci-fi fans alike!" "Robocop is Truly a great violent movie. Packed with plenty of blood and Violence, this is one entertaining movie. Set in Detroit, one of the most violent city's, Robocop is the story of a police killed by a ruthless gang. He is later used in a experiment, and becomes the half man half machine, Robocop. Peter Sellers gives us the best movie of his entire career. Paul Verhoevan has made some great film like Basic Instict, Hollow Man, Starship troopers and Total Recall. I think Robocop, is still is best work out of the lot. It is the best out of the Robocop trilogy by a margin. The Second part was entertaining in some scenes and is worth watching. The third was a absolute disaster, with nothing great about it, apart from robot Ninjas. Watch Robocop 1, it is a fabulous movie." "Director Paul Verhoven, the director of TOTAL RECALL unleashes a very original film, that despite what my first thought upon seeing commercials was, is not a copy off of the Terminator. The actors are not very famous, but sometimes the best films have no name actors-and sometimes you get the best performances out of them because they're not full of themselves. The blend of sci-fi, action, and thriller was very good, and the stunts and action scenes themselves were memorable. Overall ROBOCOP is a very under-rated film (in the way of critics and popularity) but for anyone who's seen it, they know when it's over that THEY have found an entertaining blockbuster. That's how films like 'Speed' and such were accepted so well. Audiences not only can recognize with the characters symbolically, but they can also sit on the edge of their seats. Such a film is Robocop. A very entertaining at the most, well done film. I give it a good rating-it's just pure entertainment! 3.5/5 STARS--" "Add another review" "Find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your Watchlist and rate your favorite movies and TV shows on your phone or tablet!")("Movies, TV & Showtimes" "Celebs, Events & Photos" "News & Community" "Watchlist" "" "Find industry contacts & talent representation" "Manage your photos, credits, & more" "Showcase yourself on IMDb & Amazon" "Sign in with Facebook Other Sign in options" "Own the rights?" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "SOME SPOILERS \"You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.\" - The Miranda Warning For me, one of the best parts of \"RoboCop\" comes at the very end. An old man asks the robot, \"What's your name, son?\" The robot cop turns his head, sports a wan smile, and says, \"Murphy.\" Then as he turns to start to walk away the camera cuts to black and the theme song roars in as we read the bold print on-screen that says, \"ROBOCOP.\" \"RoboCop\" could be called a rip-off of \"The Terminator\" in many senses. The trailer even used the exact same theme song as that of \"Terminator.\" But \"RoboCop\" is a different story in many ways, and, in some ways, the action is even better than that in \"The Terminator\" (though I must include that the latter film is a better one overall). The film's hero, RoboCop, has a gentle affection to him absent in the evil \"Terminator,\" mainly because he is still human in some ways. It starts with a man named Murphy (Peter Wellers). Amid talks of a police strike, he and his new partner (Nancy Allen) chase down a pack of criminals to an abandoned warehouse. After being caught, graphically tortured and then shot in the head by the gang, Murphy is shipped off to a hospital whereupon he is announced dead on arrival. However, Murphy is revived by fusing his body together with that of a machine robot named \"RoboCop,\" the \"future of law enforcement.\" RoboCop is a cop who will never hold a strike against the police force, never take a bribe, never become corrupt in any way. There is only one problem with RoboCop--he has flashbacks of his past life and family. He also remembers who killed him. And so RoboCop sets off to find his killers. \"RoboCop\" is an action man's action movie. Things blow up, people get killed, and there are some impressive stunts. But all the while the movie keeps true to its core. The simple premise behind the film is nothing more than a B-movie so typically found in the era of the eighties (a decade of some very memorable, very forgettable, and/or cheesy films). But it's nevertheless brought out of mediocrity by its lead performance from Peter Wellers, whose acting skills seemed pretty bad out of the suit rather than inside it, where he seems at home. Wellers (a.k.a. Buckaroo Bonzai) also extends a technique Arnold Schwarzenegger used in \"The Terminator.\" As a cyborg, Schwarzenegger would turn his head, then let the body follow. Wellers' character is even more rigid and robotic in movements than the T-800, and so he turns his head, for example, far to the right, and after a second his body spins on its heels and follows the head. Something like that takes a lot of concentration--just try walking around like that. Now add acting and remembering your lines. Wellers does a pretty good job. The director, Paul Verhoeven, knows how to construct a well-oiled action vehicle. He skips the bull and gets right to the harcore blood and guts stuff. But he does manage to bring a certain sense of connection with the character--and a sense of morals. Given another director, \"RoboCop\" would have been an average 80s film at best. Its plot vaguely resembles \"The Terminator,\" and the script isn't always A material. But Paul Verhoeven knows when and where to insert touching scenes (like when RoboCop goes through his old home and sees flashbacks), and he firmly grips the point of the story (messing with nature can be dangerous, not only physically but emotionally for the person you screwed around with). Another director helming a movie like this would never have thought to include such things. Unfortunately, Verhoeven does not know how to construct a film about a strip club (see \"Showgirls\"), but that's another story. \"RoboCop\" had amazing potential for sequels. Murphy's quest to find his family, to unlock his past, and to continue fighting crime are all the sort of stuff you hear about in comic books and comic book films. Unfortunately, the two sequels that followed \"RoboCop\" were major drags--the sort of films that \"RoboCop\" avoided becoming ever so carefully. Overblown, cheesy, stupid action flicks with no plot nor affection. As it stands, the third film has exactly 3.3 out of 10 stars on the IMDb, giving it a place on the Website's list of worst films of all time. I wouldn't go so far as to say the sequels were necessarily some of the worst films of all time, but after watching \"RoboCop\" you have an odd starvation to dig deeper into the film franchise and deeper into the story. The sequels kind of negate that starvation. \"RoboCop\" is a superhero movie, make no mistake about it. But it's an extraordinary one--an action film that starts and never lets up on its goals. And all the while it presents a truly lovable main character who is nothing more than a robot. In a time when every single action film out there presents us with overblown budgets, crappy acting, writing, directing, horrible buddies, and nothing but special effects we've seen mimicked since the release of \"The Matrix,\" \"RoboCop\" is a gentle reminder that, at one time, action movies were what they were--action movies--and the directors, writers and actors behind them had a wide range of talent. \"RoboCop\" is a B-movie, but movies of this B-quality are simply not made anymore. 5/5 stars. - John Ulmer" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "\"The sooner we admit our capacity for evil, the less apt we are at destroying one another.\" - Paul Verhoeven. Most of Verhoeven's films deal with different forms of fascism or excess. As a child, Verhoeven himself witnessed firsthand the brutalities of the Second World War. Indeed, the German Army occupied Verhoeven's own hometown, and quickly implemented a policy of \"enforced conformity\" (Gleichschaltung), shutting down all non Nazi organisations and forcing strict curfews and laws upon the Dutch population. Verhoeven himself was lined up against a wall and heckled by a German execution squad. They fired their rifles up into the air, and teased him for wetting his pants. It thus seems only normal that, later in his life, Verhoeven would become contemptuous of man. His films are routinely violent, bloody, and satirical, and some even broadcast disguised contempt for we the audience. Verhoeven's \"heroes\" are themselves often base, nasty creatures, whether they live in war-torn Europe or the contemporary psychedelia of Western techno-capitalism. Indeed, films like \"Robocop\", \"Total Recall\", \"Basic Instinct\", \"Starship Troopers\" and \"Showgirls\" all revel in a kind of tawdry decadence. Ugly, crass and loud, they're mock-celebrations of junk, money, lights and noise. Verhoeven seems to believe that Americans are capable of responding only to idiocy and base stimuli. Verhoeven's two science fiction films, \"Robocop\" and \"Starship Troopers\", are his most openly critical. Simultaneously pandering to and sneering at lug-heads, these films manages a strange juggling act; both consist of a number of ironic jokes aimed at sophisticated audience members, yet are also devoted to B movie gore and violence. The simple notion of \"revenge\" also drives both films, Verhoeven's audience whipped up in a frenzy of both blood lust and revenge. Perhaps what Verhoeven does best in these films is highlight how complacency and stupidity are prerequisites to different forms of control and abuse. \"Robocop\" makes this implicit with its truncated 3 minute news bulletins (for its ADD society), its consumer catchphrases, its themes of dehumanisation - through technology (robocop), capitalism (OCP) and the media (\"I'll buy that for a dollar!\") - all of which point to a world in which man is too busy bowing to biochemical impulses than look around. The film is so cynical, that it even suggests that the bad guys are funded by the same omniscient company that funds the military and police force. In this future world, capitalism has evolved to the point where it shoots itself in the foot just to sell itself band-aids. Verhoeven's other films do similar things. \"Basic Instinct\" and \"Showgirls\" are not full blown satires, but they are deliberately garish, mocking the very sex and sleaze they trade in. Verhoeven's Hollywood filmography itself seems like a calculated assault on sex (Basic Instinct, Hollowman, Showgirls), money and violence (Robocop, Starship Troopers), America's chief excesses. Significantly, Verhoeven's also had long-time plans to film a religious movie. 7.9/10  Some kind of classic." "For the sake of posterity, I must register my opinion of \"Robocop\", but there's not much to say that hasn't already been said. The film is a science fiction masterpiece, but it's not a heavy-handed one like \"2001\" or a ponderous one like \"Blade Runner\". It is packed not only with action and the most explicit of screen violence, but with incisive ideas and frightening concepts about the future, many of which have already come to pass. Director Paul Verhoeven, who has made great films like \"Turkish Delight\" \"Spetters\", \"The 4th Man\" and the awesome \"Starship Troopers\", directs with amazing skill and energy, and injects a vein of black humor that elevates this to levels way beyond previous genre watersheds. No masterpiece lacks a brilliant screenplay, and the screenplay here is just that. Few science fiction films in history have so masterfully combined great ideas with violent action, sharp characterization and jaw-dropping special effects. The film's most brutal set piece -- the gunning down of Murphy (Peter Weller) -- is one of cinema's most harrowing and tragic achievements, a hard, cruel punch to the gut and emotions that sweeps us into the film's amazing second act. The performances are flawless, the villains are incredibly mean-spirited, and the special visual and make-up effects are superb. If you want to know how to make great science fiction, \"Robocop\" is a great place to start." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Ahhh...Robocop. How I've missed you. The tale of one man's death and rebirth into a formidable robotic killing machine really tugs at my heartstrings. From the brilliant action scenes (Clarence running down Emil and turning him into a splash of toxic sludge is genius), to the acting (Miguel Ferrier is especially good here as Bob Morton, Robocop's creator. Too bad he bought the farm halfway through the film. Maybe he can come back in Robocop 4 as an apparition?), the actors themselves (Peter Weller does an admirable job as Robo, and Nancy Allen is still hot, no matter what anyone says), and even the in-jokes about corporate control and capitalism, you can't help but love this film. Everyone should see it immediately. Bottom Line: Watch this and not the two sub-par sequels that followed...but you could try watching the TV series. Or the cartoon series. If you want." "I've a very personal connection to RoboCop. It's been my favourite movie since I first saw it 25 years ago and was also the first truly adult film I'd seen at that time in my life. It's extreme violence shocked me and left and indelible mark, it's vile, memorable villains, breakneck pace and frenetic action were like nothing I'd ever seen. I have revisited the film at various ages over the years and have regularly reappraised it, each time trying to gauge it objectively without the haze of nostalgia. Whilst other movies I loved in my youth now rate far less favourably with me when viewed as an adult, RoboCop is as good now as it was all those years ago. As an adult I now clearly see the deeper thematic elements such as the commentary on 80's corporate greed and Verhoven's Christ allegory of Murphy's crucifixion and resurrection. The most powerful aspects of the movie are some of the more emotional elements such as Murphy's \"I can feel them, but I can't remember them\" scene and Murphy going to the abandoned family home, all played with perfectly balanced pathos by Peter Weller who puts in a career best performance in a very difficult, unconventional acting role. The script and editing are second to none. It careens from one classic scene to another yet is perfectly paced. There is no scene that feels surplus to requirements, no fat on the meat. It's tone is also very unique, due in no greater part to its director's style. Verhoven employs a hyper-realism, gun shot wounds look as horrific as they would in real life, the use of a non-scripted crash team to work on saving Murphy after he's shot, all these things give a pleasing sheen of authenticity to the film. Special mention must go to the film's technical aspects, namely the great production design and the RoboCop suit designed by Rob Bottin who also did the film's superb practical effects. The designs of RoboCop's suit and Craig Davies' imposing ED-209 have aged extremely well and have a timeless quality. And let's not forget Basil Poledouris' majestic score. It perfectly complements the film and is both equal parts rousing and mournfully melodic. One of the things RoboCop is most famous for is the aforementioned violence and indeed it is uber violent but the violence is an intrinsic factor that adds to the film's unique quality. Never before had such brutal, graphic, sadistic violence been portrayed in a major Hollywood movie. Again this is Verhoven's doing. Coming from Holland where there was no equivalent of the MPAA he was able to do as he wished as a film maker in his native country. He grew up during the Nazi occupation of Holland and violence was something he saw frequently and this shows in much of his work and none more so than here where it is used to great effect to instill sympathy in Murphy's character who doesn't get a great amount of screen time before being so brutally killed and it also paints this future Detroit as a cold merciless place. It never feels excessive when seen in context of the movie but is certainly not for the faint hearted. Whilst on the subject, special mention must go to Kurtwood Smith's exceptionally vile and sadistic Clarence Boddiker, easily a contender for Best Movie Villain Ever. RoboCop is very much a product of the 80's, particularly Reagan's 80's America and this is in no way to its detriment. Indeed as the recent neutered, generic, typically modern Hollywood remake shows, they'd never be able to make a film this visceral these days. It even manages to be strangely prophetic - the real city of Detroit recently filing bankruptcy and Downtown Dallas, Houston, where the bulk of it was filmed now more than ever looking like the Old Detroit seen in the film. The film has in it's arsenal, amongst other things, an incredible, almost mythical third act which is more Western than Sci-Fi. From the point where Lewis goes back to the Steel Mill to bring Murphy supplies the film starts to peak and doesn't let up until the incredibly satisfying final scene which scored off the chart with test audiences causing the originally planned final Media Break ending to be dropped leaving the \"Nice shooting son, what's your name?\" ending we have now. For me this film has it all, a great script with endlessly quotable dialogue, great performances across the board, great effects that service the film instead of acting as a distraction, a superb score, perfect editing, a classic revenge theme, The Greatest Film Location Ever (The Old Steel Mill), the list goes on. I'll finish with this, don't look beyond the original RoboCop as it's greatness is only sullied by the poor sequels and dire TV series that followed. Instead see it as it should have remained, an undiluted classic, a masterpiece of modern film making with wit, brutality but also a very clearly defined soul. Nice shooting indeed!" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "There is a cornucopia of action scenes in this movie, so the Arnold Schwarzenegger demographic won't be disappointed. Guns of every type are deployed and powerful semi-automatic pistols are the least of them. There are heavily armed robots weighing a ton that walk with reverberating thumps. There's a van with a murderer at the wheel that embeds itself into a huge tank labeled \"Toxic Waste\" and we see the driver melt before our eyes. And then there's Peter Weller as the half-human cyborg cop, ripped apart by bullets, reassembled with electronic components by villainous Ronnie Cox who heads the OCP corporation. When this first showed up on television I caught a few minutes of Weller's titanium-coated figure blasting some people to pieces and thought, \"Oh, (expletive deleted), another comic strip hero brought to life.\" But, having just watched it through, I think it's rather more than just another mindless superhero story. Neither the director, Paul Verhoeven, nor his two writers ever went anywhere after this, but they hit the ball with \"Robocop\" as typical action movie, black comedy, and social commentary. The opening is hilarious. It's a satire on the evening news. Two handsome, cheerful faces -- one bland guy and one Leeza Gibbons who looks like she could eat a man alive -- run through the news of the world in the near future -- riots here and there, police strikes, a war at the Mexican border, and so on. Cut to a commercial for some heart transplant business. Some huckster with silvery hair, a television actor's voice, and a white coat and stethoscope takes us through the corporation's offices, telling us we get to choose our own heart at a discount price, even \"the Jarvik model,\" and he grins and holds up a model of the artificial heart, which looks like two pink plastic concertinas glued together. \"And remember -- we care.\" Another commercial advertises the new Model 6000 \"Sux\" car, which boasts 8.2 miles to the gallon. Later, the news anchors tell us about a tragic incident in which dozens of satellites forming a missile shield (\"the Peace Platform\") have gone awry and struck the earth with lasers, killing more than one hundred people -- a human tragedy. And who built the lasers? OCP. \"Hell, we practically are the military,\" remarks Cox. Everything is being privatized. \"The military/industrial complex\" has become \"the militaryindustrial complex.\" The corporation runs everything. Hospitals, construction, social control, security, \"urban pacification\", energy, the whole magilla. And OCP makes worse mistakes than the government, if that's possible. At a board meeting, Cox introduces a two-ton super robot that will replace human cops. To demonstrate, he has a board member hold a gun. The robot orders him to put down the gun, giving him fifteen seconds to comply. The frightened suit complies but somehow the robot continues its countdown. The two dozen other board members dive out of the way as the robot blasts the innocent victim to bloody shreds. \"A big glitch,\" somebody mutters. Nobody mentions the dead man. It's just that the failure makes the company look bad. The basic plot has Peter Weller, who is only half a man, slowly recovering his memory and his identity. As he goes about obeying orders and trying to enforce the law, he's smitten by all sorts of objects and weapons. He's not entirely invulnerable either. Like Achilles, he has a vulnerable spot -- his lips and cheeks -- that never seem to suffer any damage. And he's human enough to bleed when his armor is punctured. By the end, he's removed his helmet so that we can see Weller's hairless face and part of his head. He's recovered his memory completely too. He answers to the name of Murphy and even smiles. A dreadful thought occurs to me at this point. With it's sour view of privatization and corporate culture, in some sectors of social space this is going to be interpreted as socialist propaganda. That's not actually the case, though. OCP is run by the avuncular and well-meaning old Dan O'Herlihy. The flies in the corporate ointment are Ronnie Cox, Miguel Ferrer, and the smarmy henchmen they hire to do their wet work and their cocaine running. The henchmen are led by Kurtwood Smith, who has never done anything on screen but lead henchmen. When you see Kurtwood Smith headed your way, you know there's trouble. You just don't know whether it will be prolonged and debilitating like prostate cancer or quick and painless like a severe stroke. The modern screen is full of splinter-group villains. They've included Russians, the IRA, and the CIA. Not the originals but some violent cabal within the group. Let's not offend anyone who might buy a ticket. Still -- inside this prototypical, titanium-coated, two-ton action movie behemoth there is a humanitarian trying to get out. And I get down on my knees and grovel in gratitude that the writers and director had the decency never to let Weller's half-human face show any tears, not even during the moments that were nearest the sentimental." "Spoilers Ahead: Want to appreciate this treasure? Watch the lobotomized, badly acted, boring piece of crap sequel. Look, if you are so inventive, could you stop stealing our movies and turning them into crap? Put down the comic book, write something original like this generation did. An action movie rises or falls predicated upon its villains; this has two excellent ones Dick Jones and Clarence. They can act, by the way, as can Weller. He doesn't look and sound like he had a massive stroke with a glassy eyed, dumb ass stare. Verhoeven fills the movie with biting, trenchant satire the breadth of the entire 80s Yuppies culture. Weller makes you care about him with his acting ability coupled with the real suffering Clarence and the boys mete out to him. The alliance between Jones and Clarence is well developed and understandable not introduced and then disappearing; I don't know maybe they ran out of crayons for the new script? When you compare both of the Vorhoeven's treasures that were bastardized by the lobotomies, this and Total Recall, what you notice, right away, is the drop in intellectual content. This movie is not just a great action picture; note, it contains action, not four scenes, two of which are training exercises. The acting, writing and directing are so superior. Satire requires much more intelligence than a straightforward narrative. This movie moves very well, has biting satire with great humor. Ferrer's Bob Morton is worth owning the movie for, what a depiction of a cut throat take no prisoners executive. I will be honest with you, it was after watching the abomination that is the remake, that I really appreciated this movie more. As soon as I was done, I put this one in to cleanse my mind. Yes, all of Vorhoeven's movies are quite violent, this is certainly no exception. It also is quite intense, fast moving and you will not be bored for one minute. Even with the dated effects, the dialog is funny and sarcastic. Weller's acting ability dwarfs lobotomy boy. The new guy has this expressionless insouciance devoid of one scintilla of inflection in his voice. For everyone who has not seen the remake, watch it then watch this over, believe me, you will have a new found respect for Vorhoeven's film. Cox out-acts Keaton badly in comparison, it is not even close. The real difference is the intelligence of the writing: everything is in the proper place and depth. We get his assembly but it doesn't consume half the movie. Also, his trip back to his family is but a detour here, in the remake it eats twenty minutes out of the film. You have no idea how utterly brain dead the remake is until you revisit this movie. All the cutting jabs at our culture, the intense corporate infighting and throat cutting which gave the original its bite has been castrated out of the remake. This movie is also free of the Deus Ex Machina ontology for retards that we have to endure in the remake. Look, it is RoboCop not Being and Nothingness? They think if they throw ontological babble at you it makes up for a boring, badly acted piece of crap. The cast and the writing are the stars of this film. Weller, Cox, Ferrer and Kurtwood Smith tower over the cheese ball group of a no talented ensemble with the exception of Oldman. Keaton is so lost in the remake; hey, he tried menacing in Pacific Heights, it is out of his range, Hello? Do yourself a big favor, make yourself watch the Curious George version of RoboCop before you re-watch this classic. A Very Good Cutting Satire. \"A Wise Man Strives For Clarity; A Fool For Obscurity.\" Schopenhauer" "In future Detroit, the crime rate has gone through the roof, the police are on strike and a private corporation has taken over the police force. After the death of one of their rookie officers (Peter Weller), they try some experimental surgery and create RoboCop. This film is vastly underrated, perhaps due in part to the stinky sequels. The plot is brilliant, the political undertones are there... we have action, we have science fiction, perhaps even a touch of horror. There are the intentional metaphors and symbolism that hark back to Frankenstein and even Jesus Christ. I will not even begin to talk about privatization... The cast and crew are quite impressive. Rob Bottin, quite possibly the best special effects wizard in history, was there to see things through and gave us such excellent moments as \"the incredible melting man\". The incredible Nancy Allen, in one of her landmark performances (and maybe her best outside a Brian DePalma film). And Wisconsin's own Peter Weller. Hard to believe Orion studio head Mike Medavoy pushed for Arnold Schwarzenegger. Big mistake, and we are fortunate Weller won the role. What is really amusing is how they used the backdrop of Detroit, rather than one of the more traditional film settings. Because, as we all know, Detroit today (2010-2015) is a crime-ridden cesspool. I find it hard to believe that this film shows life all that much worse than it really is in Detroit today. The film has been released in various formats, including from the Criterion Collection. The MGM 20th Anniversary edition DVD is particularly strong. The list of features is almost endless, and the double disc offers two versions of the film. And, of course, the excellent audio commentary. All that really remains is the possibility of upgraded picture and sound. (A blu-ray release may have that already.)" "This is one of the best science fiction films ever made. Unfortunately, neither the sequels nor a T.V series could top this entertaining mix of action,humor and emotion. Robocop 2 relied a little too much on action and not enough emotion. Robocop 3 could have been good if they had written a better storyline and script. The story in 3 just did not work out with audiences, and that's why it got such negative reviews. If there ever is a Robocop 4 i hope that they bring back Paul Verhoven, The director of the first. Maybe he can help bring Robocop back to life. The producers could not wait to make sequels and that is why they weren't like the original" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This movie is about as close to perfection as one gets. It has a great story, great acting (good emotion on the part of Weller as Robo), the amount of violence is perfect (not over-the-top like Robocop 2, not too watered down like Robocop 3). The villains (both the street thugs and the wealthy businessmen) are so dangerous than they're downright scary in their ruthlessness, and the heroes are brave (though a bit too red, white and blue). It's the kind of film that inspires one to be righteous, and stronger, and in some situations, it may even persuade you to become a cop :) There are deeper meanings to it also. The shame of big business is obvious as it explicitly described how OCP gives cops inferior products, like faulty body armor that are said to not work, in the hopes that the police will go on strike and, as a result, OCP will have a very lucrative contract to provide the city with \"security\" (ie, protection for the rich). There's commentaries about the cheapness of human life, as well as one about corruption (a criminal who's the suspect in over 30 cop deaths being allowed out of jail in 24 hours?!) *****SPOILERS***** It's not ironic that there wasn't any backup when Murphy and Lewis confronted Clarence Bodicker's (sp) violent gang, but there was an army of cops readily available after Dick Jones called for help when Robo and the larger robot were trashing through his office. Why wasn't that army of cops available to take down Bodicker's gang, one asks? For same reason as above with the faulty body armor, where the hope is that cops will quit their post if they perceive it to be too dangerous and OCP will be granted absolute power by a scared population that *thinks* the company is looking out for the masses. Though, I must say, the one bit is when Murphy and Lewis decide to go after a gang of 8 violent robbers when they're told there's no back-up? I think NOT. There's brave and then there's stupid, and that kind of behavior is crossing the line towards the latter."

Of course, being only 10 at the time, and brought up on a TV diet of kids cartoons, I was completely traumatised by the experience. This lead to months of nightmares about people dissolving in toxic waste, and me becoming terrified of the twitchy microwave in our kitchen. Thanks Teach!! Anyway, Now I am 35, completely desensitised to violence in films and I stumbled across this on Netflix and decided to watch it again with adult perspective, to see if I really hated it as much as I thought I did. It is as gory as I remember so anyone looking for lots of blood, squishy corpses and explosions, this is the film for you! It hasn't aged well, but some of the effects are still decent. It is fun to revisit the 80s and all that 80's cheesy dialogue, obsolete technology and ridiculous bad guys, complete with a greedy, evil corporation running the show. Definitely worth a watch if you are into this genre. I'll be interested to see how the remake turns out." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "1987 was a significant year for action, sci-fi, and horror films, and on-screen violence conveyed as shocking, grotesque imagery moved many members of a more juvenile audience that year and more to follow. Paul Verhoven's \"Robocop\" is a perfect example of an excessively violent comic book sci-fi fantasy box office smash. Its a film that engraved itself into the consciousnesses of minds such as my own with a very modern interpretation of villains and archetypal heroes, good versus evil, and science versus humanity. Peter Weller is perfectly cast as good-hearted policeman, Alex Murphy, newly transferred to a futuristic Detroit where corporations rule, and crime has taken its toll. After he is cut down by ruthless bad guys, Murphy undergoes a transformation into a cybernetic super-cop equipped with the latest and greatest of futuristic technology, and must eventually take revenge against the gangsters that took away his human identity and confront his adversaries protected by the corporate hierarchy. Verhoven's vision is one of sheer brilliance, unexpectedly utilizing extreme violence to depict a world of viciousness and moral desensitization. Murphy's horrifying murder is so graphic, that it only sets the stage for his later exercises in revenge and retribution. The cast is absolutely top-notch, with Nancy Allen as Murphy's tough but caring partner, Ronny Cox as a white collar shark businessman, Miguel Ferrer as an amoral and ambitious executive, and Kurtwood Smith who steals the show as one of the most detestably amusing villains in modern movie history, Clarence Boddicker. Superb directorial touches include excellent point-of-view camera work, hilarious spoof-style in-movie commercials and news reels, and plenty of twisted dialog and comic relief. Weller's performance provides the man versus machine human story and the ED-209 prototype (although stop-motion FX seem dated), is a blast. \"Robocop\" is a solid example of a coming of age tale of brutality and bloodshed, giving audiences of the extreme action genre exactly what it came for with plenty of surprises and no-holds-barred thrills. With all the computer graphics and 3D enhancements of today, they just don't make them like this anymore, and when Robo unleashes his fury on old Detroit, you'll buy that for a dollar! The unrated Director's cut is the way to go, with the extended Murphy killing (complete with rotating camera head shot). Verhoven will go on to direct \"Total Recall\" and \"Basic Instinct\" and Peter Weller and the surviving cast will return for an entertaining sequel, \"Robocop 2\"." "The 1980's were and are a treasure trove for action movie lovers who were blessed with an abundance of classic action tales ranging from Terminator, Lethal Weapon, Die Hard and countless other flicks that looked to take names and ask questions later. Dutch wild child Paul Verhoeven's 1987 bout of robotic justice can sit proudly alongside those classic entries as a shamelessly fun and over the top piece of blood infused entertainment. For some unbeknown reason I have in my many years of film watching never seen Peter Weller strut his stuff as Alex Murphy a man who becomes our titular Robocop (a fact made all the more shameful on my behalf considering I was holed up working in a video store for more than 5 years) but I am glad I have now rectified that problem. Robocop is a film filled with subtle smarts and ingenious ideas that were fantastically realised by Verhoeven with some ripping makeup design and typically brutal 1980's action scenes littering the picture. There is an air of fun and playfulness throughout the picture that are all infrequent in today's action films with Robocop not afraid to lighten the mood along with mixing in themes that are more meaningful and heartfelt, a mood that is heightened by a cast full of colourful and committed actors. Peter Weller in the role he will always be remembered for is great as our hero Murphy, playing the man and machine with an always calm yet readily menacing presence. As he quips his way through the movie we are always on his side and that's without the film bothering with much exposition at all. Other actors in the piece from Nancy Allen's female cop Anne and Kurtwood Smith's downright slimy Clarence J. Boddicker. All make their characters there's which fits in fantastically with Verhoeven's at times ingenious direction. When you watch Robocop today you really get the sense that even though it has now happened a remake/reboot is entirely unnecessary with the original still standing up in today's standards and still packing both a punch in the entertainment and social commentary stakes. If you're thinking about going to see the new Robocop why not just watch the original instead? As they say the original is always the best. 4 steps out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com" "When I look at the modern day West, and the 2008 financial crisis, I often see parallels with images from RoboCop: protests, mind-numbing commercials, crime as the result of huge poverty, profit as the main goal of life, no matter at what (or whose) expense. There is not one OCP today, but dozens of OCPs, huge modern mega-corporations that influence every aspect of the society and drain it of its wealth. Just like in RoboCop, the middle class is almost gone and we only have the poor and the rich. RoboCop started out as a pure B-movie, but unlike Cyborg (1989) or The Six Million Dolar Man (1974), it kept its relevance, satire and sharpness precisely because it is so close to today that it hurts. Even as a kid, I somehow got that one of the messages of the film was how the power was slowly shifting from the government to the OCP. Let's be fair, though, Verhoeven sometimes directs a scene in a heavy, clumsy manner, and some cheap ideas slightly reduce my enjoyment whenever I re-watch this. Overall, this is still a strong film, and I stand behind what I say. Kurtwood Smith is one of the most fiendish villains of the 80s, and one of the most unorthodox ones, too, with those glasses, but we must also mention Peter Weller who is often overlooked under that armor, yet his stoic presence tells us everything we need to know. His Murphy is a character designed by the corporations, a being that is a product, not a being anymore. The way he finds his humanity, nonetheless, is still powerful. He defies the system, he defies the cold exploitation - and he becomes worthy to become recognized. And the ED-something-something robot is still cool as ever, too." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "For starters Robocop is an underrated and misunderstood movie by many. Yet if you watch this movie and see passed the dark sense of humour and ultra violence there is a story which is reflective of our world today. Robocop is a satire and a well thought out one at that. OCP represent the big corporations, Robocop/Murphy represents the human spirit and this is the irony of the movie that despite Murphy becoming almost entirely machine by the company they could not destroy his human side. Murphy did not become a mindless, emotionless product that is Robocop!! His human emotional side was still too strong and Murphy's emotional journey as Robocop and losing his contact with his family give this movie depth which makes the original movie vastly superior to the hollow sequels that followed. So the analogy here is business, power, money and technology attempt to dehumanise mankind but showing that eventually human spirit will win the day and essentially this aspect is most important in life. An increasing focus in today's society I believe. In the final sequence of the movie this is emphasised by the Old Man asking Robocop what his name is, to which he replies 'Murphy'!. He was no longer the machine he was Alex Murphy the man! OK so I have now analysised this movie at its core but on a more superficial level this movie is fantastic action flick with humour added in bundles. It has some very violent scene which will stick in the memory especially the murder of Murphy. The Robocop suit special effects are brilliant, with his machine pistol style handgun being iconic and symbolic of the Robocop character. The acting is very solid and believable. The stop motion effects of ED-209 are probably not up to today's standards but in my eyes give the movie an authentic 80's feel and add to its charm. The action sequences are all great and no shot in the movie is wasted and all of it is relevant. The adverts in the movie and news sequences also adds to the satirical value of the movie and give the movie a dark humour. This is a movie I would recommend to all sci-fi and action fans but I warn you this is not a movie for the faint hearted as it contains uncompromising violence and lots of foul language. Most importantly though this is a movie that has more depth than meets the eye and is really giving a message to the more observant viewer but can also cater for the more shallow movie watcher. This is a shame because Robocop is much more than guns, blood and bad language. Its a satire of the modern world and I highly recommend it!!" "Every now and then a film comes out with so much action and mayhem, that an audience member cannot tell weather they were anesthetized from the drama or made to feel numb from the killings and body count. I saw this film in the surround-sound theater and the explosions and gunfire sent me into a tail-spin. It was a good action film, but the level of ambivalent destruction reached a peak when one of the characters spoke of the deceased as a 'product' and not as a human being. The tale of \"Robo-Cop\" begins when our hero Officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) signs up to be a candidate for the Robo-cop project. A gang of vicious thugs, headed by Clarece Boddicker, (Kurtwood Smith) are on a murderous rampage through 'old Detroit' and have little compunction to kill police at every opportunity. One such opportunity occurs when Officer Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen) accidentally allows her partner to be gun-down and left for dead. Thus initiating the transformation from ordinary cop to Law Enforcement Robot, created by O.C.P. headed by none other than Dan O'Herlihy as President. Ronny Cox is superb as Dick Jones, VP. at O.C.P. But he is about to be rivaled by up and coming Bob Morton. (Miguel Ferrer) Great film. ****" "Quick, what do Peter Weller, Ray Wise, and Paul McCrane have in common? If you say they were all in RoboCop, you're all halfway there. What they also have in common was they all were in Day 5 of \"24\" (with McCrane's role partly expanded to Day 6). Besides those names other familiar faces include Ronny Cox (Beverly Hills Cop series), Nancy Allen (ex-husband Brian De Palma movies, I Wanna Hold Your Hand), Miguel Ferrer (\"Twin Peaks\"), and, in the movie's best role, Kurtwood Smith (\"That '70s Show\") as the main villain, Clarence Boddicker. While partially predictable, RoboCop has some of the most badass action in movie history with wonderful humorous touches throughout. Director Paul Verhoeven really keeps a constant pace during the chase scenes. Check out Leeza Gibbons as one of the news anchors in the TV clip sequences. This movie is most highly recommended." "Paul Verhoeven's \"Robocop\" looks and sounds a lot like James Cameron's \"The Terminator\" (1984) on initial glance, with a mechanized, half-man/half-machine creation placed inside an ultra-violent action plot. The key difference is: whereas Cameron doesn't have a satirical bone in his body, Dutch director Verhoeven does, and transforms \"Robocop\" into a fine-tuned blend of futurist comedy and riveting action violence. Detroit cop Murphy (Peter Weller) is ambushed and brutally executed by a gang of thugs (headed by Kurtwood Smith!); left for dead, he is seized upon by a corporate creep (Miguel Ferrer, patenting his sleazy screen persona) who transforms him into the titular character--a seemingly perfect and unstoppable crime-fighting machine. It goes without saying that there are more than a few complications, and when Robocop suffers flashbacks of Murphy's death, his world is turned upside-down. Verhoeven's sense of frenetic action direction is matched by the incisive satire of corporate politics, where money-hungry vultures like Ferrer and Ronny Cox subsidize gangsters and drug manufacturers; similarly, the vision of future-media (while outdated with its distinctly '80s fonts and graphics) possesses a sarcastic, desensitized attitude that is ironically fitting (the malfunction of a satellite that laser-fries 100 from space is shrugged off as no big deal)...and could there be a bit of foreshadowing to our SUV-obsessed populace that the car everyone wants is an SUX 6000? It may look like a conventional sci-fi/action flick on the surface, but \"Robocop\" has an intellectual pulse that makes its thrills all the more satisfying." "This is a very good film. It was excellent in the 80s, and it's excellent today. It ages so very well. Satirical, bathetic, funny, heroic, worrying, sharp... it goes on and on. Maybe in a few more years, this film will be viewed with increasing amazement, at being so very prophetic.... and salutary. The music is good, too. You probably don't notice it with first viewing, but later, you do. All the acting performances are good, and in later years we saw some of the actors reappear in prominent roles, but they never rang true as they were all bad baddies in Robocop. The only problem is that Weller has to go around for most of it with his face mostly covered. Such a waste. stay out of TROUBLE." "Law enforcement is a dangerous job for all police at the best of times. That is no more apparent than in the 1987 science-fiction movie, Robocop. After seeing this movie a few times I appreciate what it must be like to be a cop and what it is like to be the target of criminals, and at the mercy of the public they are protecting. Robocop allows us to see first-hand what it means to have your life 'robbed' away from you, then what it takes to right the wrong that has been committed. When a good cop, Alex Murphy, gets blown away by some ruthless criminals, innovative scientists and doctors are able to piece him back together as an unstoppable crime-fighting cyborg called 'Robocop'. Impervious to bullets and bombs, and equipped to with high-tech weaponry, Robocop quickly makes a name for himself by cleaning up the crime-ridden streets of violence-ravaged Detroit. But despite his new, hardened exterior, Robocop is tormented by scraps of memory of his former life, and relives vivid nightmares of his own death at the hands of the vicious killers. Now he is out to seek more than justice.he wants revenge! I am fascinated by Robocop director Paul Verhoeven. His direction style is pretty good, with his most famous work being Basic Instinct, a movie I did like. I am sure that this movie took along time to direct, and I also know that Verhoeven was very 'hands-on' directing it. However he has a very weird mind, especially with his obsession about the crucifix. In Robocop, Verhoeven said 'I wanted to show Satan killing Jesus', in reference to the character of Alex Murphy. I question this man's morals and values, as they are very confronting. His fascination with violence is also a very hard thing to understand. The other people involved in making 'Robocop' were screenwriters Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner, who wrote a wonderful script for this movie. The hero of the film was especially well written. The people who were involved in making the 'Robocop' suit, had an arduous task, but did it beautifully. The suit was designed by Rob Bottin. I am sure he would have had to put a lot of thought into what and how the suit would be like. Actor Peter Weller had the difficult, but enviable task of being Police Officer Alex Murphy/Robocop. I feel that he was a great choice for being 'the knight in shining armor'. The way he makes us believe that he is a robot is terrific, as is the way that he brings a human side to his other personality. I recently saw Weller in the movie 'Styx', starring alongside Aussie actor Bryan Brown. 'Robo's' partner is female cop Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen). Her character remains loyal to Robocop, because when other people believe Alex Murphy is 'dead', Lewis knows her old partner is inside that machine somewhere. There are some really bad characters in Robocop. Robert 'Bob' Morton (Miguel Ferrier) would seem to be on the side of good, as he is the one responsible for making 'a man become a robot'. However it also evident that he is only doing it for his own gain. The meanest character on this film was a man by the name of Clarence Boddicker, (Kurtwood Smith). His character has no conscience, as he goes around Detroit killing innocent cops without blinking an eye. He is doing this under the evil instructions of OCP employee Richard 'Dick' Jones (Ronny Cox). By the end of the movie you are willing that Dick and the bad guy are blown away by Robocop. I would describe the scenes to this movie as being either 'gruesome or heroic'. Alex Murphy's death is one of the most challenging pieces of cinema I have ever seen, as was the introduction of Police robot 'Ed 209'. When Ed goes haywire, killing an innocent man, once again the violence is very confronting for the audience. This scene also shows the subtle use of comedy. After shutting down the robot, a person calls out for a 'paramedic' to help the dead man. This was very humorous, as the man was more than just 'dead', and makes what was something so violent seem to be just a joke. By the end this movie, I felt very desensitised by the violence, as if it were commonplace. This movie also has some heroic scenes. All of the screen time with Robocop seemed to make him feel like a hero, as we are all willing him to do his job, by being a tough indestructible police officer. My favourite two 'Robo-scenes' are one, when Robocop confronts one of his killers at a 'Shell' gas station, and two, when our hero uncovers a major drug raid, again involving the scum that ended Alex Murphy. I also like the soundtrack to 'Robocop'. The Robocop 'march' highlights the status of our hero and these scenes. Yet we are also made to feel for this cyborg. I like how we see him revisit his former home, and what affect his 'human brain' has. This robot is still very vulnerable and disturbed by what has happened to him in the past as a human. It is a known fact that people hated working on this movie, which is understandable. I am sure it would have been demanding, on and off screen. Peter Weller also openly admitted that being 'Robocop' was the worst experience of his acting life, simply because of the costume that he had to wear. I was not surprised to hear that. Yet he gave the Robocop figure great 'heart' which it needed. This movie will test your threshold for violence, as it is 'cynical and unblinking'. It will also make you feel good, as the main star is a 'likeable' robot. Watch out for the wonderful DVD which is now available for this movie. For an 80's movie, Robocop was a very good one.

"Sharp, ultra-violent (particularly the director's cut) and undeniably funny (if you're into this kind of) action/science fiction set in a not too distant Detroit, Michigan future (though actually filmed in Houstan, Texas) where crime runs rampant and people sell out regularly for the sake of the all mighty dollar. One particularly annoying criminal is Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith, who later went on to play the cranky dad Red Foreman on TV's \"That 70s Show\") a sadistic drug dealer who secretly works for OCP (Omni-Consumer Products) 2nd in command Dick Jones (Ronny Cox). Jones tries to sell a new state of the art security robot called ED-209 (Enforcement Droid), but ED malfunctions and kills a young executive during demonstration so the Old Man/OCP President (Daniel O'Herlihy) gives the green light to up and comer Bob Morton's (a much younger Miguel Ferrer who actually has hair) ROBOCOP program, which is supposed to blend a dead policeman's flesh and experience with those of a machine. Later that day, family man Police Offer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is brutally mutilated by Clarence and his gang of sadistic scum-bags, much to the horror of his lady partner Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen). Murphy is then resurrected with a blanked memory as Robocop, a hulking, 6-foot tall cyborg, heavily armored and wielding a big gun. After being unveiled and thwarting a machine gun toting convenience store robber (who tries to pick up an Iron Man comic book along with the robbery), shooting a rapist in the balls and throwing a blood thirsty ex-city councilman out of a window thus saving the mayor, Robocop becomes a sensation and security factor in securing revitalizing Old Detroit as part of a big city project (Delta City or something). This angers Jones and he swears revenge on Morton. Later Robocop (who only Lewis recognizes as Murphy) has a dream/flashback to his brutal murder which freaks out his personal technicians before he goes off for his nightly patrol. While out on patrol he encounters Emil (Paul McCrane), one of Clarence's thugs while he's robbing and terrorizing a gas station attendant and, after a voice from beyond the grave moment, the gas station is blown sky high and Robocop shoots down Emil's bike, demanding his identity. Later Robocop checks out Emil and his known accomplices, which leads to him coming across Clarence and one of his murdered victims, Alex Murphy. After Robocop goes back to his old home and regains enough memories of his previous life to realize that HE IS Murphy, he becomes enraged and hellbent on beating the crap out of Clarence and his minions any which way he can. The only thing standing in his way are his prime directives - 1) Serve the public trust, 2) Protect the Innocent, 3) Uphold the law and \"Directive 4\" (no attackng senior OCP staff members), OCP man Jones and ED-209. Did I mention that the other cops are trying to go on strike? Naturally, since this is a feel good 80s movie, Robocop naturally triumphs over evil and destroys Clarence and his minions. Peter Weller is mesmerizing as Robocop, Kurtwood Smith is a threatening villain (my ability to enjoy this film has been hampered somewhat by Smith's role on \"That 70s Show\") and Jones is a charming villain. Nancy Allen does capable work as Lewis. Sadly, what could have been a great franchise was ruined by kid oriented toy marketing, \"Robocop 2\", which had a plot that just didn't go anywhere, the unnecessary presence of a sadistic, foul mouthed boy who we're expected to feel sorry for when he dies and an obnoxious, manipulative conniving little bitch who doesn't get her just desserts played by Belinda Bauer (who's only acting ability IS conniving little bitch) and \"Robocop 3\" which turned Robocop into a joke and didn't even feature Peter Weller as Robocop. At least \"Robocop 2\" had some cool action scenes and cool music Leonard Rosenbaum (or Rosenman, I forget how you spell his name). Still, \"Robocop 1\" is a classic of the action/science fiction genre and features numerous memorable pot shots at capitalism run rampant along with the whole humanity VS technology thing and when it stops being a machine and becomes a person. Music by Basil Pouldouris, who also did the music for \"Conan the Barbarian\". Stand out stop motion special effects by Phil Tippet." "Robocop along with Lethal Weapon and Predator were the three action films of 1987. Robocop is about a law officer(peter weller) who is killed on the line of duty and is resurrected by a greedy company called OCP(omni consumer products)and the man responsible is Bob(Miguel Ferrer) who is being challanged by Dick Jones(Ronny Cox) with the same idea but different structures. Dick has his own design called Ed-209, a 10 foot robot with cannons the size of gas tanks for pick up trucks. With Robocop in action, the city is safe, until his past as a human gets him to get even with the people that kill him. great action movie with funny dialogue and humor along the way, Robocop proves to be one of the greatest action movies ever made." "Paul Verhoven, who originally turned this project down, must have known what a big joke this film was going to be if made right. But exactly right is how he's made it, as it's the kind of joke that one wants to get told by someone who knows how to tell it, so that one can remember how it goes to tell the next guy. It lays in its satire in sharp stabs that are wickedly dead-on, as far as consumerism and living in a state of decay by the media and complete omniscient (and sinister in playing both sides) corporate control goes, with commercials for 'Nukem', a variation on battleship, and a dinosaur-attacking-a-city movie coming soon, which comes at the strangest of time in the story. In fact, RoboCop in a big way can be seen as the older cousin of Starship Troopers, and to a smaller extent Total Recall, Verhoven's other futuristic sci-fi ventures: the society itself, which is encompassed with authorities, the corporate interests, the criminals, the cops with their low morale and high body count (cops deaths, not criminals), lends itself to being led on to get dominated by technology. What RoboCop brilliantly posits is that when the human element is suppressed in a society driven head-on by mindless and lethal technology, it's bound to come out somehow in some form. Just so happens Murphy (Peter Weller) is that form. The simple lowdown: Murphy and his female cop partner are out chasing some bad guys, they track them down to a warehouse where Murphy is captured, shot repeatedly (his hand gets shot off first, then past the bullet proof vest), and killed...Or so it seems, as he's not totally dead, and is brought back to life, though not really. In a series of first-person perspectives- a real inventive way to show passage of time as well as a level of cynical manipulation in the guise of wild progress in making a human-robot- we see Murphy turned into Robocop, his arms replaced, a gridding and shooting system loaded in, and finally taking his first steps. Like any superhero, RoboCop is a kick-ass force to be reckoned with, and completely objective: he's there to serve and protect, and make the occasional PA for kids, \"Stay out of trouble.\" The same thugs from before however are still lurking around, and a run-in with one stirs memories, if not exactly feelings, of Murphy's demise, as well as the loss he feels for his wife and child. Little by little, a routine investigation/crackdown by Robocop turns into a sort of vendetta. This, unfortunately, stirs up wrath in the head of the OCP, who is, as luck would have it, also the boss of the big-hoodlums Robocop is after in Detroit's glummest of slums. It's worth to point out some of these story points, as Verhoven and the writers are actually very strong on pushing forward the story, but in a level that makes material that should be in a 25 cent pulpy comic book from the 50s into something more tangible. Like the Terminator, Verhoven keeps the adrenaline going forward as far as directing the action set-pieces, from small scenes with liquor store robberies, to a big crackdown of Clarence's drug operation, and to a scene involving many, many, many guns firing on Robocop in one fell swoop. But there's often an attitude to action, specifically the \"excessive violence\" (as the MPAA put it when it gave the film an X at first sight), that reminds the audience that it's bigger than life, like a movie should be like this, and at the same time graphic enough to point out the very chaotic nature of gang warfare. It's a thin line that Verhoven and his collaborators walk on and pull off tremendously, in making scenes that should be horribly horrific, like when the big walker-gun-machine is introduced and kills one of the board members, hilarious in the darkest possible way in how they unfold, and at the same time keep excitement to it, of the kind of danger one saw in Death Wish (and, like that film, Detroit's crime scene is probably not far from the one depicted here). And when it comes down to it too, RoboCop/Murphy is the kind of big-screen hero that audiences can get behind, if after a slight adjustment to the whole goof that comes in just picturing a Robocop before it comes on screen. There's tragedy inherent to Murphy's original demise, hence the sort of bitter edge of the first-person creation scenes, especially because Robocop's creators didn't work out making it a figure that is entirely robot. Programming stays the same, but the past ends up informing the character, and brings what is otherwise a walking bill-of-rights machine with a big (bleeping) gun to being human again, in its black-and-white manner. In his own kind of twisted way, this is for Verhoven what Brazil is for Terry Gilliam; a near-future plausible not for the advances in technology (or lack thereof), but because of human beings not being able to know how to function society, and what a consciousness in technology brings to the situation. This as well as each director's obsessions, in this case Verhoven's knack at shameless artifice, bigger than life bad guys, twists in the plot, and a lot of bombastic violence. And all the same, it's an rip-roaring adult popcorn movie, one of the best of 1987." "Remember watching this movie as a schoolboy at home on small TV screen from an old VHS-player. Through a very small TV-set, with crappy sound, and crappy picture. But it still blew me away. The story, the settings, the special effects, the dramatic events, the gloomy violence, and insane breaking of the law did not let my mind go from the first frames till the very last. There was information once in our Soviet magazines that the movie had been originally shown in the USA to people of 21 and older only. Wow! And the movie does not have any serious sexual material. A darn good movie. A sci-fi of the first rate. A classic. A little picture that changed my attitude to sci-fi action genre forever. \"The Terminator\", \"Predator\", \"RoboCop\", and a few others are really the iron fist of the genre. The biggest achievement of the American culture. Guess what? Yes, 10 out of 10. Sequels do not matter, but the original does big time. Thank you for attention." "Since I was born in the late seventies, I missed a lot of classic movies as a kid and in the eighties there just weren't made that many excellent movies. But if you ask me to name on of the movies that I saw then and which I still like, than chances are that it will be this \"Robocop\". It looked great back then, but still hasn't lost any of its power today. In a futuristic Detroit, violence is everywhere. The police department isn't able to react in a proper way and every week several officers get killed in the line of duty. But a private company called OPC may have come up with an excellent alternative for a police officer. They have developed E.D. 209, a powerful and huge crime fighting robot that can be used 24 hours a day. The only problem is that the robot doesn't always do its task correctly and sometimes shoots an innocent man. So it isn't used and the human cops will have to keep doing the dirty work. While Officer Alex J. Murphy goes on his first patrol, he is ambushed and shot by the feared gang leader and cop killer Clarence Boddicker. In the hospital they try to save Murphy's life, but when that appears to be impossible, his body is used by OPC to develop an entirely new robot. They use him to create the much better RoboCop. He is very successful against criminals, but when memories of his former life begin to surface, he starts looking for revenge... I guess that many people who now see this movie for the first time might say that some special effects could have been better. Especially the scenes with the E.D. 209 don't always look perfect (as long as it stands still, it all looks OK, but when it moves you see that the special effects weren't what they are today). Personally I didn't really have any problem with that because I kept in mind that this is still a movie from 1987. Let's be honest, in 20 years time today's special effects will probably look dated as well. But a good thing about this movie is that it didn't just rely on its special effects. The story is more than OK, and even though written almost two decades ago, still looks futuristic enough to be believable. A good thing about the story is also the fact that they don't mention a date. Some eighties Sci-Fi movies say: 'in the year 2002...' Back then that may have felt futuristic, special and believable, but when you see it today, you know that it wasn't like that at all in 2002. But what would a good story be without some good directing and acting? Absolutely nothing. It wouldn't be the first movie to fail completely because one of those things wasn't exactly great. But not in this case: Paul Verhoeven established his name in Hollywood with this movie (which is completely understandable, although he never came up with another movie that great.) and actors like Peter Weller and Nancy Allen also did a very good job (although they too weren't able to come up with another excellent project). In the end this is a Sci-Fi / action movie that really stands out above the average movie in the genre. Normally I'm not a fan of this kind of movies, but this time I'm willing to make an exception. The acting and the directing were very good, the story still feels futuristic enough and believable... That's why I give this movie a 7.5/10." "Robocop (1987) *** (out of 4) This extremely entertaining and original action picture was a box-office hit when first released even though the controversy of its violence would cause a firestorm even after the MPAA took out several seconds of footage. The film takes place in a crime filled Detroit where various psychopaths are killing cops at an alarming rate. One mastermind (Kurtwood Smith) has killed over two dozen cops and adds Murphy (Peter Weller) to his life. A local company, building for the future, takes what's left of Murphy and turns him into the machine Robocop. What they don't expect is for the robot to have memories of his human life and soon he sets out for revenge. I think the reason this movie grabbed crowds in 1987 and remains so fresh today is that the screenplay really went for broke and tried to mix everything it could. Not only is it sci-fi and action but we also get a lot of nice humor scattered throughout the ultra-violence and gore soaked story. It also helps that the screenplay was smart enough to make sure it builds up our human cop to where we care for him and want to see him get his revenge. It also helps that the bad guys here are among the greatest scum ever gathered in a movie. Smith is downright masterful as the head psycho and you can't help but want to see this guy beaten to a bloody pulp and the same holds true for his supporting cast. Weller is very good in his role as both the human cop as well as the machine. Nancy Allen also adds nice support even though her role isn't all that big. Verhoeven does a terrific job at building up this futuristic setting but he also manages to make it quite dark and moody. I think people forget what a great director he can be and he really puts his mark on this film and especially with the graphic violence. Seeing this thing in its R-rated form is certainly not the way too go even if you can't stomach the strong violence." "This is the original Robocop movie. It is still a very good movie, and it is much better than the new version. Many years have past since this came out, and it still deserves to be in the top. Many of the new versions of old movies that come out is missing some of the good feeling due to so much special effects, but they are not always needed to be a great movie. All is there. Action, Sorrow and the thoughts afterwords. The story is great and still and perhaps it is not so long in the future that we have these robot cops. The movie is about the police officer Alex Murphy, who somehow turned out to be a robot cop. He struggles with his past and present and the movie is really thoughtful these days were robots turn up everywhere. The special effects are not that good but when you think of when the movie was made it is no problem and the story makes you to forget all of that. Do not miss it." "My reasons to love Robocop : 1 - The interesting argument , savage capitalism , the high crime of a futuristic city ; corporate corruption , privatization, the struggle of good against evil, greed, technology development , cruel villains , the hero, the police loyalty, social criticism , and light humor. 2 - The impeccable direction of Paul Verhoeven . 3 - The excellent performances from the entire cast . 4 - The wonderful special effects , effective cinematography, beautiful music by Basil Poledouris ; and great editing . 5 - The spectacular action sequences, graphic violence , and brutal death scenes . 6 - A police flesh is killed, loses his family , then the hero is resurrected , his body is steel, and the new hero fights against the worst of society, throughout the process the hero has a new identity in the film takes the theme of revenge and amnesia. 7- Brain-computer interfacing in fiction. Robocop is a perfect action film and science fiction." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Unfortunately, for me, I didn't first get involved with the lovable Robocop until part 2 came out in 1990. Since I was a kid then, and trying to watch as many movies as I possibly could at that age, I had a good time with Robocop 2. Now, I think I've seen it only once since 1990 and not again in over two decades, so we'll see when I revisit that movie. I digress. Speaking about Robocop, the original  and not the not-anticipated-by-me remake in 2014, I was way too young to see this when it came out in theatres. Oh, and I was banned for most Rated-R flicks, unless my parents just had to see a Rated-R film and they had no babysitter. When I finally did, of course, I fell in love with it. It was the perfect 1980s action movie  make that, superhero movie. Yeah, Robocop is a superhero and the movie had all the eight stereotypical qualities of one: 1. Introduce a peaceful do-gooder and abruptly (and literally) shoot him down. 2. Reintroduce him with special powers. 3. Show just a handful of \"saving the public\" examples. 4. Our hero learns more about himself while inadvertently, inventing a smart, wealthy and obviously evil nemesis to take down our hero. 5. Shoot the hero down, again. 6. Show examples of the evil nemesis's, ah-hem, evilness. 7. Have hero learn and regain confidence...and muscle. 8. A SUPERHERO is born and comes back with a vengeance in the climax. Now, technically, I didn't spoil anything there. This is literally the formula for most superhero movies, including one of my all-time superhero movies, 1978's Superman: The Movie. Oh, and this movie is now 26 years old. Get with it, if you haven't seen it! Generally, in my reviews, I cover the synopsis. Since, I did above, I can move on. I truly loved this movie. It never seems to age for me whenever I revisit it. Sure, there's a few 80s technology/animation  mostly by ED-209  that I can't get past and no remake next year will make me side with them to correct any budget issues here. The lines were great, the action (ah-hem) explosive, the comedy funny, the heart attached and it truly defined that era of films. This movie, if it has to be remade, which it doesn't, deserves better follow-ups. The sequels  now thinking back on them  were comical and the TV seriesI didn't even bother. After seeing the trailer for the 2014 remake (not reboot, because, likely, it'll go nowhere or make that much,) I'm not enthused. But, sticking with this Robocop, it'll be a classic to the end of days. Side Note: My headline reads: Robopop. The reason? When I was young, and we had one TV with limited channels  never had cable until I moved out and there was this Bob Hope special on where in one segment, he dressed as Robocop, but was these kid's Robopop. I thought that was the funniest thing at the time and it's stuck with me since. Perhaps, I should YouTube that to see if someone else agrees with me Side Note II: Okay, not on YouTube, or Google But, I'll always have that memory. Ahhh, the past." "I thought this movie would be a stinker. It reminded me of Blade Runner and contrary to most people, I didn't like that movie too much. So I was skeptical about seeing this. However, that skepticism didn't last long. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie. This movie is about a young cop who was brutally murdered. He is resurrected as part human, part robot. In his new life, he goes after the people who murdered him. The acting is very good. I enjoyed the performances by Peter Weller, Ronny Cox, and Miguel Ferrier. Overall, this is an enjoyable action/sci-fi movie. This movie is very violent though. I rate this film 8/10."

"*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "When I was a kid, the word \"Robocop\" would bring into mind a silly robot policeman who talked funny (thanks Robocop 3). When I grew older,I saw the first \"Robocop\" and all I could say that I was blown away just like Peter Weller's Hand. I never thought that a movie about a very cartoonish-looking character could be so vicious and brutal. Peter Weller's mutilation was disturbing and his revenge as Robocop provide equally stomach-churning tableaux of undiluted nastiness. Aside from the gruesome set pieces, we are also treated to violent gun battles punctuated by bloody arterial sprays from each unlucky victim. But \"Robocop\" does't only exist to show us a human hand being blasted in graphic detail by a shotgun, it also serves as a biting, funny social commentary on how consumerism and capitalism have morally downgraded our society. This is evident in the \"infomercials\" that pop out of the film from time to time, which advertises bizarre and violent entertainment for the enjoyment of the entire family.(like that nuclear war game) what's good is that Verhoeven actually maintains the films unique mood throughout the film. The combination of violent splatter and social commentary is evident when the dumb robot, the ED-209, splatters an executive all over the place. The old man's( Dan O'Herlihy) response? \"Dick, I'm very disappointed.\" Films like this not only entertains us with violent action, it also takes its time to make us laugh as society spirals downward. ROBOCOP FOR TOP 250!!!" "Yes, the guy who did this movie would later make Starship Troopers, here though I think is a more realistic take on a future society. A rather violent society, a place where the average cop just is not enough so they try to make a super cop. First, they try a totally robotic one with very deadly yet somehow darkly comic results. Since this one fails another person gets to try it his way and they make this robotic cop using the remains of an officer who is simply gunned down in a most brutal and unpleasant way. So the officer goes out on his beat and takes out criminals very effectively albeit a bit emotionless. His former partner though jogs his memory and all hell breaks loose at a factory where we have a very cool fight that even involves a dude getting toxic waste on himself. Then you have a conclusion that while not as great as the factory fight is still rather cool and a bit funny as well. So there you have it, Peter Weller does a rather good job as Robocop, Nancy Allen is okay too, but nothing special. Good villains too, but I can not really say if I remember seeing them in other movies other than Ronny Cox as if has been awhile since I have seen this movie. Though as a kid I thought this movie was the bomb as I saw it at the theater. Did not care for the fake commercials in it though." "Usually I don't like thin, action movies. However, RoboCop is far from thin. The plot here is actually quite complex. In the near future, Detroit is a city packed with crime, and the normal police aren't enough to stop it. The police force is bought out by a big corporation, Omni Consumer Products (O.C.P.), and they have new plans for the police force to stop the crime. Their answer? RoboCop. The performances here were excellent. Peter Weller was entertaining as Officer Murphy (RoboCop). Nancy Allen was good as Officer Lewis, Murphy's partner. Dan O'Herlihy was perfect as The Old Man, the owner of OCP. Ronny Cox was good as Dick Jones, the #2 person of OCP. Miguel Ferrer was great as Bob Morton, the OCP executive who creates RoboCop. And Kurtwood Smith was great as Clarence Boddicker, the unofficial \"crime boss' of Old Detroit. Besides great acting, there are great effects, costumes and props. Making this movie much MUCH more than a thin, no-plot action movie. RoboCop is very entertaining and should appeal to nearly all audiences. 9/10." "RoboCop was one of the first R rated movies I ever saw as a child. Back when they had this allure of being forbidden and dangerous. I'll freely admit I was much too young to catch its satire and a lot of the plot points flew right over my head. I was more affected (and to a degree traumatized) by its graphic violence and the horrible circumstances of Murphy's fate. But the film stuck with me. It was such a compelling character surrounded by equally interesting supporting characters. The villain gave me nightmares and I was flat out terrified of him. It was also one of the first movies with morally ambiguous individuals I'd ever seen. Until then the good guys were good and the bad guys were bad. But it wasn't that simple in RoboCop. And even at that young age that resonated with me. As I got older I began to appreciate the film on entirely other levels. And now, at 25 I love it even more. What we have here is something that could easily have turned into straight to video silliness. A mediocre script and laughable concept made into something revolutionary by great film-making. The lower points on Paul Verhoeven's resume can be forgiven because of gems like this. So many of the sequences in this film are just brilliantly shot and conceived (Murphy's death, the slow introduction to RoboCop, the Rock Shop bust, and the entire third act). He took subpar material and managed to shape it into so much more. But Verhoeven doesn't deserve all the credit. Peter Weller's performance is suitabaly repressed but somehow still so emotive. Not an easy task when all the audience sees is the lower half of your face. Kurtwood Smith takes corny and clichéd dialogue and makes it haunting and believable. The film has a down and dirty tone that no subsequent versions of the franchise have ever matched. There's beauty in its brutality and a cohesiveness sorely missing in the sequels. It feels epic and intimate at the same time. It's imaginative and awe inspiring. There were so many places to go with this character and so many possibilities. It's a shame the films and TV series that followed wasted all of them. Now the franchise inspires laughs and is all but dead. It's too bad because it's easy to forget how powerful and truly rock solid this first entry is." "In the near future of Detroit City. The major corporation \"OCP\" wants to built an Cyborg by making the perfect futuristic Police Officer. One day, Police Officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is killed on the line of duty by an ruthless gang of murdering/thieves (Lead by Kurtwood Smith). The \"OCP\" finds the perfect candidate by using several body parts of Murphy of their division. When \"OCP\" actually succeed by creating the perfect law enforcer and the cyborg is been called Robocop. Robocop becomes very successful with the public and the media, they think Robocop is the Ultimate Defender of Justice. Until the mind of Murphy has resurrected on Robocop and now taking personal revenge on the thugs, who murdered him. Directed by Paul Verhoeven (Black Book, Basic Instinct, Showgirls) made an thrilling, extremely well made violent film with plenty of action, humour, emotions and soul. Weller gives an solid believable performance as Murphy/Robocop in this instant classic film. The script is very clever and original as well. This film also stars Nancy Allen, Dan O'Herlihy, Miguel Ferrer, Ray Wise and Paul McCrane. Verhoeven's movie is an stylized cop-thriller.

"*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "i liked this movie quite a bit.it's very well paced,the acting is pretty good and it is ultra violent.it's basically about a part human,part cyborg cop who cleans up the streets of the city.there are some glitches along the way,of course.i think the movie,at its heart is a social satire.it's very relevant,even more so today.there are touches of irony and humour through out.Paul Verhoeven directed it and it's his first Americna movie.Verhoeven doesn't shy away from violence and if that sort of thing bothers you,you'll want to skip this movie.there is another,maybe more futuristic robotic cop,which i really like the look of.(possible minor spoiler ahead)there are two showdowns between RoboCop and this other futuristic,more advanced robot,both of which i found exciting and well done.for,me RoboCop is an 8/10" "I can't say that Paul Verhoeven is one of my favorite directors, but I have to admit that he definitely has a sense of humour. Robocop is a type of title that would make it sound like the dumbest thing on the planet or at the very least \"Diet Terminator\". Luckily the film is neither of these things. Robocop combines a rather standard action film with an interesting political message. A serious film is the best kind of satire and the various elements that make up the gritty tale of Robocop are what make it rather distinct in its B-film class. It is a violent film with a lot of heart. The 80s cheese-factor is noticeable in the film but luckily most of the film was shot very impressively and Robo himself only has a few moments of cheesy method-twitching. I was rather blown away by the quality of the stop-motion animation. In all Robocop is rather unusual film. It does not quite rise to the level of stand-out hits in the genre but is a notable film in its own right and definitely an enjoyable cinematic experience." "Robocop was a definite commercial success both in the United States and overseas. It has since become a classic example of the futurist genre alongside such great films as The Road Warrior, Blade Runner, and the much overlooked Charleton Heston classic Soylent Green. The thematic intertextuality of these films is clear, as they all deal in one way or another with issues such as overpopulation, the deterioration of the human lifestyle, consumerism and the corporation as the root of all evil. Robocop has earned it's place in popular culture as a prime example of its genre and has been nominated for Academy Awards in film editing and sound. Director Paul Verhoeven won the Saturn award in 1988 for his work on Robocop, and the film went on to receive more than a dozen awards and nominations including BAFTA and the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films. Robocop has become a classic meditation on the detritus of modernity, and reminds us not to lose our humanity in the rat race of the post industrial world." "This movie is both a reason not to lose hope in Hollywood, and at the same time painfully reminds us how tame, boring and stupid most of the action genre has become. Paul Verhoeven never used more efficiently the unparalleled resources Hollywood has to offer. With a decent - but not overblown - budget, he manages to show a spectacular display of action and great special effects that you can still watch today without laughing, unlike many other 80's movies. The story (a cop working in a corruption-ridden society is brutally murdered and turned into a robotic law enforcer) is fairly simple, and in other hands could've ended like many other childish action movies. But the satiric tone and the full-frontal violence not only validates the humor, but helps the audience to understand the social critic without hammering it down. It's a moral tale, but certainly not a lecture. The unbelievable boldness of the tone and the nifty execution turns this sci-fi/political pamphlet into a \"Clockwork Orange\"-like phenomenon. It's not aimed at kids, but if the brutality wasn't so over-the-top it should be shown to the youngest moviegoers, as the REAL action movie. No over-use of CGI. No annoying sidekick. No stupid humor or \"satisfactory\" ending. No compromise. The 21st century truly NEEDS a movie like this. Not a remake, or a reboot, or whatever fancy name the studios come up with. Just a new kind of no-nonsense, clever, ambitious big budget movies that doesn't insult the audience's intelligence for a change. To settle the score with subsequent shallow Hollywood flicks whose makers brag about carrying on RoboCop's legacy while reaching for the lowest common denominator (\"Iron Man\", anyone?). To set a new standard in blockbusters, an alternative to silly, brainwashing and heartless \"entertainment\". The sooner's the better." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Saw this in the cinema and have seen it numerous of times since. Fantastic from second one with an incredible story and super cast. The story of how technology has created the ultimate Super Cop. Poor Alex Murphy is gunned down by scumbag criminals and is recreated into RoboCop. The city is overrun by criminals and the hope is that RoboCop can bring some order to chaos. Peter Weller puts on a fine performance as RoboCop as his memories creep back of who he is and of who 'killed' him. Action is brilliant and eye pleasing as much as is the bloodshed!! Kurtwood Smith puts on an excellent show as Clarence Bodicker, the main bad guy too. The whole story of vengeance and corruption is so well versed in this movie and will certainly please all! Watch the director's cut for a real treat if you've seen this! Such a shame about the multitude of follow ups though........"

"oh my god what a movie!!! i was only 8 when this hit the cinemas in the UK so my 1st viewing was 9 when it was on VHS everyone at school was raving on about it and one day my dad came in drunk with a copy from the video rental store. i was scared at 1st given its 18 rating but when i seen it all the way through i was soon bouncing round the house thinking i was robocop shouting \"your move creep\" to any of my other toys that would listen. now as an adult watching it i can appreciate everything all over again including storyline,characters,plot and direction even to this day i still get that nostalgic 80's feel of the movie. granted it looks slightly outdated now and you can clearly tell its just a man in a suit but even to this day and for anyone who has not yet seen it there is something fascinating about the robocop character from the way he looks and moves to the great acting from peter weller robocop is like your dark side of a superhero for the more adult audience. if you love your 80's sci-fi movies then this is one of the greatest up the with the likes of 'the terminator' i have had many favourite movies I've loved over the years since robocop but this movie will always have a special place in my heart. a must and i mean MUST own DVD!!!" "When Alex J. Murphy (Peter Weller) is killed in the line of duty, OCP scientists put his brain into the ultimate law enforcement battle droid however when he starts remembering who he was, he sets out to avenge his brutal execution and along the way much blood spills. What makes Robocop such a classic is because the movie is more than just a good action flick. It has genuine ideas, black humor, excellent satire and an unpredictability that shows up most in the genre. Also there is a depth to the sequences where Peter Weller wonders what he's become and there is a really powerful scene where Weller walks into his house he owned when he was human, and his memories come flooding back. It's a mix of drama, humor and action that works to extreme satisfaction and although Robocop sometimes goes to excess, there is no denying that it is one of the best science fiction movies of the 80s. But what really makes this brilliant is mainly the acting and the characters, all of the characters are sketched out three dimensionally and the film gets it's moments of heart out of Weller's excellent performance. * * * * out of 4-(Excellent, a must see!)" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This is one of those movies you see again and again. Peter Weller portrays an police officer who gets shot a million times and dies. but then company officials decide to make a \"Robocop\" out of him. The quotes in this movie are endless and memorable! like: \"Rape Victim: Oh God, I was so scared! Thank you! RoboCop: Madame, you have suffered an emotional shock. I will notify a rape crisis center.\" In many ways this is a fun movie to watch, and there's plenty of action to go around to. So if you and your friends want some thrills and some laughs, i highly recommend \"Robocop\". 20 years after its release it's still as entertaining and memorable as it was then!" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Big words, perhaps, but in this case they are undoubtedly true. To compare RoboCop to films such as Casablanca, The Godfather or Rain Man would be foolish, but it easily ranks with these classics, even though it of course a very different film. RoboCop is probably looked upon as simply another sci-fi action film. A very good one, perhaps, but no more than that. To those who don't know a lot about films it is indeed probably a rather silly film about a man in a tin can shooting people. Indeed, on the surface, it pretty much is. Looking deeper the film it is clearly something of a revenge film, about a cop who is brutally murdered and comes back to avenge his death. But at the heart of the film, RoboCop is a story about the human spirit and how, despite however many mechanical additions are made to a person, they are still the same man underneath. Murphy is a regular cop, with a wife who he loves dearly and a son who he loves and tries to make happy, even if it is just through the simplest of things like imitating his son's favourite television character. He is of course though brutally murdered by a gang of thieves, and when he returns months later, is a cyborg law enforcer(a product of corporate America, in essence) who, despite the best efforts of the company who 'built' him (OCP), underneath all of the fancy new equipment he is still the same cop that began the film. Indeed, on his very first day on active duty (before he sets foot out of the police station, even) Murphy displays that, as he holsters his gun the same way as he had been practicing for his son. Slowly RoboCop, still only suspecting his true origins, pieces together his life as Murphy, and in the final act of the film, eventually comes to the inevitable conclusion that he was Murphy, and indeed still is Murphy. Thus, RoboCop is not simply a ghost in a machine, he is in fact a human being; the very same human being who started the film, albeit in a different body. As for RoboCop ranking up with some of the greatest films ever made, the answer is relatively simple. Now that we have discovered the true meaning of the film, we then realise how well put together the whole film actually is, from opening to closing. Not a scene is wasted, as every line spoken and every bullet fired (of which there are a lot) contribute to the film in a way that most action scenes do not. Whilst the same can be said for a lot of films (from Shawshank to Road House) it cannot usually be said for an 80s Action film, especially one that is predominantly played so seriously. Indeed, there are only a few times when the film invokes moment of excess and comic book-style violence. But this is always to get the point across. The ED-209 boardroom sequence, where the robot malfunctions and utterly obliterates a member of the board (and the following line \"somebody call a paramedic!\" when the man had been shot hundreds of times), is simply showing how warped corporate America has become. The same can be said for many of the films most violent scenes, such as Emil not only melting alive from the toxic waste, but then being run over and exploding like a water balloon, and even Murphy's own death at the hands of Clearance's gang, where Verhoeven just pushes the scene into ludicrous proportions when Murphy's entire right arm is blown off; although it is a scene of horror, when the arm goes one is almost forced to laugh as it is simply so silly. The violence isn't there to be 'cool,' it is a metaphor for the ridiculousness of many aspects of American society. And unlike most robot/cyborg films, the central character is not an unstoppable, cool and morally correct individual. RoboCop is a flawed human being, encased in a metal shell, trying to come to terms with his new existence (never has an actor invoked such a tearful performance using just his jawline), and whose actions are often morally ambiguous; for example, every time he stops a crime he does a lot more damage than the criminal was doing (destroying the convenience store, blowing up the petrol station etc.). The political and social satire, the brutal graphic violence, the tragedy of the main character, the special effects (which at the time were groundbreaking, and really haven't dated too badly at all), the brilliant main theme and the message of the film all place it among the very best that cinema has produced. Paul Verhoeven is a master director, and RoboCop is undoubtedly his (American?) masterpiece. To conclude, then, RoboCop is an action film with a heart, so much so that it is in no way shameful to cry at the last exchange of the film: \"Nice shooting, son. What's your name?\" \"Murphy.\"" "Being a cop can be dangerous, being a cop in the future can be twice as dangerous. Peter Weller does an spectacular job as \"Robocop\". Weller is Alex Murphy, a very dedicated cop who get transfered to the most heated precinct of Detroit. And on the first day of his job, he gets gunned down brutally by Boddicker(Kurtwood Smith) and his henchmen. His partner Officer Annie Lewis(Nacy Allen) rushes him to a hospital. There he becomes a perfect candidate for a cybernetic design fit for him: \"Robocop\". This piece of work may just give Steve Austin a run for his money. 10 times more durable, very accurate, and somewhat struggle to find out more secrets about the company who made him. I liked the parts where the would-be thief is taken care of swiftly, and the other part where he shot the would-be sex offender in the groin through her skirt! Apparently, she didn't care about her skirt, she was just grateful that she was rescued. Then, I liked the scene where he told one of the men who shot him to \"DROP IT!\" Those ED-209 droids were fun to watch, they were very flawed, because of the malfunctioning. It took the heavy gun to put it out of commission. Even battle-damaged, Robocop lived up to its name. Avery good sci-fi movie. And Ford got a lot of credit with their cars. I enjoyed this movie very much! 4 out of 5 stars!" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "The setting is futuristic Detroit. OCP (Omni Consumer Products) is a giant conglomerate company who owns almost everything, including Detroit's police department, which they run as a private enterprise operation. However the future is anything but perfect, in fact it's one big violent nightmare. \"Old Detroit\" as it's now called is overrun by criminal scum of all kinds & numerous officers are being murdered on the streets daily by the could hearted criminals which are quickly taking over the streets. In an attempt to curb crime & save money from hiring new officers & regain control of the streets. They seek a cheaper much more efficient way of dealing with crime, what else but a heavily armed robot? it can withstand a lot of punishment, doesn't have to be paid, will be on call 24/7 & cannot be killed! OCP vice-president Rich Jones (RONNY COX) & his team have been working on what they think is the answer: ED 209, a massive & very dangerous robot & what they think will be a perfect prototype & cheap & sufficient answer OCP is looking for. But when his creation malfunctions & violently kills a co-worker, his hard work & plans are trashed, by the head of OCP (DAN O' HERLIHY). Robert Morton a young yuppie like OCP employee, then presents his idea to the owner for creating a smaller, easier to control, but much more efficient, cyborg model, if only they could find the perfect specimenthis all comes to them, in the form of family man & fellow police officer ALEX MURPHY (PETER WELLER) who has re-located with his family from Metro South to a Precinct in Metro West Detroit. On his first day, Alex & his partner OFFICER ANN LEWIS (NANCY ALLEN) chase down an truck involved in an armed robbery at a bank, that just happens to be driven by a group of sadistic drug dealers. Tracing them to an abandon factory, Alex & Ann radio in for back-up but are told it cannot be sent, due to most of the units being tied up at the moment. They decide instead to head in themselves to apprehend the criminals, which proves to be a very big mistake, when Alex is brutally murdered by the drug dealers led by the cold hearted KURTWOOD SMITH. Morton immediately claims full ownership of Murphy's body, wiping Murphy's mind clean & then rebuilds his body with Armour & a computer in his head full of data & police commands & laws. Released to the public as \"RoboCop\" a well trained, well armed, half man, half machine, Murphy quickly rids the streets of the criminal scum who run it, while becoming a media sensation in the process. However he soon starts having flashbacks to his past & as a result, regains his full memory. Robocop then sets out to dispatch the violent felons who did him in. ROBOCOP has to be without a shadow of a doubt one of the best sci-fi action films ever made! it was so influential that it would spawn a whole catering of cyborg movies well into the 90's. The film is a refreshing (albeit violent) salty poke in the eye of the Regan-era sense ability prevalent at the time of it's release. It's loaded to the eyeballs with pitch black, droll humour featuring inane TV commercials (most of which promotes OCP products, video & board games). The film is insanely violent, as we see people thrown through plate glass windows, attempted rapes, a hand is blown off, bodies are literally shot almost to pieces with bullets, a body meltdown after a criminal has been dosed in toxic waste, various stabbings etc. Murphy's death in particular is one of the most violent ever committed to celluloid. The acting really works here, PETER WELLER was a good choice to play Robocop, while NANCY ALLEN stands out as Murphy's tough, but caring partner. KURTWOOD SMITH plays his villainous drug lord character to a hilt, while RONNY COX does well as the sadistic vice president of OCP, who attempts to destroy Robocop & re-install his own ED 209 robots. The direction by PAUL VERHOEVEN is perfection, as he is able to balance the action, science fiction & humour at a perfect balance & manages to capture all of the action set pieces at all the right angles. The only downside is, is that while the film is highly entertaining & it's plot really engaging & it's action set pieces tremendous, the film skimps on many other factors that I felt could have made the film that much better. For example we learn about a half hour in, that Murphy is a family man, with a loving wife & son & yet we never see Murphy with his family, we just catch glimpses of his past with them through a TV monitor, that Robocop has inside his memory bank. This plot point is incredibly watered down, so much so that it could so easily have been lifted from the film & we could still have a movie! A particular memorable (albeit sad sequence) sees Alex re-visitng his old home that he & his family moved into a few months prior when he re-located to this precinct, only to find the house empty & learning that his wife & kids have moved on. In fact, Murphy never meets his family again, who assume he's really dead & I felt this robbed the film of the emotional impact it could have had. All in all, ROBOCOP is highly recommended for all action fans, who want to see a nonstop in you're face action movie, you won't be disappointed! A box office smash that was quickly followed by a live action TV series in 1994, two animated children's series & a four part made for TV mini series called ROBOCOP: PRIME DIRECTIVES & a remake in 2014. Followed by two sequels, starting with ROBOCOP 2. **** stars" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "I was about 8 years old when I first saw RoboCop. Of course at that age I was much too young to be watching such a violent, grim movie but I loved every second of it. The breathless action, the dizzying pace and the surprising humour. As I got older, I began to realise the humour I'd picked up on was actually a very sly, cutting level of satire. RoboCop is not merely senseless violence (unlike some of director Paul Verhoeven's subsequent outings). It's a very carefully balanced blend of action with an astutely observed satirical view of the future that makes RoboCop a superior film of the genre. RoboCop is not too specific about how far into the future its set, but I assume the writers have placed it fairly close to our own time so its not too unrecognisable, but also distant enough with subtle changes in society to make it the near future. RoboCop is clever the way it draws the audience into this frighteningly realistic portrayal of our future. Instead of monologues or captions explaining what has happened to the world, the film quite ingeniously begins with a three minute news show headlining violent events underscored with a sharp wit, like neutron bombs used as a peace platform. Not to mention the hilarious adverts included that eat up the showtime, promoting everything from nuclear war boardgames for families to overpriced cars (6000 SUX!) with the slogan \"Bigger is Better. An American Tradition.\" The action is centred around the city of Old Detroit. Crime is rampant. Urban chaos is through the roof. And ever since OmniConsumer Products (OCP) took control of the police department, cop mortality rates have skyrocketed. Since OCP is nothing more than a faceless figurehead of heartless capitalism, they couldn't care less what happens to police precincts. So to remedy the crime in Old Detroit, Senior Vice President Dick Jones (Ronny Cox) has designed what he calls the future of law enforcement, ED 209. ED 209 is a giant cumbersome robot that is supposed to crack down on crime. But in one inspired scene, it is hilariously inept in everything it does. It makes mincemeat out of an executive after it unwaveringly follows its programming. And another exec comes up with a solution. Create a cyborg. Something that is programmed with police procedures, but tempered with the actual experience of being a cop. OCP get their chance when Officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) becomes a living shooting gallery at the hands of gangland hood Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith) and his cronies. OCP take what's left of Murphy, erase his memories, and turn him into RoboCop, a titanium armoured juggernaut, programmed with the desire to eliminate all crime. But when Murphy's human memories begin to surface, he tracks down Boddicker and his gang to get revenge. Including Jones, who's in league with Boddicker. If you look carefully behind all the bloodsoaked violence and shocking gore, you will find a very intelligent action film at the heart of RoboCop. It makes some very astute observations at the directions our society is headed. The idea that the police may strike because of the harsh conditions they're forced to endure is very frightening. As well as the notion that the youth of the future are being brainwashed by televised violence doesn't bode well either. Paul Verhoeven manages to get the focus just right in this film. He creates an extremely violent action film, but infuses it with a witty, satiric side that really enhances the viewing experience. I love the throwaway gags such as the urinals in the executive washrooms that have current interest rates above them. Verhoeven has never really managed to accomplish the same balance with his other SF films like Total Recall or Hollow Man. They have none of the intelligence of RoboCop. RoboCop's greatest asset was the inspired casting of Peter Weller. RoboCop is someone who has more than a passing resemblance to Judge Dredd. The top of his face is hidden, and we only see his jaw, and Weller manages to communicate an astonishing level of emotion. Consider the scene when he returns to his empty house after his wife and son have left. Memories of his previous life emerging briefly, and fading just as quickly. It demonstrates that Paul Verhoeven can infuse a tangible feeling of poignance when the need arises. Weller also does a superb job as RoboCop. With his monotone voice, stilted body language and lantern jaw, he gives a very realistic performance of a cyborg. On a par with Arnie's Terminator, Weller exudes authority, but also real sympathy for his situation. Which is not hard after we witness what happens to Murphy. A shockingly brutal demonstration of the callous disregard for life Boddicker's thugs have. Verhoeven keeps the action going but knows when to dial it down too. Something that doesn't always come easily to him. And its very gratifying watching Murphy whittle down the thugs who destroyed his life, eventually settling the score with Boddicker and Jones. The ending is bittersweet though. Murphy has reclaimed the humanity he was robbed of, but he can never go back to the way he was. And so it should be. There are no easy solutions here. Otherwise it would be a terrible ending to an exceptional action film. The sequels wavered in quality, but the original still holds the candle for being the most accomplished. An intelligent, witty, scathing action bonanza that still holds resonance today. Hard to believe it came from the director of Showgirls!" "I first saw this movie when I was three or four and was scared as hell! This movie is now quite possibly my favorite ever. There's a great blend of tragedy, deep storytelling, interesting shots, intense effects and insane action to satisfy anyone. There's (quite) a bit of blood so if you get sick easily avoid it. Everyone else must witness the awesome power of this sublime production. The effects are quite advanced. The stop motion ED-209 is mind-blowing. The Robocop suit is better than any CGI crap. I'll take props over green screen any day. This movie delivers intense action but also has a great, touching story about the loss of humanity. Peter Weller delivered a great performance, however uncomfortable he may have been. This movie has spawned two sequels, almost 100 comic books, toys and other random product (Robo Stationary), of which I have an interesting collection. Robocop is beyond cult status and I consider it to be an A movie, not a B movie. There are no real flaws in this movie but the action and the plot do slow down towards the end. However, the action does pick up. Robocop two is good, but not as amazing as the original. The end of the movie makes me smile every time I see it. This is truly a can't miss film for fans of sci-fi, action, satire or anyone looking for a cool movie." "It is Steven Spielberg Himself who encouraged Paul to come to the States to work on film making in and for Hollywood. Paul was not very interested at the beginning. When He first saw the script of Robocop, he thought it was rubbish. Sounds like a low budget B movie, maybe. But his wife didn't agree with this first impression and encouraged him to work on it. And the Dutch man did so. And provided one the best Action movie ever done. And trust me, I watched Lots of them! \"Robocop\" is very closed to perfection. Great casting, to begin with. From Murphy himself to Clarence Bodicker, one of the worst Villain ever portrayed. And everything is great in this movie. The Scenario is clever and realistic. The Editing also is terrific. There are no \"blank\" scenes whatsoever. It is action, action and action. Non stop with clever links. The music, the soundtrack, is also very efficient. This movie wont be as good if Paul didn't direct it. Paul got the power from Hollywood and he managed it very well!I love you Paul !" "A Great and totally originial Sci-Fi/Action treat! A movie of sheer excellence, and past all the blistering torcherous violence, there is a fantastic story in which some failed to see. Peter Weller gave a terrific zing to the character and I'm really wishing he stayed with the franchise, coulda provided some shred of hope for the catastrosphe which many fans of this film now know as Robocop 3. Nancy Allen was equally as breathtaking alongside the lead man, her care for Weller was portrayed so sincerely, it was nice to give Robocop a female opposite him, I felt more of stronger presence emotionally with Weller and Allen than I would with Glover and Gibson in Lethal Weapon for example. The villains were outstanding, I remember how much I hated Kurtwood Smith when I first saw this movie, meaning just how great of a villain he was, so empty, sadistic and menacing, a perfect portrayal. Ronny Cox did it for me as well. Paul Verhoeven's craftsmanship is masterful, it's also a shame he left the franchise I wished he had stayed for at least Robocop 2, he really gave this movie a feel that it's sequel lacked, that superior punch in the face of emotion combined with the intense violence, brilliance, one of my all time favourite movies and one of the first films that attracted me to cinema" "Add another review" "Find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your Watchlist and rate your favorite movies and TV shows on your phone or tablet!")("Movies, TV & Showtimes" "Celebs, Events & Photos" "News & Community" "Watchlist" "" "Find industry contacts & talent representation" "Manage your photos, credits, & more" "Showcase yourself on IMDb & Amazon" "Sign in with Facebook Other Sign in options" "Own the rights?" "I don't know why, but somehow this movie got to me more than any Sci Fi Action. Maybe its the cool story, maybe its the perfect storytelling, maybe its the futuristic drama we can find in some scattered places or maybe its the perfect acting from all the actors. Director Paul Verhoeven has directed the movie, and he is one of my personal all time favorite directors (alongside John Carpenter). He made more Sci Fi masterpieces, Total Recall and Starship Troopers, but this still is his greatest moment. Every single detail seems to be thought out completely and the direction is made with love. On his front, there are no negative parts. The acting is great, despite absence of those superstars like Tom Cruise and Mel Gibson. The movie proves that actors who are pretty unknown can make great performances. Peter Weller rocks the sh*t out of many actors with his spotless performance and so does almost every other actor. Maybe I haven't told you enough about the movie itself, but if you just start to look at it, you'll get hooked and after the movie you'll love it. Too bad that the two sequels qualify themselves to the bottom 100." "Major spoilers ahead. Dutch director Paul Verhoeven's \"Robocop\" is a masterful tale of a cybernetic human who has lost his humanity to the corporation that owns him, and his journey not only to exact vengeance on his murderers, but to regain his pre-mortem identity. This dystopian science fiction movie is quite unique because its vision of dystopia incorporates the perils of laissez-faire capitalism and the bloated conglomorates which have taken over peoples' lives. The nightmarish world of \"Robocop\" can be interpreted as an exaggeration of what Verhoeven saw as the problem with American capitalism, that private interests overcame the public good. The conglomerate portrayed in this movie cares little for public safety, even as it buys the decrepit police department of Old Detroit. Its officers, facing a losing battle against heavily-armed thugs and organized criminals, are merely nothing more than gears in the conglomerate's machine, and their lives are worth nothing unless they can turn a profit. So it is with Murphy, the protagonist, whose death proves portentous for one higher-up in the company, who uses the policeman's brain and corpse to power his pet project, \"Robocop.\" The inventor's rival also manufactures a tank-like war machine, intended for law enforcement, and sees Robocop as a threat. The latter company man, the evil Dick Jones, sees the threat as competition for his robot tank which, as he explains in the movie, even if it is a failure (at the expense of one company man's life), is valuable for its parts. Verhoeven's cynicism is extreme for his movie's vision of dystopia, as corporate capitalism colludes with organized crime for their own mutual interests rather than for the public good. The deceased Murphy has indeed lost his humanity, not only by becoming a robot, but also by being considered the corporation's property; he is not an individual, but a patented product. Robocop's assertion of individuality by exacting vengeance on his killers, and later against the corporation that sponsored them, is Verhoeven's allegoric demonstration of the individuals will to assert himself against those who see him as a mere cog in a machine, in this case a thing to be owned and to make profit for a corrupt capitalist oligarchy. Late-twentieth century news media---and the 1980s concerns of the Cold War, Latin American proxy wars, and the bourgeois culture of greed and consumption---are viciously and hilariously lampooned in a series of faux news broadcasts. It was wonderful of Verhoeven to include some delicious irony in his satire by casting Mary Hart, the bubbly blond co-host of \"Entertainment Tonight\" as a news anchor---one might argue that Hart, unknowingly or not, is caricaturing and parodying real life identity as a purveyor of superficial entertainment reporting. Those who sincerely believe in the capitalist ethos may be off-put by Verhoeven's extreme cynicism with the get-rich-quick way of life but it does bring a very interesting spin to the genre of science fiction which very few directors have been able to portray. The closest film which depicts this sort of dystopia is \"Blade Runner,\" also about consumer products asserting their individuality, but without the satiric bite of Verhoeven's masterpiece. Frank Weller is excellent as Robocop. The other actors all lend credibility to this marvelous film. It is filled with enough action and special effects to please any lover of action or science fiction movies. On important caveat is that this is an extremely violent movie. Verhoeven loves to be gruesome, and he dresses his violent flick to the nines. Do not let very small children watch this film. Other than that, I highly recommend this excellent science fiction classic." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Verhoeven has said that this movie,for him, is about the creation of an American Jesus. Being an American Jesus, therefore, Robocop shoots the bad guys to bring them to salvation. I must say, for years before I listened to Verhoeven's commentary for the film, I never understood this movie in that particular way. My understanding had been much more straightforward: a story about a man brought back from the dead to be used as a crime fighting machine, and, potentially, as a weapon of oppression by the power elites of OCP. That's Directive Four. It's also a horror movie about the forcible intrusion into the body of sharp, mechanical, hard edged things, against one's will. A horror story of a human identity trapped in an ugly mechanical shell. And just why is it that they keep Murphy's face? That always struck me as perverse, more of a designer's fancy than practical. I find the story, for all of its horror and cynical humor, to be uplifting: Murphy finds a way to exist in his new state of being, and regains an essential kind of humanity. He's still bound by his directives (that sinister Directive Four humming ominously away in his consciousness) but it's better than not knowing why he does what he does. Critics have been very unkind to the first sequel, Robocop 2. I find Robocop 2 to be just as brilliant, if not as tight and smooth as Verhoeven's original. Robocop 3 lost the thread for me, though it has one or two moments. Also of interest is Takashi Miike's own remix of Robocop, Full Metal Yakuza." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "What you normally expect from a 80s action film is big muscles, horrendous puns and oodles of homoeroticism. Instead RoboCop is an excellent satire with plenty of violence on the side. A pretty good combination, if I don't say so myself What's most worrying about watching RoboCop almost twenty years since it was released is how acutely the media portrayed in the film correlates with the media today. Hell, Media Break might as well just be called Fox News! Just take the glib, insincere way that Casey Wong says 'Get well, Frank.' It's just the same as some mindless cheerleader of a reporter whooping 'Marines kick ass!' Everything is reduced to inane soundbites. And then there's Corporate America. The film was made during the 'greed is good' era, but things haven't changed. It's still a macho, testosterone packed world where profits and personal advancement come first. After all, what matters more, that someone gets killed or that the 'glitch' that got the person killed costs the company $50m in interest payments? I think you know the answer. But there's also the references to Vietnam ('urban pacification' and McNamara), the state of American manufacturing (6000 SUX), privatisation, the American style of policing (reading someone their rights as you thrown them through a window) and religion (Verhoeven suggests that RoboCop is like Jesus. He gets crucified, he dies and he gets resurrected. And quite appropriately for an American Jesus, he kills a lot of people). So there's a lot there if you want to look for it However, just as an action spectacle the film more than delivers. The action sequences are universally superb. The best one of all is probably the drug factory shoot-out. The music is great, the shots are superbly picked and there's none of that schizophrenic editing that you get in modern action films. Here you can actually see what's happening! Another great piece of action is the gas station explosion. Ah, the age without CGI But the action would be empty if you didn't care about the hero. Thankfully, though, you doeven when he's a tin can! I mean, Murphy must have one of the most grisly deaths on celluloid. He's blown to bits, taunted ('Does it hurt?') and then ruthlessly executed. If you didn't care for him before, you do afterwards. And when he becomes RoboCop, he still manages to elicit more sympathy than most action heroes. Most of this is probably because he's so obviously flawed. Sure he's a ruthless killing machine but he's been stripped of his identity, his family and even his body ('lose the arm'). So when he revisits his house and sees what he lost and when like Frankenstein he sees his reflection and when he's hunted down by his own colleagues; you can't help but feel for him. I also have to admit that I can't help but feel sorry for Bob when he's killed. He's a slimy scumbag, yeah, but anyone who lives the American Dream by doing cocaine with bimbos can't be all bad. And I also have say that his death scene has one of the best lines in film history: 'Bitches leave.' Clarence Boddicker is such a charmer. And that's another thing that makes the film so enjoyable; it's main villain. Clarence Boddicker is exactly what you want every movie villain to be: irredeemably evil. He even kills his own men. You don't get much better than that Perhaps the only bad thing about RoboCop is ED-209. But even that's good. I'll never tire of him mowing down a hapless junior executive (I love the way that his colleagues push him out of the way. Gordon Gekko would be proud). In fact, RoboCop makes me pine for an era free from CGI, where fascist violence was liberal and where there was lots of good old-fashioned cussing. What's happened to mainstream cinema these days? Surely with George W.Bush in charge, political successor to Ronald Reagan as he is, the streets of Hollywood should be flowing with blood by now" "When people hear the words Robocop they often make the mistake of categorising it as yet another sci/fi action movie like the Terminator. Robocop is so much more then that. Robocop is a message, a warning about the dangers of unchecked capitalist ambition and greed. Robocop took the negative aspects of 80's cut-throat society and placed them into a futuristic environment. As such Robocop must be treated with a special reverence amongst films, this is not simply another film but rather a work of genius that allows all those who watch the film to gain an understanding of 1980's society. Robocop is indeed a philosophical masterpiece. The Suffering of Alex Murphy/Robocop is perhaps best comparable to the saviour myth of many religions including Christianity. Robocop is the great Irony whilst he personifies moral corruption it is he who will save Human Society from self destruction. As a film Robocop has it all, a great Plot backed up by Great Characters. Notably Clarence Boddicker the films villain. Hde is perhaps one of the most believable and effective screen villains of all time. The great story and characters are backed up by premium effects and high paced action. In conclusion Robocop is a life changing film that you will want to watch again and again." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Along with the Terminator this was the best scifi action film to come out during the 1980's. Though Peter Weller didn't become a household name, he does an excellent job as a murdered police officer, who is resurrected as a type of cyborg programmed to fight crime. As \"Robocop\" he dispenses justice with computer controlled pinpoint shooting accuracy. There is a lot of camp (some of it is extremely funny) which does nothing to diminish the serious drama of the film. Nancy Allen does a good job as Robocop's partner and look for the guy from That 70's Show as the evil villain." "Truly science fiction action-film at its perfection. Director Paul Verhoven (of Total Recall) paints a distopic view of future Detroit, a crime-ridden city where cops are threatening to go on strike. A large corporation that practically runs the United States Military comes out with a new machine: Robocop. This film explores the hauntingly Frankenstein-esque life of a man who has died and been transformed into a machine, or rather, super-human. The film asks questions, like what does it mean to be human? We explore the human side of robocop, as he uncovers his mysterious past. He finally gets to confront, and possibly get revenge on his killers. The film also challenges ideas of growing corporate control, as shown by the corrupt nature of OCP, a corporate entity who becomes \"above the law.\" It explores the city, a corrupt city much like an American version of of Moscow, where criminals have infiltrated the highest levels of corporate power. The distopic city has been so neglected that there is a \"New Detroit\" or \"Delta City\" where there can be hope, the rich can live in, and be away from the unsavable crime of \"old detroit.\" Although the film was made in the 80's, it is definitely still watchable today. It has much violence and gore, and is quite realistic in its special effects which are mostly animatronic. The special effects still live up to this day, and give the film a certain \"edge.\" In addition, this film challenges certain notions about corporate control of the military, and how the military-manufacturing industry, when out of control, can become dangerous to the common man and common society. It is an important watch in the strange world we are seeing develop in the United States. With such great questions & futuristic action, this film wins in both the action & science fiction category, and is easily one of the most perfect marriages of the two genres. It even has good acting, which can be rare for both of these genres. 10/10!!! (rare)" "Robocop is a film that almost didn't get made. Most people loved the concept, but hated everything else, especially the title. Some say this film is about violence and it is violent. (30 people are killed in the film according to this site)The film has to be violent to get the point across that something like Robocop is necessary, but the film is not about violence. It is more then a bloody action film. Paul Verhoven has stated that he intended this film to be more about death and resurrection then anything else. To state the idea that the sort of everyman that the character of Alex Murphy embodies could overcome death to rise again. Only to find that it is not worth the trip. Although that is felt throughout the whole film, deeper than that is what Edward Neumeier said he wanted to make the film about. What would life be like if Reaganomics had kept going? What if the yuppie population had continued to grow? What if the whole world became populated by guys like Dick Jones? (played so superbly by Ronny Cox that it is hard to tell where Cox ends and Jones begins) Alex Murphy lives in a world just like that. In a world where mans unchecked greed is finally starting to consume him. In Murphy's world there are no people, there are only consumers. Those who cannot afford to consume, become themselves consumables and are consumed. O.C.P could be any number of corporations. It is a symbol of everything that is wrong with our country. It is accumulated wealth and power, it is the big unfeeling beast that devours everything in it's path, including our friend Alex Murphy. They do not rob Murphy of his life, but of his death. They remove his dignity and strip him down to nothing more then another product, but Murphy fights back. Murphy retains something more than the memories they took from him, he retains the feelings of being human and becomes more than a machine with a human face, more then just Robocop the product. Peter Weller gives him that face and that emotion. Even behind the face shield on the helmet that Weller wears thought most of the film we can still feel his pain. We can see the hurt in his eyes, even though his eyes our covered. Alex Murphy is as Verhoven has stated a futuristic Christ. He bears the weight of our greed and the sin of or lust for wealth. We can see ourselves as the victimized Alex Murphy and we can wonder how much it would take for us to become the victimizing Dick Jones." "Many people give lame reviews for Robocop but I found it a very entertaining and in-your-face movie. The acting was, actually, pretty good and the story was deep. One thing that drew me to this movie was its raw humor. Parts of the film are so cheesy that it adds to the film's laughs and makes it more unique. Robocop himself is a great design and one of the better Sci-Fi characters in recent history. Peter Weller plays Robocop in his one truly famous role. The Musical Score is terrific and you will find your self humming it after the film's end. The film is surprisingly bloody, but in a good way. Robocop is a very violent revenge story(Rated R) and the action is first class for an 80's movie. The film is funny and creative, the bad guys are cool, and Weller's voice is a perfect human and machine fusion. I fully recommend Robocop for anyone(who doesn't mind blood)with an open mind seeking something different and fun." "A classic should be something that time does little about its grandeur. Well that happens here. There's no over-extended scenes or unnecessary dialogue, yet, the characters' construction is superb. It's a basically a 'futuristic urban story'; but still is full of ironies about corporative-controlled institutions, media and the place of individual beings in a collapsed society, things that affect us today. Michael Miner and Edward Neumeir's script is very influenced by comic-books and their particular ways of narrative, and it was a great update of a sci-fi classic theme (robotics) for a whole generation. Needless to say that the 'Primal Directives' of Robo are very similar to the 'Three Laws of Robotic' of Isaac Asimov. Paul Verhoeven is one of the greatest directors in history. RoboCop established him as a strong name in Hollywood and gained him lots of fans and even the respect of some intellectual critics always fond on destroying films like this one. The performance of the cast is subtle, but convincing. The most impressive performance is given by the whole cast not by a particular actor or actress. The bloodshed actually works fine showing how Detroit will be: lethal and unsafe. Everyone could be shredded in the streets of the post-urban Detroit. The combination of good actors, agile montage, non-static cameras, great FX and a beautiful score, made a masterpiece that should be used as an example in Cinema's Schools. If you never paid attention to the score composed by Basil Poledouris, it is a shame. It's worth owning given its elegant, grand and constant changing tunes. It fits just fine with every piece of celluloid is accompanying. All kinds of emotions can be unleashed upon hearing it: sadness, melancholy, triumph, tension; very original classical inspired music."

"This classic piece of cinematic art was helmed by dutch uber director Paul Verhoeven. It is kind of a humanoid terminator and whereas most would think that Robocop is but another robo action-flick,- most would be dead wrong. This is actually a robo actionflick with soul and the kind of themes that usually features in Verhoeven films. Instead of a hard-ass hero, we see that Robocop is actually a tragic hero who is de-humanised by the technology that saved his life. This movie is a visual feast and was way ahead of its time...having said that, it kicks serious ass even in modern day standards. And with all the versus movies doing the rounds...AvP FvJ, I half expect Robocop VsTerminator in the not too distant future." "When i first saw the 1st Robocop, i was about 6 years old and my mum had edited out all the graphically violent parts. Then i saw the original version with the violence when i was about 10. And now i have just recently purchased the special edition DVD and it has the full uncut version and oh my god it is brilliant. It has extra gore on the ED 209 sequence towards the beginning, during the mutilation of poor old Murphy and at the end where the main bad guy dies, i wont go into details about the changes, but i will say one thing, this makes it the most violent films ever to hit the DVD shelves. The film itself still contains all the original parts to it and still holds up as one of the greatest movies of the 20th century. Pure 100% adrenaline fueled mayhem combined with a dark look at a possible future to be." "At least in my mind, he takes a script that probably shouldn't have worked when you think about it. A man behind a machine in the 80's? Preposterous, but Verhoven pulls it off with a big hand from Peter Weller in the character of Murphy/Robo. If you're not a big fan of gore this probably isn't for you, Verhoven mentions in the DVD commentary of the directors cut (at least in Australia) that \"You couldn't have the resurrection without the crucifixtion\" and indeed Murphy's death is one of the most brutal scenes I've ever seen, especially in the directors cut as Murphy gets blown away by a group of thugs who knew they had him right where they want him before he's whisked away to the hospital and a seeming death, fade to black. The End. Or so you think, I kinda agree with Verhoven when he says he wanted 10-15 seconds of black before the movie. That would've worked well. Anyway we return with Murphy as Robocop, the new cyborg police machine who immediately makes an impact on the streets of Detroit, but the man behind the machine begins getting flashbacks of his life as Murphy and soon looks to take revenge. I should mention the marvellous performance by Kurtwood Smith in the role of Bodicker, one of the great villians but his role is somewhat underrated. Later on we find that Bodicker is working for OCP but when Robo tries to attack the OCP head we finally learn of \"Directive 4\" Never harm an OCP employee, which all leads to the shootout finale as Bodicker and his toughs try to terminate Robo like they did Murphy. It also features one of the more innovative ways to kill a mega-villian. The movie ends with Robo confronting OCP with the evidence of ED-209s creators collusion and again a simple solution sees him reach his end. Then just like that end of movie. Robocop probably was a few years before it's time and thus isn't as fondly remembered as some films but it's one of the best action movies out there today and fans of that genre won't be dissapointed picking this one up. Everyone was on song in this movie. From the director to the actors to the special effects guy to the guy that got everyone's coffee. Everyone put 110% into their roles and took what on paper may have been an average screenplay and made it a great one. I give it **** or 8/10" "Paul Verhoeven is a master of the futile and messy death, and nowhere does he show this off to better effect than Robocop. The titular character is almost totally covered in impenetrable armour, so when he walks into a gunfight, he cannot be hurt, but the stage can be set for an fetishtically long sequence where countless hoodlums are written off with a single shot while blazing away uselessly. The titular character's nemesis is a walking tank that orders suspects to throw away their guns or be shot, but then malfunctions and shoots them anyway. You can see from this the sort of sense of humour Paul Verhoeven has. And this isn't even the worst the movie has to offer. The goal here is the same as Starship Troopers: take a simple leftist idea like the safeguarding of individual rights or opposition to unrestricted capitalism or militarism, and dress it up with so much violence that the political dimension will be the last thing on anyone's mind. Stupid, conservative, politically-correct North America thus misses the forest for the trees. Sorry, I haven't mentioned the actual movie itself yet. It's good stuff. It shows its 80s roots strongly, but not in a bad way. Upper management having a cocaine party, for example, or \"the orbiting SDI platform misfiring and killing two former US presidents!!!\" Take that Reagan! Oh, sorry, there's the political edge again." "When I first saw Robocop I must have been about nine or ten years old: my mum was at work and my dad had sneaked out to a mates house in order to smuggle me the forbidden film. I had heard about it from a mate at school and was desperate to see it. Within the first few minutes I was enthralled. I was totally convinced I was watching an accurate portrayal of the future - it is gritty, yet authentic. The most impactual element for me - back then - was the extreme nature of the violence, and therin lies the main problem people have with the text. Yes, as a ten year old, the blood and gore is the main attraction - but Robocop is a film which rises above the box office draw reasons to create a multilayered and meaningful film. The notions of corporate power are explicitly unmdermined as inherantly corrupt in the ruthless characterisations of Dick Jones et el. The police are portrayed as humans with faults - unusual for a film whose principle charcter is a cyborg hero. And of course the lead role is a perfect vehicle for an examination of what REALLY makes us 'human'. The inclusion of the way the American media sanitises shocking events and turns them into entertainment, or even something to sell, is especially relevent today. The special armour effects by Rob Bottin are second to none, the stop motion - although dated - fits perfectly with the style of the film and does not stand out as a bad thing, and Verhoven pulls all of the punches on the witty dialogue and visceral violence. Weller shines in the role of Murphy and Clarence Boddicker is a suitably soddish villain. Many people feel that the storytlene mirrors that of Christ - its certainly about retributional violence and Murphy is an almost Christ-like figure (at least in his progression) so maybe there is some weight to the argument. Don't worry about that til the film's over though! Highlights include an arrest at an attempted rape, the toxic waste sequence and Clarence being \"deep-throated\" by Robo's spike!" "Peter Weller plays Alex Murphy, a good cop who is killed in the line of duty by a ruthless gang of villians led by the very excellent Kurtwood Smith. His dead body is then used in an experiment to create the perfect law enforcer...Robocop. All goes well until Robocop starts remembering his previous life and tries to piece together Murphys past which leads him to discover the events leading up to Murphy's death. This film could have been ruined had it not been for the excellent script, great special effects, brilliant performances by the cast including Ronny Cox as the villanous Dick Jones and not forgetting Peter Weller in the title role. Check out Nancy Allen in what some have said is the best role of her career. Dutch director Paul Verhoeven throws in some excellent satire with adverts like Nuke-Em which appears after a news report on the threat of nuclear confrontation. Not forgetting the news reports themselves which feature some excellent Irony \"Top story, the Star Wars orbitting Peace Platform misfired today, three ex president's are amongst the dead.\" Every base is covered in this film and we feel empathy for Murphy's character throughout. It's amazing to think that this film cost a third of what Robocop 2 cost to make but is far superior than the two sequels and the tv series's put together. It's just shows that money is not everything when it comes to making one of the greatest Sci-Fi Action films of all time. Imagination, character development, good story and great script is. I cannot go without mentioning the excellent stop motion scenes involving ED-209. This was before CGI but the effect is superb. If you haven't already seen this film then you must.....Must...MUST. THAT IS THE LAW......Thank you for your co-operation." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "SPOILERS Ok, 1987, Paul Verhoeven directed and released his finest work. That piece of movie history was \"Robocop\", and compared with all his other works, it is still miles ahead in terms of quality. In this movie we are introduced to Peter Weller's Alex J Murphy. Murphy is a new transfer to possibly the worst police station in Detroit. In this near future where everything looks advanced, despite still being scarily 1980s, humanity has become even more capitalistic and crime is at an alltime high. Murphy goes out on patrol with his new partner Officer Anne Lewis, played with a grating irritation by Nancy Allen, and on their first outing is butchered by a group of men lead by the evil Clarence Boddicker. Out of pure coincidence however, at this time the corporate company who runs the police force is experimenting with cyborg policemen and using Murphy's body, they create the future of Law Enforcement, the title character, the Robocop. Murphy's resurrected being goes out into the world to fight crime, stop his murderers, and rediscover himself. Let's just say straight away that this movie is great. The special effects for the time they were based are impressive and the direction by Verhoeven, who planned for this to be a modern retelling of the story of Jesus Christ, is equally amazing. It's hard to know what to say next about this movie really. All the acting, with the exception of the infuriating Allen, is relatively straight forward and nothing too special, but then it was never meant to be anything breathtaking. Ultimately this film is about the action and the question of what it is to be human. Verhoeven does attempt to answer all his philosophical questions, and what he does is impressive, ultimately though, it's as a violence filled movie which this piece will be remembered best as. Put your feet up, press play on your video or dvd player, and enjoy once the finest movies of the 1980s." "When Robocop was released in 1987 it was fresh and original. Nothing had been done exactly like this before and it shows. The actual feel of the movie was amazing and still is. At times violent and brutal but totally enjoyable at the same time. ED-209 looked and moved great (hah! who needs CGI!) and the excellent famous line \"I bet you think you're pretty smart huh? Think you can outsmart a bullet?\" (which was sampled for a couple of top hip-hop and rave tunes) is just one good example of how clever some of the quotes are in this film . The weapons are awesome and a lot of skill went in to making this movie. It could so easily have sucked like Robocop 3 but this movie was in the right hands. The eighties was such a great decade for movie making that if Robocop had been made now it would most likely suck as it would be made less violent for the mainstream viewer even if the effects would be technically superior. Miss this gem at your peril! 10/10" "RoboCop is a classic satirical science fiction film that is probably too violent (and sex saturated) for young children, and a little comicy for thinking adults--which makes it perfect for that money-spending mass we call teens. Plot Synopsis: In near-future Detroid suffering from uncontrolled crime, a young policeman gets shot trying to stop a vicious criminal--and his body is used to make a prototype android-policeman--a cop that never tires, always shoots 100% accurate and has cool shiny protective metal body, and even delivers sarcastic oneliners. But just when RoboCop becomes media sensation and a hope of ridding the city of crime, he faces evil both from the criminal element and the corruption within the Police. The movie is strong on the art direction/ production design--from RoboCop's catchy appearance, to the crime-ridden, decaying Detroid in the near-futuristic America, where Police is privatized. The most memorable sequences is when the aryan looking cop gets resurrected via becoming RoboCop--we do not see how RoboCop looks, as he walks and we see everything through his digitized POV...yet we catch a quick glance of his head in a monitor (or was it a mirror?). And by now everyone knows the film is a satire on the over-the-top media use in U.S. etc. The score is also memorable and heroic-themed. the script is pretty tight, and makes the film roll fast. With the exception of one unnecessary gory sequence in the end, in which a criminal gets acidized and becomes something like a liquid melting chunk of flesh (AND he gets hit by a van), this movie is great, though its atmosphere, if you forget the humour, can seem a little chilly and alienated--which is fitting enough for a movie about an android cop. **** Vlad" "A new Detroit cop is slayed by a band of violent criminals and is chosen to be the test subject of a new cyborg cop program called \"Robocop\". Things start out great, if the criminal body count can be described as great, but Robocop begins to regain his memory. He sets out to find out who he was, and when he does begins a hunt to get back at the criminals who slayed him. fueled by violent, pulsating action, Robocop will give action fans about all of what they look for in an action movie. the film is quite violent though, the criterion DVD is suppose to be much more violent. The ED 209 cyborg is amazing. ***/4" "Add another review" "Find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your Watchlist and rate your favorite movies and TV shows on your phone or tablet!")("Movies, TV & Showtimes" "Celebs, Events & Photos" "News & Community" "Watchlist" "" "Find industry contacts & talent representation" "Manage your photos, credits, & more" "Showcase yourself on IMDb & Amazon" "Sign in with Facebook Other Sign in options" "Own the rights?" "This movie is full of symbolism, social commentary and political satire, it is worth watching more than once. It is far more than a typical action movie and is in the same league as other classics like Highlander, The Road Warrior, Aliens and Terminator (1 & 2). I won't go into detail about the plot because if you are the type of person who enjoyed the above mentioned movies you should run, don't walk, to your nearest DVD store and buy it immediately. This film is so well written and directed that it could be used in a film school to show students how it should be done. Yes the acting is over the top, yes it is extremely violent, and yes the story seems outlandish but this is a real diamond-in-the-rough. If you don't agree then you just don't get it and never will, you're not a sci-fi fan and think this is just another action movie. If you do agree, you probably already own it and have seen it at least three times. Far superior the the sequel which is still worth watching but pales in comparison to the original. If you haven't seen it in a while, watch it again... and pay attention to the details." "A huge hit when it was released in 1987, Robocop was a great action movie and a lot smarter than its maybe given credit for. It spawned a classic arcade game and many a bedroom wall had a Robocop poster on it. Its up there with the The Terminator, Rambo, Aliens and Predator as one of the definitive action films of the 80's. Of course they soiled its reputation by two awful follow ups Robocop 2 and Robocop 3 which even original star Peter Weller passed on. As ever the original is best and is well worth buying on DVD as long you don't buy it with the other two films." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Won't worry about spoilers, cause this is not really a whodunnit. Robocop remains one of the high points of Hollywood movies in the late eighties. Who let Paul Verhoeven direct it? They probably regretted it a thousand times through production, but no-one else could have taken such a ridiculous script and made it into such an admirable movie. Watch it for the satire on modern american society and Reaganism (striking, privately owned cops?). Sure, some of the effects are a little ropey now, but Weller's stand-out physical performance is one of the best mimes ever to make it onto film. I genuinely think he deserved at least an oscar nomination for this. It's so easy to forget that he isn't really a robot. With a strong stomach necessary, this is unmissable." "Police officer is killed and rebuilt as a cyborg, goes gunning for the lowlives that killed him. Sounds like a real silly movie, doesn't it? It should and that is how the sequels and all other movies trying to imitate this movie come off. In this case, Paul Verhoeven weaves a tale that can entertain both the thinker and the action fan. I've seen a documentary where Peter Weller said that he wished the violence that was cut out to make the 'R' rating was left in. He felt it made the film more funnier. I beg to differ. With one exception, the violence was cartoonish enough that anymore would've bogged it down and the exception had to be that way. One of the best things of the movie is that Ronny Cox, Kurtwood Smith and Paul McCrane play some of moviedom's most vilest and memorable of villains. Up to that point, one usually found these three playing some of the more sensitive characters. And they pull it off! Chock full of quotable lines and seemingly throw-a-way parts that come back to mean something later, this movie is a lot of fun." "The story of a cop who is killed and brought back to life as a cyborg by a major company called OCP corporations, Robocop has a little bit of everything a person could want in a movie. It keeps you guessing, The reactions of Weller's Robocop are astounding and emotional. Most people laugh when I recommend Robocop. They think it's terrible. Most of the blame can be placed on Robocop 3, the movie which made people shudder at the sight or thought of Robocop on the Silver/small screen, and thus, Robocop fans suffer: Unable to see a decent new project or sequel by the original team. Verhoeven's direction in Robocop is some of his finest, and Peter Weller is honestly the only person suited to play the character in my opinion. He has the voice, the image, the structure both physically and in his acting. Nancy Allen shines as does Kurtwood Smith and all the supporting cast. The movie is truly one of the best films ever made, offering action, romance, suspense, drama, science fiction, horror (or gore if you want to call it that), as well as great acting, directing, and script writing. This franchise was one of the most poorly exploited, and it's a damn shame too. Highly, Highly recommended." "RoboCop is interesting on various levels for various reasons. In the first three minutes alone we are exposed to a total parody of everything we see on TV--health advertisements claiming compassion and long life, civil dispute, and global conflict all viewed from the safety of your own home (\"It's OK, he saw it on the TV\"). Everything from the obvious business corruption and defective merchandise (\"I'm sure it's only a glitch.\") to architecture and even music. Paul Verhoeven hit his highest mark as a director with this movie. It is not empty-headed like Starship Troopers and doesn't have a dependency on violence like Total Recall. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Total Recall has one violent act every seven minutes, minimum. Whereas in Total Recall, the carnage is merely titillation for action fans, RoboCop has a hidden moral to its message. The pacing is terrific, even though the DoP must have been loafing during production. RoboCop also infuses the original Frankenstein story in an amazing way. Peter Weller's character is frightening yet awesome. He is human and machine with the traits of both, but what happens when one starts becoming dominant? What happens when he starts having emotions? The rest of the cast (except Kurtwood Smith) are comic book in nature. Smith as Clarence Boddicker is the only one who manages to draw more than the typical 2D response because of his nagging charisma. He may not be talented, but here his ability is displayed in whatever glory it can attain. Overall, I found this movie more than satisfying, but weak-stomached individuals (who have no grasp of the real world) will detest its level of brutality. 4.5 out of 5 stars." "I recently bought the 3DVD Box containing all the Robocop movies. Part 2 and 3 aren't really worth mentioning after having seen the original. Robocop's a pure classic with lots of black humour, a very appealing (though tragic) \"hero\" and the real fierce and mean baddie Clarence Boddicker. Ah yes, there also is alot of gunfire, blood, gore and most above all a real message this movie delivers. Find out for yourselves (if there's still anybody that hasn't seen it). Definitely one of the best Sci-Fi/Action movies ever made. Highly Entertaining!! 10/10" "A brilliant sci-fi parody, very underrated modern action film! Paul Verhoevens directing is superlative with great acting and one of the screens best vilians Clarence Bod icker. Should be on everyones top ten sci-fi lists!!!" "One of the most emotional action film you will ever see. Peter Weller portrays police officer Alex Murphy brutually murdered in one of the most violent scenes you are ever likely to see ( especially in the director's cut), and then brought back from the dead as Robocop. The only problem being that Robocop figures out who he really is and sets out to bring his own killers to justice. What sets Robocop apart is our genuine care for the hero. We really want him to win at the end. Weller truly portrays Robocop's humanity really well and quite touchingly. Whilst Kurtwood Smith plays one of the most hated villians I can recall. A real psycho who you cannot wait to see suffer at the hands of the man he killed . Add a great score to the mix and you have a really good movie. Be warned though , despite the fact that is told in a real comic book sense, it is far from a kid's movie. As a matter of fact it is one of the most violent movies I have ever scene." "The one thing I loved about this movie was how good the story was and how original it is. Some would think that it is a Terminator rip off but its far from it. In fact there are a few movie that sole idea's from this one. The whole thing with the perfect fighting machine made from scraps of a dead human was used again in Universal Soldier. And the idea of the soldiers having their bad memories come back and make them rebel is straight from Robocop. This is one of the many original idea's from this movie. Peter Weller was good as Robocop, but I think that Kurtwood Smith stole the show as the creepy bad guy Clarence Boddiker. The rest of the cast is good, and all in all this is one hell of a movie."

"This film has a lot of great things going for it. The directing is awesome, the story is very cool and quite interesting, the acting is top-notch, the action is non-stop, the comedy is well done and well placed, the make-up effects are incredible and the special effects are phenomenal! Paul Verhoeven is a very predictable director, but does a very good job and knows how to do things right! I say he's predictable because there are certain things that he loves to have in his films (i.e. strong violence and graphic scenes), but that isn't necessarily a bad thing, you just have to expect it when seeing his films. I think \"Robocop\" is my favorite Paul Verhoeven film to date (\"Total Recall\" being a close second). Everything in this film is done so well. Robocop is very well done and has a VERY impressive look to him. Not only Robocop, but ED-209 as well, WHAT AN AWESOME DESIGN!!! Peter Weller's portrayal of Robocop is superb as well. Peter does an excellent job of making robotic movements and his voice is very true to character. The rest of the cast was quite good as well, Nancy Allen, Ronny Cox, Kurtwood Smith and Miguel Ferrer deserve some extra notice. If you are a fan of science fiction / action films, then I strongly suggest you see this film! I can watch this film over and over and not get tired of it, it's just that good. I truly hope that you enjoy the film as much as I do. Thanks for reading, -Chris" "This film could have been a simple action flick, but it avoids that completely by having an intelligent plot, interesting lead character, and incredibly on-target satire of late 1980s trends. Although very violent, I can't really say it is gratuitious since the violence always serves the plot. A must-see, I rate it at 9." "A (very violent and) well-assembled action/science fiction thriller that's set in Detroit in the future where a corporate executive takes the remains of a cop, Murphy (Peter Weller) who was brutally murdered in the line of duty and turns him into RoboCop, a cyborg cop who has the marksmanship of Dirty Harry, the heart like Serpico, and the mind of his own. In return, the rebuilt cop goes after the thugs led by Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith) who literally left him for dead, riddled with gun shots and anyone who has ties with them. The film was directed by Paul Verhoeven, who became well-known for his early efforts like \"The Fourth Man\", and unfortunately, for \"Showgirls\" in the mid-nineties. What Verhoeven gives here isn't your typical thriller, it's one that has humor, courage, and most important, heart. Perhaps, the best moment in the movie is when the Weller character tells his concerned partner, Lewis (Nancy Allen) \"You may not like what you're about to see.\" and we see why. This movie also boasts an excellent musical score composed by Basil Poledouris and the special effects/make-up done by Rob Bottin add another benefit to the film." "Robocop is a great film. I had seen it many times when I was a kid, before I even fully understood and appreciated what films actually were. I believe Robocop has a bad reputation as a serious film because it was released at the time of so many other action and sci-fi films around at the time, and it seemed to be a contest as to who could outdo each other in the over the top stakes. The film has lasted so well for so long because it is a great story with a great concept. Just like in Blade Runner, the world that the film takes place in doesn't look so different as it is now, even though it is set sometime soon in the future. And it's certainly not impossible to imagine it couldn't turn out like Old Detroit. The film has also had an infamous reputation because of the violence. The film IS incredibly violent, especially in the unrated version, and for my money is the most so I've seen in American cinema. Murphy's death scene is pretty savage and seems to last forever if it's the first time you've seen it. It's also nicely paralleled with Robocop being gunned down by Lieutenant Hedgecock later on outside the OCP building, Hedgecock and Boddicker both working for Dick Jones. And poor Kinney, who gets shot to tatters by ED-209. The film also touches on other themes such as large multi-conglomerate corporations privatising public services and news broadcasts which relay constantly shocking news daily and perfectly delivered by their smiling anchor's, which seems more and more relevant each year. The score is surprisingly memorable and fits in very nicely whenever Robo is onscreen. For me this is Paul Verhoven's best film, and he never really got as close to something as good as this again, though he almost came close a few times." "I have been mostly rating the content of the movies, and not telling much about the story. This movie is hands down one of the best sci-fi movies around. I am the proud owner of the Criterion Collection director's cut. If you like this movie, this version is THE version to own. The director's cut contains what I feel is two of the greatest maimings ever filmed. You will know them when you see them. Rated R: strong bloody violence, language, and brief nudity. Unrated: intense graphic violence and gore, language, and brief nudity." "This is one of the most violent movies ever. My parents wouldn't let me rent it (I was 8 at the time) so I first saw it at a friends house. Seeing it again, after many years, I found this movie to be very entertaining. The effects are still quite amazing and I've always had a thing for robots. Highly thought provoking and cynical. And the musical accompaniment by Basil Pouledouris is amazing. 8/10" "Robocop was not only the first of Paul's movies I viewed, but also, by far the best. His infusion of the media with character development was fresh and innovative. He has continued to incorporate it within the frame work of his films, but none so poetically. If the majority of scifi movies were half as clever as this one; THERE WOULD BE TROUBLE. Beware. This movie is not for children; even though I saw it as a child and it seemed to be targeting the youth. Nothing like packaging ultraviolence for the kiddies. Ironic, but true. Many shots were attempted at expanding the original idea with as much success as an anorexic in a chocolate factory. At least the original exploited the stupidity of our love affair for violence; what followed just exploited our own tolerance for stupidity." "I see RoboCop as one of the truly great sci-fi films--a mix of cool technology, a dystopian future, a basic hero myth, and a thought-provoking commentary. Some people see The Terminator and RoboCop as two sides of the same coin; I'd say RoboCop is the mechanical monster movie with more of a satirical bent--and that's all to the credit of the smart script. Buried beneath Verhoeven's more-is-more filmmaking philosophy are simultaneous man vs. self and man vs. machine battles--but beneath THAT is a scathing social commentary on a future filled with media overexposure and consumerist overload. What a shame the limp sequels ditched the very premise (Man or machine? Human or product? If you take a brain out of the person, can you take the person out of the brain? Or, uh, something like that) that make RoboCop such a genre standout." "I've seen this film numerous times now and still it entertains me a lot. I really must say that Paul Verhoeven knows what he does (most of the time, for I haven't seen Showgirls (yet) and I thought The Hollow Man was not too good). But this really is a good, action film, which I must say has some pretty brutal scenes and that of course is one of the two things (brutality and a lot of skin) Verhoeven is notorious of and I must say I am not offended by it, I like it. It resembles how sick our society is. But this film does not only show us where we are, but also where we might be going. I mean look at those news broadcasts in the film. The newsreaders are barely (if at all) affected by what they tell us and the way the catastrophe's (cause it all is bad news) are cut in a way that is totally mechanic, without emotions of any kind. They go even further, they just throw in commercials in the middle of the news and not just any kind, commercials of the worst kind. Enough about what I think this movie is about and on to the stuff you care about. This movie is really good. I mean OK, some of the effects are not first class, but other things are. The story is good. The acting is good (except for Kurtwood Smith, who is a GOD as the ultimate mean motherfu..er), there are a few laughs (if you are sarcastic like me and the bad guys) plus there is a lot of action and brutality. Just about everything you need in a good movie. I know I do not say this often, but this really is a film for 16+ I think. 8 out of 10" "One of the best sci-fi movies on the 80's, chock full of political commentary, social and corporate mockery of Reagan-era society, and let's not forget a tough cyborg out for justice. ROBOCOP is the story of a murdered police officer who is \"resurrected\" throrugh the miracles of technology in the near future. Given a bullet-proof exoskeleton, he busts crime and heads in futuristic Detroit. However he soon finds out that he is not just a threat to criminals, but some of his superiors as well. Peter Weller is perfect as the part man, part machine crimefighter, and both Ronny Cox and Miguel Ferrier soar as dualing corporate execs Dick Jones and Bobby Morton vying for the coveted \"teacher's pet\" position with their company's CEO. But it's Kurtwood Smith's performance as Clarence Boddicker, the slick-as-ice gang leader who really steals the show. This film has a lot in common with HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER, and a good atmosphere to accompany it. It's also violent as hell, and is notorious for having extensive cuts to a few scenes. I still crank up the TV during the cocaine factory shootout, so I can get the full feel of the movie's fanfare mixed with Sam Peckinpah-inspired quick cuts of violence. Excellent scene! This is director Paul Verhoeven's best American film, and a great all around movie. The best thing about this film is the story, concerning a cyborg who wants to stay human, and if he can't be, he feels he owes his human half the justice he deserves. 9 stars. If you can stomach the gore and violence while focusing on the story, then you'll see why this is an awesome sci-fi action flick: wicked comic bookish style mixed with biting social commentary. A must for any action fan."

"Robocop worked for me on so many levels that it is still my personal pick for the best film of all time. As a science fiction film, it works because it suspends disbelief in a brilliant manner. It accomplishes this because it only has a single fantasy element - RoboCop. As a drama, it works so well because of, among other things, a score by Basil Poledouris that I can still picture the film going along in front of me when I listen to the music by itself. As a comedy, it works brilliantly because it spares no opportunity to take a shot at the attitude that destroyed America's industrial might, the \"who cares if it works, the people will buy what we make\" attitude. As an action film, it works because the entire style of the film is \"too much\", as Paul Verhoeven states eloquently during the commentary. One of the best elements for me was RoboCop himself. All of my life, people have been stealing things from me. The scummy fiends who passed themselves off as teachers during my childhood robbed me of any desire to formally educate myself. The child abusers who call themselves child psychologists stole years of my life with false statements and false reasoning. Ever since I saw this film in 1988, I wanted to be turned into a mechanised hulk so that I could make them pay by stealing their lives from them. Coupling this element with the corporate greed that leads to the creation of RoboCop is a gang led by Clarence, the most hyperactive and hyper violent villain I've seen in my life. If you added boobs to the guy, he would have perfectly resembled this schoolteacher I'd like to shoot apart in the same manner that the gang shoots Murphy apart. The manner in which he is killed by RoboCop had me standing up and clapping, it was executed so well, and so surprisingly. Where I am concerned, a Christ theme has to have three things. It has to have a likable protagonist, and this is something RoboCop delivers. It also has to have a multi-dimensional villain that I can identify with in spite of hating more than the Christian Coalition, and RoboCop delivers that as well. Lastly, it has to introduce and bind all its elements together in the most powerful manner possible. And RoboCop more than delivers. The scene in which RoboCop first walks into the police precinct is so well-realised that I still hear Ozzy Osbourne growling \"I am Iron Man!\" in my head whenever I watch it. Don't let the negative comments of those who don't understand the film fool you. As a man who studies literature and the English language like it is growing out of his ears, I can firmly tell you that this is the best Christ theme of the twentieth century, bar none. Rivalled only by the Star Wars saga, and successfully gripping in ways where The Matrix was just pathetic and hilarious, if you only ever see one film about justice, make it this one!" "I'm 15. I remember I had a tape of Robocop and I had been watching it for 7 years, but I didn't realize, at the time, that I had been watching the edited version the whole time. I didn't finally get a chance to see the uncut version until about 3 years ago. I have to admit that I had missed a lot during those 7 years. Boy I was in for a rude awakening when I watched this. Robocop has to be one of the violentist movies of the late 1980's. The scene where Murphy is murdered by Clarence and his thugs is absolutely horrific. The ED209 test scene is also horrific in a sense. Everything in Robocop is perfect. The cast, especially Kurtwood Smith's character is clearly an evil man, with no remorse or guilt for his ruthless actions and you know that his own demise will be very deserving. Peter Weller is the perfect choice for the unwilling and troubled Robocop who is haunted by the memories of his family as well as his own murder. 10/10" "STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs Having watched this unforgettable action/sci-fi classic again last time after at least 2 and a half years,I am still completely awed by it.There is'nt a level this masterpiece dos'nt work on.As an action movie,as an intelligent vision of the future (more intelligent and understandable than Blade Runner ever was,and imaginative too)and in terms of brilliantly written charecters.This film is nearly 15 years old,and still today,the special effects are as breathtakingly amazing as they were back then.They are utterly timeless.I certainly hope,in 2002,this film gets some kind of 15th anniversary celebration,like Fawlty Towers celebrated 25 years on UK Gold,maybe a re release on mainstream video for this one. Another thing I came to decide having seen this again,was that all the spin offs from it,the two sequels and the TV series,were for losers.Yes,accept no imitations,this is the definitive,only version of Robocop.Take no notice of the rest of that crap,this now glares out to me as the one main,most important instance where they should have just left the original how it is.*****" "\"RoboCop\" was a major surprise for me when I saw it back in 1987. I didn't think this was going to be all that great. It looked ugly and grimy, and usually movies that look ugly and grimy turn me off. I saw it, and I was glad because this movie took me by surprise. \"RoboCop\" is a very entertaining (and very violent) science fiction/action/thriller that works on just about every level. Peter Weller stars as Alex Murphy, a cop in the city of Old Detroit who gets killed in the line of duty by some truly hateful criminals. Afterwards he is brought back to life, but not as a normal human being. The evil corporation OCP that runs all the police departments have turned this man into RoboCop, part man, part machine. They feel that since crime rate is at an absolute high (and since their earlier robotic experiment ED-209 was a big violent flop), RoboCop is the answer to stop it. And boy does he ever. However there's a little twist in between all the violence. He still has memories of when he was Murphy, and remembers the creeps who killed him. With the help of his partner Lewis (played wonderfully by Nancy Allen), they go after the bad guys. The two main villains in the film give brilliant performances. Veteran character actor Ronny Cox had his first nasty role here as Dick Jones, the #2 guy at the OCP department who creates ED-209 and becomes mad as hell when a younger OCP executive creates RoboCop after the ED-209 experiment fails; and Kurtwood Smith gives one of the meanest performances of all-time as Clarence Bodicker, the leader of the evil gang that kills Murphy. It's really hard to believe that a decade after playing this memorably evil bad guy, Smith would go on to do comedy on the current TV sitcom \"That 70's Show\". As for the other performances, Weller is perfect in the lead, Allen has one of her best film roles as the sidekick, Miguel Ferrer is very good as Morton, RoboCop's creator, Robert DoQui is very funny as Sgt. Reed (the boss at police headquarters where Murphy/RoboCop works at), and Daniel O'Herlihy has a nice small part as the head of OCP who is known to everyone as the Old Man. \"RoboCop\" was Dutch director Paul Verhoeven's first American movie, and it's a winner. One of the things that he does here that really makes the film work is the sense of humor that he put into it. Even though \"RoboCop\" is brutally violent at times, it's also brutally hilarious. I laughed a lot while watching this movie, and that was the biggest surprise for me. But the main reason to see \"RoboCop\" are the action and special effects sequences, and they're terrific. The film is ugly and grimy at times which I expected, but in the long run, it didn't bother me. \"RoboCop\" is so well-made that I didn't care if it looked bleak. This is an excellent movie. And forget about the two sequels that followed. Neither \"RoboCop 2\" or \"RoboCop 3\" came close to matching the excitement, humor, and thrills of the original. ***1/2 (out of four)" "Wow, I love this movie so much. I just bought the Criterion DVD edition and it is worth every penny. Lots of cool extras (audio commentary, storyboards, etc) and the violent scenes are now uncut bloodier and more gruesome than before! This is my favorite film Paul Verhoeven has made, with Total Recall as a close #2. Hidden underneath all the ultra-violence and comic-book-style special effects there is a brilliant satire of what America was about in the 1980s. The acting very underrated as each actor gives a colorful performance which suits their characters perfectly. Ronny Cox plays a great villan and I can't understand why he is never used much in other movies. The entire cast is great. Peter Weller is the perfect choice to play Robocop. The music score and sound are done very well, and a real treat to experience on a home theater system. One of my favorite movies, and one of the best Science Fiction movies I've ever seen. They just don't make movies like this anymore and forget about the sequels to this too." "Robocop is Paul Veherhoven at his finest. The movie is not for the faint of heart. It is a gory, gritty, and very powerful movie that is both visually stunning and emotionally draining. The violence in this movie is intense. There are some scenes that will cause some people to cringe. However, underneath Robocop are some powerful messages about society, the media, business, crime, and identity. Dick Jones says \"Good business is where you find it.\" A laughable premise in such a violent movie, until you realize that many businesses behave no differently than the crooks in this movie." "When Robocop premiered in Copenhagen, released in what was - and still is - Denmark´s biggest cinema (the Imperial), the reviews where to some extent furious. One even cried out, -The stinkiest of movies on Copenhagen´s largest screen! I, however, had the thrill of my life. Now I´m not a violent man - as a matter of fact far from it - I couldn´t harm a fly. But this film, despite it´s over-use of graphic violence, grabbed me by the you know what and held me firmly to the seat. For the last decade or so I´ve seen it perhaps 20 times, and it still amazes me how Verhoeven has managed to put a film together that has a lot to say - beneath the surface of ultraviolence. Especially the news - and commercial spots are todays classics, and to make matters worse, some of it´s prophecies almost happen these days. The pace is excellent, filming by Jost Vacano is clearly innovative and Basil Poledouris´ score is superb. When it comes to stop-animation it might be goofy-looking today, but at the time of release it was state of the art. And given the fact that Peter Weller is actually convincing as metallic monster you might even talk about good acting. I could go on and on, but then I would begin to bore you. However, Verhoeven probably had no idea he made what became an all time SciFi-classic, but the sequel (Tom Noonan is OK) and in particular the third Robocop do no more good than a one-legged man in an a** kicking contest. Maybe my mind is a mess - Robocop ranks in my over-all top 3.and it has to be considered a clean 10." "It is simply impossible to criticise this film. It is totally efficient and without a single flaw in any aspect. The plot is beautifully constructed, goes at breakneck pace, and is filled with stunning set pieces. The script is witty, very quotable (\"Stay out of trouble\") and it doesn't let a single line go to waste. The amazing shiny, metallic special effects invoke a vision of the future in which capitalism is rampant - remember this was before the Berlin Wall fell and Communism collapsed. It is totally plausible. This could have just been a straightforward action movie, but Verhoeven has turned it into a revenge thriller, a quest for identity, a parallel of Jesus' death-and-rebirth (at one stage Murphy walks on water) and a hilarious comedy rolled into one." "... Or, Paul Verhoeven conquers the world. More people have seen RoboCop than probably any other film by him, and his genius is that he can work in big-budget genres and never stoop to thinking that he ought to be more responsible. RoboCop is funny, violent, clever and moving. No sane person would ever want to _watch_ a sequel, let alone make one. People accuse Verhoeven of crypto-fascism, in that he never seems to offer some sort of \"positive\" alternative to the nightmare worlds he portrays. But he says, and I agree with him, that he's just being realistic. A great film. He didn't make another one as good until Starship Troopers." "Robocop's vision of the future is somewhat dark and gritty but proves to be a most enjoyable tale of Alex Murphy (Peter Weller), the good cop who gets killed in the line of duty. Only to be reborn as a high tech tool of justice. This is the first of what have become the more memorable Paul Verhoeven films and definitely the best of the Robocop series. His almost trade mark use of blood and excessive violence is evident here and often leaves you wincing in sympathetic pain for the characters on screen, you honestly start felling sorry for some of them. The movie works well on a number of levels and proves to be a highly entertaining action film with just a hint of something higher at work. As an action film it is highly successful, it provides witty one liners and makes for excellent bang for your buck. But as a social satire it also functions, it makes a healthy stab at the values we are adopting in out lives. As Science Fiction it is one of the more enjoyable outings of the late eighties. It is interesting to note the characters in this a clever little film. Most of the human characters seem shallow, yet logically the most shallow character (Robocop) seems to be the only human element in the film. The movie follows a pretty predictable story line, boy makes good, boy goes out for revenge, boy is framed, boy comes back as a hero despite all odds. Despite the lack of a surprising story, it is still is a highly entertaining film, providing as many gasps as laughs and leaves you at the end of it thinking `Hell I wanna be a Robot!' It is however interesting to note that yes old Robo is cased in Titanium, practically invincible to the oncoming onslaught of bullets and other things nasty that no one thinks to shoot him in the mouth. Its not like he's moving too fast for them to do this. I wonder perhaps if he also has Titanium teeth."

"Robocop is not a film I was keen to see. I am not a big fan of action movies, especially when they forsake story and characters for yet more special effects. So, the prospect of watching a cyborg hero shooting his way through villains in futuristic Los Angeles left me rather unimpressed. However, when I finally saw the film, it blew me away. Robocop is a wolf in a sheep's skin. It is a satire written for people who hate satires. Most people who'll see this film won't even notice. Robocop is Paul Verhoeven's 'Modern Times', but it is much subtler in delivering its message than Chaplin. Superficially we are given a vision of the future, a bleak future with rampant crime and rampant capitalism. It is not an entirely consistent vision, as advances/changes in science and society are immense while people still seem to wear the same clothes, live in the same houses, go to the same shops, drive the same cars as they did in 1987. Well, it is 1987. We are not shown the future at all, we are shown a caricature of today, we see the present through the eyes of a cartoonist. Robocop works perfectly well as an action flick and it delivers all the cliches we expect; since it has more humour than your average special effects bonanza it is very entertaining to watch. What makes it special though is the social comment beneath the surface." "In a dystopia future, crime ridden Detroit is being protected by a police force run by Omni Consumer Products. Omni is looking to replace inner city Detroit with Delta City. They want to clean up the crime with new robotic cops. When the latest robot ED 209 malfunctions, they need RoboCop as the backup plan. Officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is new in the dangerous precinct, and he's paired up with the rough Officer Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen). In a wild chase with master criminal Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith), Alex is captured and seriously tortured. When he dies, Omni takes ownership of his body to create RoboCop. This is great 80s sci-fi action. It is fun. The FX is good for the 80s. The cheese factor is high, but it's never ridiculous. RoboCop looks super cool. I wish they had better CGI back then, and better production value. Sometimes the action looks light. The production design lacks imagination with the exception of RoboCop and ED 209. There are good fun actors especially Miguel Ferrer and Ronny Cox. Miguel is great as the sleazy corporate climber. The story has just enough dark social commentary." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Dead or alive, you're coming with me. In the future Detroit is overrun with crime to the point that the police department has become aligned(albeit reluctantly)with a technological corporation known as OCP who are planning to rebuild the city \"for the better\", to provide better homes and increase employment across the board. They are also in the process of creating robotic police officers to replace human ones and decrease the rate of crime. Dick Jones(a ruthless Ronny Cox)is VP to \"the old man\", head of OCP(Dan O'Herlihy), but loses his position when a giant robot his division had been working on \"has a glitch\" which results in the murder of an employee during a presentation. The eager Bob Morton(Miguel Ferrer portraying his usual asshole)swoops in to present a robotic creation of his own, due to appear as soon as he can get the right kind of \"parts\" to assimilate the \"new breed of cop\". That happens when a police officer, Murphy(Peter Weller), is crucified(director Verhoeven claims in an interview that he wanted the cop's brutal murder to mirror Jesus Christ's own death)by a vicious drug lord, Clarence J Boddicker(a repulsive Kurtwood Smith)and his gang(including Ray Wise and Paul McCrane). His partner, Anne(a deglammed Nancy Allen), sees this horrifying development and later recognizes that parts of him had been used for OCP's Robocop(mainly his face and brain and perhaps some internal organs shielded by armor). This is what Bob proudly unveils--a robotic, programmed police officer designed to apprehend suspects and follow directives assigned to him through OCP. So is the plot where Robocop dutifully goes out to halt crimes in progress--a rape, liquor store robbery, gas station robbery, Robocop steps in as an avenger with a badge, but something happens that Bob and his scientists didn't anticipate. Murphy, somehow, remains active despite a \"brain sweep\" and bits of humanity emerge, memories(particularly of those who murdered him)resurface, giving Robocop an incentive to pursue those who killed the man he once was. Secretly Jones and Boddicker are actually in cahoots, first eliminating a thorn in their side, Bob, and soon focusing on getting rid of Robocop. Will these heathens be successful or will Murphy get his revenge? Through Verhoeven's superb direction(the way he stages the action scenes, interspersing live action with stop motion effects, not to mention, the camera-work and overall pacing and style), a wicked, witty, razor-sharp script(the satire on commercialism, materialistic society, and dangers of potential technological breakthroughs placed in the hands of the wrong people) , really vile villains worthy of destruction(Murphy's sadistic demise makes him quite the worthy figure of sympathy), and awe-inspiring depictions of Robocop(and especially Ed 209)at work--along with the magnificent make-up and Robocop design by Rob Bottin, as well as, Basil Poledouris' rousing, stirring score--this action-packed, ultra-violent sci-fi extravaganza has stood the test of time. I think it's just as riveting a sci-fi action flick as THE TERMINATOR, it's brother so to speak. There's plenty of acidic humor which deftly matches the overall tone of the film, it's a dangerous world out there, both in the boardroom and on the streets. Phil Tippett and his stop motion team do a phenomenal job with Ed 209, with Verhoeven and company amazingly able to effectively have the giant robot occupy the same screen as human characters. The highlight for me, besides the human atomic monster splattered across a car, would be the battle between Robocop and Ed 209 inside OCP headquarters, the building taking as much damage as the combating robots." "This one goes for the jugular. Verhoeven has never exactly had a reputation for the light, the family friendly, or holding back in criticism. As one of his satires, this is quite simply excellent and utterly ferocious, in its depiction of society and big business... of the future. Yes, that's it. The writing is marvelous. The dialog is endlessly quotable. The characters are credible and portrayed well. The gritty, and sometimes intentionally over-the-top tone is masterfully achieved, and lasts for the entire duration. The action is incredible, and all memorable. The suit is amazing. The special effects are extremely well-done, with a handful of exceptions, most having to do with limitations of the time. The symbolism is exceptional. Consider what not to take at face value in this. As with other of Paul's works, bring your brain for this one, if for absolutely no other reason, remember it says \"sci-fi\" as a genre, also. Be aware that there are fairly gruesome and disturbing things in this, some would call it downright distasteful, most notably in the violence and themes, and \"intense\" isn't exactly a wrong word to associate with this. The Parents Guide on here can help let you know what to expect, if such bothers you. There is also a little nudity, and plenty of language. I recommend this to any fan of science fiction, any of the actors(Kurtwood Smith can be a bad-ass), of clever films, and of the concept. 8/10" "This is the first installment of the Robocop movies and I to this day still love it. The story is very well done and for 1987, a little ahead of it's time. The concept of Robocop is intelligently written. The setup is Detroit. The city is overrun by crime and the police are so concerned with it that showing up at work could be their last day in ever. This filming is so well done that you, the viewer feel like you are a part of this depressing and worn out police station. I won't go into details any further, but the acting is solid, the story is well done, and the villains are SO nasty that you will really hate them. If your a squeamish one, be careful. This movie is pretty damn violent. The Last Word: This is a solid and fun ride. Still remains a classic, just avoid the sequels." "Robocop has to be one of the most perfect and flawless transitions of sci-fi concepts/comics/cartoons into a real motion picture. While those are normally recipies for disaster, for once it actually looks better and luck may have even played a huge part given how the concept fits perfectly. The movie is not all about action either and has a huge emotional element to it. Plenty of surprises and an excellent plot await if you have not already seen this movie. The special effects are as well developed as those times allowed. Unfortunately, the sequels have been highly disappointing. Even the TV series cannot touch this and may even kill interest in this franchise." "Robocop is the most violent movie ever made. Taxi Driver has to be next. The first time I saw this movie I was about 14. Now that I am a little older I understand it more. I bought the movie in its unrated version and I noticed how much they cut out. This movie was cut to avoid an X rating. Now I have the cut version again. The thing I like about getting the R rated and unrated versions are comparing the two. I think Peter Weller does a good job as Alex Murphy. Also Nancy Allen does a good job also as his partner. Ronny Cox is the best villain. I think the commercials are hilarious. I think Total Recall is more violent than this is." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "It starts out interesting enough Two cops, Murphy (Peter Weller) and Lewis (Nancy Allen), take off in pursuit some crooks in a moderately well-done car chase. Murphy and Lewis catch up to them in a warehouse. They separate, and Lewis is forced to watch as they almost obliterate her partner. She gets him to a hospital where he is clinically pronounced dead. Meanwhile, OCP, the company that provides most of the funding and technology to law enforcement agencies has developed a new Cyborg project, and as you may suspect, Murphy becomes their first test subject. The brazenness of the film is tempered with the director's care to take the material seriously. So while the dialog is a bit cheesy and the criminals are highly exaggerated, the plot does not suffer. More attention could've been given to character writing, but that fails to scar the film. The set design as well as Robocop's suit and armor are superlative for its time, and the music is well-scored and apposite for each scene. The design of ED-209 was also considerably advanced for its time, and the further personification of it added some light humor, especially when it fell down the stairs. The art department did a incredible job with Emil's (Paul McCrane) skin meltingit was surprisingly realistic. However, the latter squirting blood almost made me laugh out loud. I guess ya win some, ya lose some. Despite the fact that Weller (Robocop) is limited in his acting since he plays a Cyborg, you still feel his loneliness and isolation. Lewis recognizing him and helping him was handled well. Furthermore, you can really feel the injustice of it all in the scene in the garage when all the cops open fire on him. I wish it was explained more what parts of him are human and what is Cyborg, but I suppose one can infer this from his actions. The Old Man (Dan O'Herlihy) firing Dick thus enabling Robocop to kill him was niceI actually didn't see it coming. And the last scene where The Old Man asks RoboCop his name gave the film closure. VERDICT: The performances are nothing special to behold, but even now, it is *still* abundantly clear that this film set a milestone for its time, and can be appreciated as such. Recommended to all, whether you're in search of an original futuristic film or just looking for something to pass the time. 7.0 out of 10.0" "If you're a man and you have not seen RoboCop, you might as well not have a penis. One simply cannot describe themselves as men unless this movie has been viewed by their own eyes...and enjoyed. I say that because RoboCop is a film made just for men, a great one at that, and if you haven't seen it then there's something seriously wrong with you. And if you have seen it and don't like it, you could possibly be a woman, have a hormonal imbalance causing a lack of testosterone, or are a serious steroid juicer. Either way, it comes down to the penis and or lack thereof. Don't let it go to waste by not enjoying this movie. Respect it. Now that that's out of the way, let's get to the damn film shall we? RoboCop has everything an essential action movie needs, violence, destruction, guns, an evil antagonist (played marvelously by Kurtwood Smith), and of course the classic one-liners. The film exceeds above the rest in the same genre because of a slick script and good direction...not to mention just one kickass idea to start with. Some of the effects have aged, particularly the animation sequences featuring the Godsend of man-movie villains, the ED-209. Although they have aged, naturally, I don't feel that it takes away from the film. And let's face it, the ED-209 is just bad. I would love to have one for myself, you know, for simple entertainment purposes. hmmm. I'll just leave it at that just because I don't want any G-men showing up at my door. I would not be too quick to label this film as clichéd either. It was made in the '80s, where almost all action and sci-fi clichés were created, so one must not take too much away from the film simply because of this fact. All in all, an excellent film, even if it is a simple action flick. Not only that, this film was a trend setter in it's day...this fact cannot be denied. The hand scene alone, although ultra-violent and simple, is something that will never be forgotten. And now that we have the wonderful technology of DVD's, one can now watch this beloved scene in slow motion. Sometimes I think things are invented and created just for me. But then again, maybe I have problems. Overall, RoboCop is an excellent action/sci-fi film that set the stage for films the come. And although it's still a simple action flick, it is a definite unique, creative, and well-made one. I highly recommend this film to any man with a penis." "On his first day out on the streets of Detroit, Officer Murphy is brutally killed by known thug leader, Clarence Boddicker. Scientists at OCP are able to use what remains of Murphy's body and build a new heavily armed cyborg police officer, one that could rid the streets of crime forever. Paul Verhoeven has been called many things in his career, bonkers, challenging and visionary, here with his first perceived block buster American feature, he showcases all of those things. Robocop on the page {and with its title} looked like your average run of the mill sci-fi shoot them up, with its basic premise not exactly oozing originality either. But Verhoeven had screenwriter's Edward Neumeier & Michael Miner in his corner, and they came up with a superior script to fully realise his vision. That Robocop is a satirical critique of totalitarianism and corporate corruption is now a given. Yet it wasn't at first evident to the summer block buster crowd, but Robocop has stood up well to critical re-examinations and the depth digging that so many have afforded it. So with the script he wanted in place, Verhoeven utilised his memories from childhood, where his Netherlands home was taken over by a stomping German army, and added in the destruction factor, with no amount of technical expertise as well. Verhoeven paints an unhinged portrait of this Detroit {actual location shoot was parts of Texas}, with skew whiff angles and bizarre twists lining the picture, the special effects even today looking tremendous. Robocop is extremely violent, especially in the directors cut that's now widely available, but even during the most wincing scenes, it stays brisk and sparky, and on his side is that his characters are as inhuman as the title protagonist is!. Thus the fusion of berserker sci-fi and human realism sits easy with the viewer, with the result serving notice to what a fine director Verhoeven can be. Peter Weller dons the Robo suit {enduring agony for weeks on end apparently} and does what is required, and Nancy Allen kicks buttocks as Murphy's partner, Anne Lewis. But it's with the unsavoury characters that Robocop gains its acting kudos. Ronny Cox, Miguel Ferrer and a wickedly vile Kurtwood Smith dominate proceedings, helped immeasurably by the nature of the script. Verhoeven is thought to be a hard character on set, demanding much from all involved, even driving the normally amiable Weller to thoughts of violence against his director. But few, if any of those involved in Robocop can now say the final result wasn't worth it, because between them they made a genre classic. 9/10" "Add another review" "Find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your Watchlist and rate your favorite movies and TV shows on your phone or tablet!")("Movies, TV & Showtimes" "Celebs, Events & Photos" "News & Community" "Watchlist" "" "Find industry contacts & talent representation" "Manage your photos, credits, & more" "Showcase yourself on IMDb & Amazon" "Sign in with Facebook Other Sign in options" "Own the rights?" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "For a movie that is 30 years old, the social commentary is still great. Its got commercials for fake futuristic products, the fun of crazy action sequences, and one of my all-time favorite robots/droids in ED- 209. ED-209 is great and I wish someone made a small one that really interacted with you without telling me it was going to shoot me then actually shooting me. I don't need toys that murder. Peter Weller is great and the supporting cast is equally astounding. In watching this with the commentary I was shocked at how much thought went in to each scene. My only concern would be how violent and hard-R rated it is. I will have to wait until my children are at least 5 to watch it (just kidding)." "I've watched this about a million times and I liked it. I loved the action scenes including the shoot out in the factory. I like the special effects with ED-209 and Robocop. The commercials in this film made it a bit humorous. I used to have a Robocop action figure but it doesn't work anymore and it's lost. That's the reason why I like Robocop." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Robocop 1987 Robocop is a film I hold very close to my heart. As a school boy when this film was released my father wouldn't allow me to watch it. The graphic violence and foul language was deemed unfit for an eleven year old boy and rightly so. I begged and pleaded but dad wouldn't budge. His mind was set. My school friends however had all seen it. I don't think there was a VHS copy in my neighbourhood that hadn't been played within an inch of its life. Of course every school break time was filled with discussion of this sci-fi masterpiece. So I learned the film from start to finish without even laying my eyes on the screen. Every line, every scene all in my imagination as I listened in awe to my friends as they retold the tale of Alex Murphy a Detroit police officer who is violently gunned down by a gang of vicious criminals and then reconstructed as a crime fighting cyborg. I say violently but even that is an understatement. If you opt to watch the directors cut the gore of Murphy's deconstruction is almost too much to bare. Limbs are detached from body with murderous gunfire. The violence feels real, you can almost taste the brain matter. But this is necessary in order to convey the brutal world these characters live in. Paul Verhoevens film pokes fun at modern day America and the massive corporations that control our lives. All of this is done with a good dose of satire and a wink at the camera. The TV commercials that play throughout the movie are a work of genius. A particular one involving a gas guzzling American made car named the 6000 SUX, an American tradition which proudly returns 8.2mpg. There are so many delights in this film that are wasted on an eleven year old school boy. However when my father finally came around some few years later and allowed me to watch this movie I was blown away like Murphy himself. My imagination was being presented before me right there on the screen. I knew every line but to see it actually happening was mesmerising. The performances are exceptional, particularly by Peter Weller as Robocop. His movement, his on screen presence. A story of a man becoming a machine and then a man again perfectly portrayed. Supporting cast are also superb. Kurtwood Smith created one of the most evil and memorable villains since Darth Vader. Granted the special effects by today's standards look weak but compared to the recent remake, the original film has depth and texture. No CGI can replicate this. Take ED209 for example he is as menacing as he is comical. A killer robot tank that is flummoxed by a staircase. The clumsy stop motion effects only elevate this. I recently revisited this film and after thirty years I am still bowled over by its genius. Robocop is more than just an action flick it's a clever and comical finger poke at the world we live in." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This is one of the most clever and influential pieces, not just for science-fiction, but film as a whole. I can explain the sudden drop in ratings. It's ignorant people rating this down because they're confusing it with the 2014 film. That is a remake of this film. Watch this film and culture yourselves." "One thing I don't think I ever hear mentioned about \"RoboCop\" is the sound design. His movements and footsteps sound fantastic, and they're as unique as the sound of a proton pack, lightsaber or time- traveling DeLorean. It's one of the many reasons this is such an enduring movie. \"RoboCop\" is so effective because it strikes the precise balance between human drama and the comic book outrageous. It's got everything: memorable villains, great score, mid-'80s ultra-violence, cheap (hysterical) jabs at corporate America and a delightfully glib outlook on the media. Seriously, absorb just five minutes of present-day cable news, and suddenly those Media Break segments seem all too real. I think that's more unnerving than how the movie presaged the woeful state of Detroit. There's a real heart to this movie, which is why it's one of my all-time favorites. The idea that a corporation can own anything from the police to an entire city - but not a man's soul. I dunno, even after all of the bloodspray and beautiful matte paintings, what really brings a smile to my face is the main character's utterance of his own name in the closing moments. I mean, really, does it get any better than that? 10/10" "The ads in this movie are hilarious, a very nice unexpected touch. They're not explained but fit in with the tone and are perfect as comic relief. The movie clearly has a sense of irony and exaggeration about it. The violence is over-the-top. Cops are getting killed left and right. No character is safe from getting hurt. The story keeps moving so it's easy to be engaged the whole time. Robocop is like the perfect boy's movie except it's too violent for kids. It's loaded with testosterone. It's got guns, cars, goodies and baddies, explosions, blood, shoot-outs, chases, angry old guys shouting, a giant robot and Robocop himself. It's only missing hot women in terms of the male fantasy. Whatever we watch action films for, Robocop has a good amount of it. Many parts were exciting to watch and made me laugh or at least smile a lot. The robot, ED-209, is extremely cool. The stop-motion animation is jumpy but detailed and effective and the sound-effects and mean voice are intimidating. You really feel his presence. I'm sure I would instantly drop to the ground and wet my pants if he threatened me :) Robocop himself has an interesting aura around him. He's like a superhero. The other police are curious about him. He's tall and moves mechanically but appears friendly and reliable. Against criminals, he's efficient and apparently indestructible. We're not sure how human or awake or alive he is but that gets developed throughout the movie in a satisfying way. I would have liked to see a sequel except they aren't meant to be very good. Like Spider-man and Batman, his relationship with society and the police is rocky. Sometimes he's respected and looked up to. Other times there is fear and distrust. This movie is violent and dark but still manages to be fun and entertaining. It's not too grim and has a sense of humour about itself. Many of the characters are jerks and we basically celebrate when they get killed. They're archetypes of the kinds of people everyone hates. The bad guys are hilariously 1-dimensional. What I like is how Robocop cuts straight to the point. Everything about a person is obvious from the start. There may be little twists or surprises but at least we know where people's hearts are. The swearing is particularly refreshing and enjoyable. It's such an efficient way to express feelings which is used appropriately and to great effect here. Robocop gives hope to a city that's halfway to hell. There is a nice human element. The ongoing struggle between the police and criminals. The camaraderie they each have among themselves. Like Batman, Robocop is shaking things up which some people like and some don't. I didn't like the first two X-men movies because they were stupid and yet took themselves so seriously. They weren't fun. Robocop doesn't make that mistake. It doesn't pretend to be anything more than a story about this awesome cop-robot-thing going around killing bad guys. And yet, because of its irony and fearlessness, there are plenty of ideas that come up throughout this movie. Can we trust an armed machine to enforce the law? Will that happen in the future? How much risk is acceptable? Is the news anything more than mere entertainment? The male reporter seems to smile the whole time in this movie. Is it ever moral to kill? And why are men obsessed with big guns and cars (other than them being inherently awesome)?" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "From a visceral standpoint a heck of a good movie. Revenge from Murphy for his murder by the thugs, the return of at least some humanity to Robocop from Nancy Allen. When Robocop goes in to the drug lab he is looking for the ones who \"killed\" him. He takes out I don't know how many of them, goes after the number two man, Dick Jones, at OCP. This is where directive four comes in to play, any attempt to arrest a senior OCP officer will lead to shut down. Going to arrest the smarmy faced Dicky Robocop overcomes the shut down, encounters the Robocop upgrade, goes to the basement where the upgrade can not handle the stairs, gets the crap shot out of him by human cops, is rescued by Nancy Allen. Kurtwood Smith is really good as the A hole crime thug. I love it when he gets his. Nancy Allen brings Robo tools, food, and weapons. Getting some military grade weapons the thugs go after Robo thinking they have the upper hand. I guess they forgot to read the script. They get picked off one by one but of course Kurty runs away, Nancy chases, he crashes and is finally killed. So Robo goes to arrest the Dickey but can't until he is fired. Gee guess what happens now? Dicky not only gets shot to pieces but is blown out a very high window." "In futuristic Detroit, an honest police officer (Peter Weller) is gunned down by a ruthless gang. His body is turned into a robot to be used by the police force. He now makes a cop who is physically tough, has myriad other features like precision targeting and recording statements from criminals and is dedicated to his job. He is an immediate success but what happens when he detects corruption and crime among his superiors. The more realistic a character is the more they elicit the right kind of emotions in the audience, be it like or dislike. That's the reason why we like the villains in superhero flicks; they are not real by any stretch of imagination. RoboCop is similar to a superhero but his rivals are not super villains. They are real people; people with power. They do pose the threat of taking over the city/world because they already own half the city. Their motives are multi-layered and complex. The stakes are high as RoboCop may or may not win the day. And all this leads up to one of the most emotionally intense, action-packed climaxes ever put on cinema. The character of RoboCop has been delicately dealt with. The differences and similarities in his human and robot personalities, the reactions of people towards him, his discovery of his origins and the internal conflict he goes through all feel real. The supporting characters are meaty and well cast. Peter Weller himself does a good job considering he is wearing a heavy costume and his eyes are covered with a helmet for most part of the movie. There is a lot of 80's feel to it for a movie set in the future and some of the effects look dated. But that is just nitpicking as they are not distracting in the least bit." "Paul Verhoeven wanted to implant a Jesus like feeling to the whole notion of being reborn and there are visual clues to that (walking on water and so on). Of course no one would think of Jesus coming back in a violent fashion like that. So it's not a clear cut comparison or analogy for that matter. The violence in the movie is extreme and there are certain scenes you will not forget that easily (and the effects are still holding up). The \"you have 20 seconds to comply\" scene in particular is more than (in)famous. But its also the performance by Peter Weller that carries that story. His relationships with his Ex-Partner and the strange mix of human and robot is more than appealing. A great movie that did stand the test of time" "To me, there is no movie that can compare to such an astonishing, unique, motivating film like this one. Honestly, this movie is the real definition of a movie with a true morality. Robocop truly grasps an unforgettable story that will make you want to repeat this movie in your head endlessly until it's the last memory that you will ever remember. This movie will forever be engraved in my heart and I tend to visualize this movie in my head from time to time. I will never forget such a magnificent film like this one. Robocop is truly an emotional, awe-inspiring movie that just can't be forgotten in such little time. Not only does this film have an amazing storyline to it, but it also has a spectacular cast with amazing acting. This beautiful film will forever be acknowledged by me and I will always love Robocop until death."

"There's no other way of saying it, but Robocop is an absolute classic. Ignore the 'so-so' 2014 remake and concentrate on the original. It's all you need. It was possibly too good and couldn't even be matched by its sequels. Yes, it's hyper-violent and totally adult in nature, but it also has a wonderfully subtle layer of satire underneath all the gore and bloodshed. In case you don't know, a policeman is gunned down in futuristic Detroit, only to be resurrected with no memory of his former life as an indestructible cyborg lawman. Of course his memories soon start to trickle back and he begins to want to track down those who 'killed' him for more than just a slap on the wrist. It's packed full of memorable scenes and catchphrases and the only people who probably won't appreciate this film are those with a real distaste for violence. It really is the perfect little film for what it is. It never tries to be deep and meaningful, only loud, proud and entertaining. And it succeeds of ever one of those levels. http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "I was about seven or eight, when My Mom picked this movie up at one my town's local video stores. Immediately after watching it, I loved it, and on subsequent returns to that video store, I had to incessantly beg my mother to re- rent it for me. Ever since the day I first watched the film, it has been one of my favorite movies. The idea of RoboCop isn't particularly new, many movies, comic books, pulp magazines, short stories, and TV shows, have had more or less the same plot. However RoboCop takes it in a new direction. The plot is this: Things have gone to hell in Detroit, and a mega-corporation known as Omni Consumer Products or O.C.P., has taken control. Crime runs rampant all over the city, and one of the head members of O.C.P., must somehow find a solution to this problem. We then meet the main character: Officer Alex Murphy, who has just transferred to the roughest part of the city. Murphy and his new partner: Officer Anne Lewis, hear of a bank robbery that was committed by a local street gang. Murphy and Lewis pursue them to their hideout. The two police officers get separated, and Murphy is then cornered by the gang members and brutally shot to death. Sometime later, Murphy is resurrected by O.C.P. as the crime fighting cyborg, RoboCop! At first, Murphy has no knowledge or recollection of his life or of his family, but slowly his memories return, and RoboCop/Murphy must rediscover his humanity and seek vengeance for his brutal murder. RoboCop not only has stellar acting, outstanding special effects, but also an excellent and compelling story. This film has one of the most memorable scores, and a brilliant use of satire with its clever \"commercials\". Without a doubt, it is one of the best science- fiction films of all time, and definitely one of the best films to come out of the eighties. Check it out, and see it for yourself!" "One of the pioneers of cyberpunk genre where we look a few decades into the future into a world where crime and corruption rule and its up to few dedicated people to make the difference. RoboCop has earned the reputation of a classic because of its style and harsh satirical critique on modern society and its downfalls. It mocks the modern conventions of trying to make as much money as possible without caring about the end result. It also deals with the themes of identity, corruption, humanity and heroism. And throughout it all it's also a really good action film with blazing gun fights, brutal massacres and lovely special effects - especially for their time. One of the best things about this film is the role performance delivered by Peter Weller, the RoboCop himself. We don't get to see much of his face or expressions because of the helmet, but his voice alone is enough to carry the emotions and feelings he goes through. Even his robotic monotone has enough depth to make us feel for him and whenever a hint of emotion seeps through, it feels like a victory to both him and the viewer. RoboCop is one of those movies that need to be seen for the full experience to sink in. Its plot isn't overly complex, but it's the way the story is told that's important. The little touches. If you're a fan of science fiction or societal satire, then this one is definitely a movie for you." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "I bet it must be a lot of fun working with Paul Verhoeven, so long as you don't mind getting messy! In the 80s, his sci-fi/ action thrillers were some of the most imaginative shows out there. Along with the original TOTAL RECALL, the original ROBOCOP is his best work! And when you went to see one, what would you expect to see? Usually good guys battling bad guys, winding up in some pretty bloody fights. Characters in Verhoeven's films didn't so much get dead as get massacred! Anyway, now that I'm through with my little rant, let's get on to reviewing 1987's ROBOCOP. In some distant future, the city of Detroit has become a violent haven for criminals. Despite the best efforts of the police department, cops become casualties almost on a nightly basis. One morning, Alex Murphy (played expertly by Peter Weller) comes into work, having been transferred from a kinder, gentler precinct. He meets his new partner, Lewis (Nancy Allen) and before you know it, they are chasing after a van of criminals led by mad dog crime boss Clarence Boddicker (played icily by Kurtwood Smith). Following the criminals to their hideout, the cops get separated and Murphy dies in one of the most violent death scenes in movie history. Meanwhile, the head honchos at Omni Consumer Products (OCP, COP, get it?) are in the process of putting together a new law enforcement program. Murphy, now dead, gets enrolled and resurrected as Robocop. However, soon after, he recalls the men who killed him and goes on a rampage to find and apprehend them. There are many different layers of drama going on here, and I won't go into how it all ties together. With the remake out now in theaters, I don't know how it'll compare to the original. Just know that it's a roller-coaster ride of a film with a healthy dose of acid wit!" "Although it was surprisingly better than I expected, having never seen it before, I only watched this because I really liked the new version and wanted to compare the two. First I'll say, the Robo costume was pretty good for an 80's style sci-fi / action film, but the newer one is so much more sleek and mechanical looking. The story to this film is a lot better than I expected, but a lot of scenes were cheesily filmed and acted that I couldn't take most of it seriously. It was entertaining for the most part, although very violent, and still holds up today. This would have probably been one of my favorite films had I seen it in 1987, but seeing this after the impressive newer version, it doesn't quite compare to me. I know that a lot of people will disagree with me and this won't be a popular review, but it is a honest review and my own opinion. Cheers!" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" ". . . Tigers game, which makes Kurtwood Smith's Crimelord character the ONLY link between ROBOCOP's \"old Detroit\" and the REAL Detroit of 1987. Otherwise, the setting for this flick is far too clean, and the characters way too jovial. There's is and was nothing to laugh about in Detroit. There also are NO buildings even close to having a \"95th floor,\" the stated level of \"Omni Consumer Product's\" (OCP's) board room. OCP's grand plan is to ADD two million people to Detroit's population (which plummeted in reality from two million in 1950 to 700,000 and counting down today). This sort of population growth would be outrageous for ANY city in the northern U.S. (you'd have to go to Brazil or China to see such an overnight demographic shift). When Detroit politicians run amok, such as the city councilman in this ROBOCOP, they don't simply demand \"a car with cruise control\"--they filch $19 billion, like Kwame Kilpatrick and his cohorts. In a city where fire fighters hold telethons to restock their stations with toilet paper, there hasn't been any cash available for high tech ANYTHING for decades. But every time you purchase a Little Caesar's pizza, Clarence says the Tigers get better swings." "RoboCop (1987) takes place in the future crime ridden Detroit. After Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) gets massacred by violent robbers that are lead by the ruthless Clearance Boddicker, he gets rebuild by the OCP company as a crime fighting cyborg. This is an awesome 1980's action/sci-fi film. Even though, I have not seen the remake, I guarantee that this film will be way better. Peter Weller was wonderful as Murphy/RoboCop. He was able to be badass, but also maintain a good amount of heart that made us care for him. The part where he gets massacred by Clearance Boddicker's gang has got to be one of the most messed up scenes filmed. When he gets massacred and has everything taken away from him including his humanity, you really sympathize for him. Which is one of the films strongest parts. Kurtwood Smith was awesome as Clearance Boddicker. I really liked his character so much. He was despicable, ruthless, and sadistic, but he was so entertaining to watch. Other cast members do a capable job at their roles, however one that stands out is Ronny Cox as Dick Jones. The direction by Paul Verhoeven is very good and might say this is one of his best films. Also, it is one that put him on the map. The score by Basil Poledouris is very thrilling and gets you invested during the scenes where RoboCop kicks ass. The action scenes are very violent and bloody. This film was filmed during the time when action movies were R-rated, unlike today you have studios trying to make it more kid friendly and just make a quick buck. My only problem with the film is some special effects may seem outdated in today's standards, especially the parts where Dick Jones falls from the building and the ED-209 design looked very clunky, but that isn't to say that it hurts the film. RoboCop is an entertaining film that features many badass moments. Anyone who are fans of the science fiction/action genre then you will more then likely enjoy this film. It is still holds up very well even though some of the special effects are outdated in today's standards. 9/10 stars." "Robocop is one of the greatest SCI-FI/Action films ever made and an excellent,thrilling and unforgettable classic that combines amazing direction,a great cast,explosive Action,a terrific score and outstanding special make-up effects. All of those elements make Robocop one of my all-time favorite Action films and Paul Verhoevan at his best. Set in a futuristic Detroit,Michigan,Robocop tells the story of Alex Murphy(Peter Weller),a cop who has been transferred to a police station on a dangerous side of Detroit where crime is up. While on duty,Murphy is brutally murdered by a group of criminals and left for dead but is brought back to life by mega-corporation OCP(Omni Consumer Products)as Robocop,a half human half machine Cyborg that is assigned to protect and serve the public and uphold the law. But when Robocop starts having memories of his death as Alex Murphy,Robocop wants to hunt down the men who killed him and wants to get them at all costs and whether they're dead or alive they're coming with Robocop. Robocop is one of the most brilliant and dazzling SCI-FI/Action films of the 1980s and of all-time and is one of those movies that is an instant classic from the moment you watch it,an amazing movie that is up there with other excellent and brilliant SCI-FI/Action classics such as Blade Runner,The Terminator,Terminator 2:Judgment Day,Aliens,Predator,Predator 2,Escape From New York and The Road Warrior. Robocop is also a movie that keeps you glued to screen and is like a Comic Book or Graphic Novel coming to life because throughout the film there is an over the top and wild energy that never stops until the very end and everything in Robocop is pushed to the limit whether it's explosions,guns or the violence but despite all of those things Robocop has a style and demented weirdness that makes the movie less serious. There is a politically incorrect in your face no holds barred attitude that I love about Action movies from the 1970s,80s and 90s and is one of the main reasons the film holds up as a classic and has stood the test of time. What I also love about Robocop is that it's apart of the sub genre of SCI-FI that I have always love Dystopian Futuristic film where there is a society,major city or country that takes place in a dark future and Robocop's future in Detroit depicts a bleak future where law enforcement is falling apart,criminals are ruling the streets and big money corporations have taken over pretty much everything. While Robocop does take place in the future the movie never reveals what year Robocop takes place in giving the future in Detroit a more timeless feel. What is also great about Robocop is that while it's still an explosive Action film,there is also a great deal of Humor and Satire that is in the film and it is very funny whether it's with Robocop dealing with the criminals on the streets,the movie mocking American consumer culture,Television commercials or News Media which makes Robocop not only relevant in 1987 but for many years to come. The Humor and Satire can be seen as a precursor to director Paul Verhoeven two other amazing SCI-FI/Action films Total Recall and Starship Troopers. All three films would make a great triple feature. Robocop also has themes in the film dealing with greed,big business corporations and urban decay commenting on the President Reagan era of the 1980s in an honest and sometimes funny way. The Action and violent scenes in Robocop are amazing,bloody and sometimes brutal,(so brutal in fact that Robocop got an X-Rating from the MPAA)but the Action is done in such a way that it matches perfectly with the film's outlandish Comic Book tone. The Action is fast and so relentless you will never have time to catch your breath. The main character Robocop is one of the all-time great movie characters in SCI-FI and Action films because even though he is a machine Robocop is still a human inside the metal flesh and while Robocop is successful as Robocop he begins to discover the human side that he used to be in Alex Murphy and throughout the movie we see Robocop trying to find out who he really was in his past while being a cop. This element gives the movie and main character sadness and levels of depth that separates Robocop from the some of the other Action movies of the 1980s and is one the reasons Robocop is a classic character you will never forget. The ending of Robocop is great,exciting and explosive and is fantastic conclusion that will have you cheering at the screen. An tremendous ending. The cast is great. Peter Weller is excellent as Robocop/Alex Murphy,with Weller bringing power and depth to the role. Nancy Allen is terrific as Officer Anne Lewis,Robocop/Murphy's partner. Daniel O'Herlihy is great as The Old Man,a top executive at OCP. Ronny Cox is wonderful as Dick Jones,a top man at OCP. Kurkwood Smith is fantastic as Clarence Boddicker,a vicious criminal and killer. Miguel Ferrer is terrific as Bob Norton,a rival executive of Dick Jones that helps create Robocop. Robert DoQui(Sergeant Warren Reed),Felton Perry(Johnson),Ray Wise(Leon),Paul McCrane(Emil),Jesse Goins(Joe),Calvin Jung(Steve Minh)and Lee DeBroux(Sal)give good performances as well. The direction by Paul Verhoeven is brilliant and memorable,with Verhoeven always moving the camera and keeping the film moving at a tight pace while also doing a great job with the Action scenes. Incredible direction,Verhoeven. The score by Basil Poledouns is fantastic,powerful,epic and one of the best scores I have ever heard in an Action movie and matches the film perfectly. Amazing score,Poledouns. The special make-up effects by Rob Bottin are outstanding,realistic and is among the best work Bottin has ever done. Dazzling work,Bottin. In final word,if you love Science Fiction,Action Films or Paul Verhoeven,I highly suggest you see Robocop,an excellent,thrilling and unforgettable classic that you can watch again and again. Highly recommended. 10/10." "Robocop has become a cult classic for many movie buffs. And I have to agree. It has a great mix of humour, great dialogue and satire. Many find the violence --over the top--but if taken in context with the whole movie...its really a necessary element. I believe that this film was never---at any point---meant to be taken seriously. The first scenes, where we see two ridiculously funny T.V. presenters sets the tone for what is to come. I don't agree with those who call this science fiction. The word is FUTURISTIC. This is never boring and moves along at a nice pace. The characters are well acted and memorable. Well worth watching ...and like all cult movies...can be enjoyed on multiple viewings." "Things will get worse before they get better (if they ever get better, especially in Detroit). In one possible future, it could become a mad world of ecological, economical, political, and commercial excesses. It could be a terrifying breeding ground for more extreme and violent crime, which would call for a more extreme and powerful type of police officer. Enter RoboCop: a hybrid of man and machine to make a perfect cop. This film starts off hard and fast, and remains perfectly entertaining throughout its short run-time. It's jam-packed with pulpy hardcore action, with loads of shootouts, chases, and some really gnarly kills. The film strikes a perfect pace, never lingering too long on any of the action or drama, but still offering just enough to satisfy. The film gets really extreme with its exaggerated (perhaps cheesy) level of acting, its level of bloodshed, and its satire, but it's awesome that way. Most of the film's appeal, however, is that it's so fundamental and simple. It goes through a basic death-and-rebirth storyline, which provides the origin of the character and drives the rest of the story through retribution and corporate conspiracy. There is just enough attention to the characters to make them relevant and endearing. On top of that, however, the film also packs in a lot of thought-provoking ideas. Some of the funniest and most memorable scenes include faux news reports and commercials with a strong satirical edge, which provides more background on the crazy world RoboCop inhabits. The film breezes through numerous themes regarding capitalism, the mass media, gentrification, and overall dystopia. The film also raises a bunch of pertinent questions regarding technology and its application, especially with a strong man-vs-machine theme at work. Alex Murphy proves definitively that law enforcement can't be fully automated; an officer needs human compassion and free-will. No matter how hard the enemies try to destroy all that makes Murphy human, he triumphs every time, over the machine of society and the machine within him. This film features some crazy and intense photography, the likes of which only Paul Verhoeven can direct. The shots are often tight, with some scenes that use wild and unusual angles. There are a number of point-of-view shots, which are ingenious. Camera movements are solid and smooth. Editing is decent. Acting is over-the-top and exaggerated, for fantastic effect; Peter Weller and Nancy Allen are pretty earnest and great to watch, while Kurtwood Smith, Ronny Cox, and Miguel Ferrer all excel at being bad guys we love to hate. Writing is concise and sharp, and there are quite a few good, memorable lines. This production uses some cheap and outdated props and sets, but the architecture and technology is often used to create a unique post-modern look and style. Costumes are great, and the special effects hold up well. Music is pretty catchy too. RoboCop is one of those films that feels longer than it is, because within the confines of its simple and fundamental story, it crafts a dense storytelling experience that's full of energy as it is full of ideas. Best of all, it's a film with some serious guts: a piece of pulp sci-fi the likes of which you probably won't find too often in Hollywood anymore. Over the film's home video history, there has been both the original R-rated cut and the unrated director's cut available. Really, it only amounts to 30 seconds of additional footage (mostly violence). Recommended for mature audiences. 5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)" "Add another review" "Find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your Watchlist and rate your favorite movies and TV shows on your phone or tablet!")("Movies, TV & Showtimes" "Celebs, Events & Photos" "News & Community" "Watchlist" "" "Find industry contacts & talent representation" "Manage your photos, credits, & more" "Showcase yourself on IMDb & Amazon" "Sign in with Facebook Other Sign in options" "Own the rights?" "As a fan of science fiction movies and also action movies and police movies I obviously loved Robocop. What I loved most of all about it was that it did not hold back any punches as far as all of the violence was concerned. There are some pretty intense scenes especially in the unrated version so you probably would not want kids to be watching this movie even though the language for the most part is not too bad at least from how I remember it. But also there is a lot of really funny comical moments in the movie that we really enjoyed. I just watched it again because I want to see the reboot version of Robocop I just really hope that they don't ruin it!" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Detroit is ridden with corruption and crime, ran by a company. Officer Murphy and Officer Lewis go about their daily routines when it all goes horribly wrong during an arrest attempt of the nefarious Clarence Boddicker. Officer Lewis is compromised and unable to try to help Murphy, leading to Murphy's violent death. Murphy is reassembled into a cyborg. The experiment is a huge success, until Murphy starts having visions of his past life. Murphy goes on a mission with Officer Lewis to rid Detroit of all evil and more importantly, get revenge Paul Verhoeven made two terrific Sci-Fi films: Total Recall & Robocop. They simply don't make them like this anymore. Spare me the so-called \"remake\" I'm willing to give it a chance, but I have a bad feeling it will suck. We don't need a remake! This one is pretty daring for the time it was made. When I was younger, I was absolutely appalled with Murphy's death. It really upset me to the point where I almost cried. It doesn't do that these days, although it is still a bit disturbing to watch. I wouldn't say the script is exactly top-notch. It actually comes across as somewhat cheesy at times, but Verhoeven has such a grasp on the entertainment that it ends up being an unforgettable action ride. The effects are definitely dated. There is a robot in this movie (Ed- 209) that comes across as incredibly corny with how weak it looks. If you're a fan of violence, dig in! It is time for the signature Verhoeven violence. We get a cornucopia of bloody gunshot wounds, impailings, someone explodes in half when hit by a car, and someone's arm is shot off. We also get a spike in the neck. The acting is solid. Peter Weller is appropriately shy and subtle as Murphy while firing off some great lines as Robocop. The man took what could have been a one-dimensional part and made it into his own. I just wish more background on his family was revealed. Those scenes were riveting. I felt Murphy's pain. Nancy Allen is slightly awkward in her role. She seemed a bit unsure on what to do but she's still oddly charming. Her chemistry with Weller was great as well. Ronny Cox is absolutely terrific as a villain and Kurtwood Smith is his match as the other villain. Kurtwood is clearly having a blast in his role. He turns it up a few notches in this one. Miguel Ferrer is wonderfully slimy in his role and chewed up the scenery. This man can do no wrong in my eyes. Even Ray Wise has a role in this one. Final Thoughts: Robocop was so influential at one point, a wrestling company known as WCW (World Championship Wrestling) had Robocop appear on a PPV. It didn't work out very well, but that doesn't matter. As far as entertainment is concerned, it doesn't get much better than this for action movies. This comes highly recommended, creep! 9/10" "In a desensitized near-future overrun with corruption, police officer Weller is brutally murdered by a gang of criminals and is revived as a superhuman cyborg. Spot on when initially released. Weller's miming is well executed and much of the SFX still holds up. The stop-motion of the droid in the boardroom scene dates very poorly, but the tragic event within the scene is as chilling as ever. Even though the film achieves at having an assortment of very heartless bad guys, their deeds still seem a bit inexplicable and over-the-top even for the bleak world the story is set in. Some of the character-arcs are a bit bumpy and the ending seems slightly rushed. Criticism aside, ROBOCOP is one of the few sci-fi action films of the '80s that has withstood the test of time. *** (out of four)" "Brilliant sci-fi movie, well-thought and fantastic from various perspectives. The movie makes a point at different levels. At the physical level by being a plain revenge-drama. At the social level of making a case of where to draw the line of privatisation and automation. At the metaphysical level of longetivity of the subconscious, even beyond physical death. The sarcasms on our daily double-standards are hilarious and in a way, ahead of it's time! In a sense, the director took a risk by creating a soul, but succeeded by elevating, what would otherwise have been a plain-jane action movie." "I first saw Robocop when I was 5 years old...yes I was only 5. I've got my grandparents to thank for that little mistake. I remember being absolutely petrified by it. Walking armoured machines with really sinister voices saying I had 20 seconds to comply, Murphy's disgustingly disturbing death, Robocop's struggle to hold onto his humanity....and THAT scene (which I'll get to in a moment).  22 years later, the remake has been announced with a few impressive names attached to the film and with the first Omnicorp viral doing the rounds I thought it may be time to revisit Detroit's finest. So for the second time in my life, and considering my ever-growing experience watching fantastic pieces of work, was it any good? Hmmm sort of. What I would say immediately is that (believe it or not) Robocop is not really about a cyborg policeman. The film tries to relay a message so much bigger than the future of law enforcement. Paul Verhoeven and Ed Neumeier have gone on record to say as much. To be honest without their conformation the film does blatantly show this. Robocop is an attempt to expose America for what they think it is, money hungry. The film is bathed in images and dialogue which portrays a disgusting country that has lost its sense of pride.  In my opinion, the best parts of the film involved key executives of Omnicorp, the villainous organisation that has its grip firmly on Detroit. The suits are portrayed as the school frat boys of business desperately wanting get ahead of the other in popularity and riches. The famous ED-209 scene in the board room is particularly important to show this. To this day it was still pretty scary to watch and incredibly violent, but what was interesting to see was how dumbed down the reactions were from the members of the board. I don't think this was a case of bad acting or direction, I think this was an intentional  move to show that to us it's a tragic death, to Omnicorp it's a set-back. I was also surprised by its attention to media brainwashing. Showing us news coverage and full screen commercials as if the movie has stopped for a break, suggesting WE need a break to here from their sponsors, like WE need a product fix. The catchphrase \"I'd buy that for a dollar\" is used so much over the course of the film that it becomes  embedded and never goes away. The affect works very well. I've talked quite a lot there about Robocop's intention as a social satire but what about the literal plot that most people remember the film for. Unfortunately in its literal sense, Robocop as a few flaws. Don't get me wrong, Murphy's transition from human to robot is great. The shots are well planned and gripping and Robocop himself looks amazing but it falls pretty flat by the lack of emotion shown by other characters. Murphy's so-called partner Lewis is so wooden that it's hard to believe that in such a short space of time that she has become emotionally involved in Robocop's problems. She is pretty forgettable to be honest. Another real problem with this film is that its action sequences to me are pretty dull.  I honestly don't think they pack any sort of punch to keep anyone interested and unfortunately the soundtrack is awful. Listening to the main theme that has become so iconic over the years made me feel a little embarrassed to the point where it can't really be taken seriously as an 18 certificate action flick. But having said that, Robocop has one of the most disturbing sequences in the history if film involving a vat of acid.  It was a sequence that really disturbed me as a 5 year old boy and the affect has not worn away. It's so relevant to early David Cronenberg body horror images that it feels extremely out of place for a film of this nature. However, this scene alone cannot save Robocop from its bland action moments. So, did I like it? From the many 80's action films that came our way it's definitely the worst I've seen. It tried to take a lot from Terminator and certainly didn't have the grit and horror that James Cameron achieved. On the plus side, Robocop has some really interesting ideas to try and explain where we are as a society and where we are heading. These parts are brilliantly done, I just wish the final product had more meat on the bone so we could watch it for what it is, not for what it was trying to say." "Robocop is by far one of the best sci-fi action movies released in the 1980's. The look of this movie is just astonishing. It has very good visual effects, special effects and there is a lot of violence. This movie is about a police officer who was shot to death by a gang of ruthless criminals and is brought back to life as a half man/half machine named robocop. Hence the films title. Peter Weller was amazing for his role as the lead character. Nancy Allen was outstanding as his partner. In this movie, she is the moral compass. And hands off to Ronny Cox and Kurtwood Smith as the bad guys. This movie is a true classic. It is a must see." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This film is absolutely thrilling on many levels! I always like movies that have cyborgs involved because they do not care about human feelings, they have a program, and their goal is to abide by the program and the rules. This movie has a different twist on that, especially when Robocop starts to remember what happened to him when he was human. This film also has some great villains, and great action involved! The movie has some very violent scenes, so I strongly suggest to get the kids out of the room before watching it because they will more than likely have nightmares especially when one of the villains crashes into a vat of toxic waste! Overall, this movie triumphs as a terrific action film. I think it's message is no matter how much you try to make a man into a machine, you can never terminate someone's mind and emotions! So, give this movie a shot! Long live Robocop!" "This film optimises all the good bits of the 80s. It is ludicrously both violent and funny in places, contains some of the best one liners ever, is set in the future and has a great soundtrack. What more could you ask for! Paul Verhoven was obviously influenced by classics like West World and the film has a really strong good versus evil thread running through it with quite strong religious undertones as well. This is definitely my favourite film of all time and I would highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it. Please bear in mind that there was hardly any CGI used so some of the effects do look a little dated, but that's part of it's charm." "In short, pretty darn well with but a few minor annoyances. For those who never saw it, the name Robocop sounds pretty cheesy but it's nevertheless accurate. It's a mortally wounded normal cop transformed into some kind of cyborg and marketed as the future of law enforcement by a corporation who actually owns the Detroit police. Of course, the corporation wipes out his memories, but the interesting thing is that some start to come back. I found Robocop pretty entertaining and the near future presented here, although not spectacular, shows an interesting satire of society through newscasts and ads. In my memory, there were more ads but the few there are are cynical, darkly humorous and slightly disturbing. Robocop himself is (obviously) rather unemotional but he's cool nevertheless in a deadpan no no-nonsense kinda way. How he deals with each criminal situation is always fun and sometimes surprising. He's slow, methodical, bulletproof and he aims very well. The actions scenes are not frenetic or fast, they're ponderous yet still have impact. The Robocop look is a classic and I don't think it will go out of style. The sound effects and his body movements (especially the head) help sell the mechanical nature of Robocop. I remember this movie having gory disgusting moments and it still has a few, but mostly they're over fast. Anything involving shooting looks painful and it's not glamorized although you'll inwardly cheer whenever Robocop shoots someone because it feels as if they deserve it. That judge-jury-executioner mentality always bugged me in action movies but it bugged me less here. The villains are pretty caricatural but at least they have some personality. The movie tries to make us dislike them, even by showing small despicable acts, and it works. I weirdly wish we had more of those bad guys today instead of the bland cookie-cutter unemotional ones. It's not a movie you watch for the acting as some of it is somewhat over-the-top (looking at you police chief). Yet in the context of this serious satire and since Robocop himself is serious, it blends nicely. Speaking of seriousness, Robocop's actions provide some of the best humour because he's so earnest and clever in his interventions. Despite that, when you think about it, he's a very tragic figure and he has a good character arc. One of the most memorable scenes for me was after his \"accident\" after he's gradually activated, with the cam being Robocop's vision (and us the viewer), intersped with darkness intervals. Two very good echoing memorable scenes are him being shot as a human by criminals (very brutal) and him as a cyborg being shot by law enforcement (nasty and unfair). It makes you fear for him. So, it's been mostly praise up to now but there are a few other things that annoyed me. I liked how the flashbacks were shown but emotionally wise, they didn't grab me as they should have, especially the ones with the kid. I liked how the robot alternative (ED-209) to Robocop looked and it was sometimes quite menacing but it moved too much like stop-motion model animation to me or as part of a miniature set. It looked great at the time but that part didn't age so well. There was also something near the end, that I cannot describe for fear of spoilers, involving a rod that didn't make sense, cheapening the drama. I could guess an explanation but none was offered here either before or after. I think Robocop aged very well. He still looks decent, the humour still amuses, you root for the hero, you hate the bad guys and the story holds up with its twists. Action-wise, I think Robocop's \"slowness\" is an asset rather than a detriment. It makes the action clear and you can anticipate what's coming, making things more satisfying (but still surprising sometimes). Rating: 8 out of 10 (very good)" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Five narrative conflicts in one movie; Man vs. Self, Man vs. Man, Man Vs. Society, Man Vs. Technology, Man Vs. Fate. All in one movie. I am biased to be sure, but RoboCop, is a dramatic movie about grief and loss wrapped up in a shoddy plastic case with flaking gray paint. I watched this the other night again, and even with the ultra violence, the thing that I noticed was how the man became a man, then became a fusion of the two emotionally after he became the machine. Certain things are off in the movie; Murphy's kid is cast too old to properly sympathize with (an 8-10 year old would have been better)and the demographics of Detroit are all wrong, but this is negated by the overall effect. Like the scene where we do not see the steel mill tracheotomy, but the execution of it implies exactly the shock of it, a tight story with great casting, the right rhythm, and the right direction for it's time and place. An extraordinary film; and here are the conflicts; Man vs. Self; Murphy must come to terms with his new self, his reawakened emotions and his inability to go back to the life he once knew. A movie where a man mourns and avenges his own death? Genius. Man vs. Man; Murphy/Robocop vs. Bodiker and Dick Jones, a truly believable duo of villains. Man vs. Society; Robocop loved and hated, an abomination, a Frankenstein, respected and feared but not loved, not human. Can also be Robocop vs. the filth of the city and the corruption of OCP. Man vs. Technology; Now a mechanical man, Robocop fights not only against his new self, but the ED 209s (a wonderful nemesis in it's own right). 'You might not like what you're going to see.' Man vs. Fate; His mission complete, with Clarence Bodiker and Dick Jones taken care of, Robocop becomes resigned to his new role, his new duty, his new self. Love this movie."

"In a dystopian near-future, Police Officer Alex J. Murphy (Peter Weller) is transferred to a rough precinct in downtown Detroit, where he is teamed with tough female cop Anne Lewis (the lovely Nancy Allen). On their first job together, Murphy is gunned down by a vicious gang of criminals, but is rebuilt by corrupt corporate giant OCP who put him back on the streets as RoboCoppart man, part machine, all cop! As a huge fan of Judge Dredd, 2000AD comic's tough lawman of the future, RoboCop was like a dream come true for me when he first came stomping onto the silver screen in 1987. The emotionless lawman wearing a menacing helmet leaving only the lower part of the face visible; the massive handgun; the power of judge, jury and executioner; the use of snappy one-liners ('Your move, Creep': a Dredd-ism if ever there was one): this was Dredd in all but name (only with the benefit of heavy-duty armour plating and a computer for a brain!). Whether script-writer Ed Neumeier and director Paul Verhoeven deliberately channelled the spirit of Judge Dredd into their movie I cannot say for sure, but they certainly captured the essence of the long running comic stripfull of brilliantly realised ultra-violence, satirical swipes at the privatisation of public services, corporate greed and the media, and cool special effects, this is the Dredd film that Sylvester Stallone's debacle never was. Given the choice between the official movie version of the character and RoboCop, I would go with the latter every time. Verhoeven's handling of Neumeier's wonderful script is spot onbrutal, yet touching and wittyand his excellent cast couldn't be better: thanks to training from a mime artist, Peter Weller is utterly convincing as a man turned machine, but also brings a much-needed sense of pathos to his character; the always reliable Allen gives solid support as his spunky partner; Ronny Cox and Kurtwood Smith impress as the film's utterly despicable main bad guys; even the lesser roles are perfect, from ER's Paul McCrane as henchman Emil right down to the guy who would 'buy that for a dollar'! Add snappy editing, a rousing score by Basil Poledouris which helps drive the action forward, plenty of quotable dialogue, and lots of graphic splatter (Verhoeven doesn't hold back on the gore), and what you have is one of the greatest sci-fi/action films of all time. Quite simply, everything about RoboCop works beautifully, like a well oiled piece of precision machinery." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Too bad RoboCop isn't more appreciated. It's really one of the best science-fiction films ever. It could have been just another silly Hollywood product, but in Dutch director Paul Verhoeven's hands it became a thought-provoking and well-crafted critique of American business and culture. OCP (Omni Consumer Products) represents the power of American capitalism. It's a company so wealthy and so powerful that it can reconstruct the entire downtown of the city of Detroit and create a million new jobs. Its two recent products, ED-209 and RoboCop, were made to enforce its plans. ED-209 is a hulk of a robot that can go out of control and kill without consideration. It represents the dark side of American capitalism. RoboCop is a modern knight in shining armour. He's a cyborg who can think, feel and go after the real criminals. He was built by OCP but, because he was the righteous police officer Alex Murphy before, he goes against his creators. In a way, the film is a modern Robin Hood story. Murphy represents Robin Hood while Richard \"Dick\" Jones is Prince John and Clarence Boddicker is the High Sheriff of Nottingham. Jones is the ideal 1980s American businessman. He's aggressive, corrupt, and very much profit-oriented. Robert \"Bob\" Morton on the other hand is younger, a bit wild, and with new ideas. RoboCop is Morton's creation. The cyborg looks fantastic. Peter Weller plays him very well. Just the way he moves is striking. Nancy Allen plays Murphy's pretty partner, officer Anne Lewis. The two remain close even after Murphy becomes RoboCop. The supporting cast is obviously good too, especially the criminals. The four of them are quite the characters. Still, Boddicker easily stands out (Kurtwood Smith wore glasses so that he'd look more like Heinrich Himmler). All the action in the film, though sometimes bloody, is amazing. The music score is another big attraction, fitting the film like a glove. There's plenty of clever humour and corporate criticism. The film's Detroit looks like a futuristic city but also like a decaying one, with crime and poor neighbourhoods. Some reviewers said that the film promotes fascism. The filmmakers denied this, however. In reality RoboCop has socialist messages. There's a lot to like about the film. It's entertaining and it rewards repeat viewings. Director Ken Russell called it the best science-fiction film since Metropolis (1927). RoboCop gets a high recommendation from me." "A cop is brutally murdered in the line of duty only to be resurrected as a robot cop. With a mission to clean up Detroit stopping criminals and corruption unwitting Robocop meets his killers. Social commentary, religious connotations and cutting satire, Paul Verhoeven's Robocop is now over 20 years old, some of the effects have dated and some of the acting is like two-day-old chicken, but it holds up. It is indeed an often-imitated sci-fi classic. It could have been just another Terminator rip-off but all it shared was a machine theme as it had a whole world of its own. That said, it borrows heavily from lesser known films Jean-Claude Lord's The Vindicator and The Wraith both made a year prior. Amongst the rival robot ED-209 and TV commercials what's more interesting about Robocop (played by the now elusive Peter Weller) is the loss of his family and how they have moved on after Alex Murphy's gory death which is only partly explored. There's a lot going on in Edward Neumeier & Michael Miner writing underneath all the action pieces. Miguel Ferrer as 'Bob' is excellent, his performance has all the 80's Wall Street feel of the time, doing whatever it takes to get to the top. Ronny Cox plays 'Dick' Jones and gives the bad guy dimension. It shows a corporate structure and how they also use the underworld to get an immoral job done, in this case using Clarence and his gang played terrifically by Kurtwood Smith. Basil Poledouris' music is fantastic and heightens the films punches and subtleties, the action is great as to are the costumes and practical effects. It is a comic book film for adults but is unusually grounded in a surreal plausibility. It's Orion Pictures fine production, part man, part machine. All cop." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "With its direct-to-video-ready title and decidedly B-movie caliber plot, Robocop really shouldn't be as fantastic as it is. But, by elevating the explosive action sequences with a rather interesting study of science's inability to remove the soul from a human being and some deft satire, this film has actually aged far better than most of its contemporaries. I'm sure most people aren't looking for all that hocus pocus in a film that is more readily billed as a straight, adrenaline-charged action vehicle, so it of course helps that Robocop lives up to the qualifications of this classification with admirable and awesome ease. There are several action set-pieces in this film, most notably the drug lab shootout and the brilliantly realized finale, that live on as scenes that can be watched again and again without losing any of their gravitas. As silly as the idea of Peter Weller stomping out baddies in an intricate metal suit may sound on paper, the seriousness with which the film handles the character of Robocop ensures that we get engrossed enough in his quest for justice that we forget about the logistics of the clunky costume and simply accept it as a feasible creation in the world Paul Verhoeven crafts around it. As an added bonus, the splatter elements are so far beyond anything that had been seen in a mainstream action picture at the time (trust me, I was there), that the violence functions as both over-the-top thrills and as a potent set-up for Robocop's eventual revenge mission. You can't help but feel for poor Murphy when he meets his fate in an early sequence that set a new standard for brutality. On this front, fans of the crimson sauce will be well-advised to seek out the Criterion Collection DVD, which reinstates some cut gore that adds even more weight (as if it were needed) to Murphy's brutal execution, and lets us get a longer glimpse of the firepower of ED-209 as he shreds a hapless executive to ribbons. Weller is very strong in the title role, despite the mechanical nature of his character, and the human element is never too far removed from the robotic creation he has become. The cast is augmented by a slew of brilliant character actors, all of whom you will immediately recognize from several prominent films and television shows. An especially strong turn by Nancy Allen, who is a lot of fun to watch as she holds her own with the high-caliber actors and firepower around her, makes me wonder why I can't readily remember seeing her in ANY other movies (it's also telling that she doesn't even have a picture on her IMDb listing). Allen doesn't strike the viewer as a leading lady, but her nimble handling of material that could be ridiculous in the wrong hands makes it quite amazing that she didn't go on to equally prominent roles. The humor elements are well-restrained and brought in to serve the film, not dominate it. Our titular law enforcement titan doesn't crack a one-liner every time he shoots a bad guy, which was refreshing in 1987, and still is today. Even if we get to laugh a bit throughout, none of the jokes derail the forward momentum of the action, and certainly the grim violence offsets any hint of this film being a camp movie. Though not quite a masterpiece, Robocop has all the elements of a great action movie, and plenty more elements that most genre films of the era didn't have the intelligence to ponder. It's hard to imagine anyone who knows what this film is being disappointed. Highly recommended." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This excellent action, thriller fits into a category or genre that I have dubbed Comic Book Films. In these films the action is tense and furious, the death count unusually high and a little imagination is required of the viewer. RoboCop is even more as it has a high level of satire to spice things up. Paul Verhoeven is one the originators of this genre and one its finest directors. He keeps the pace really moving, adds touches of humor in just the right spots, and he gets the best out of his casts and crews. RoboCop is the perfect example. Peter Weller is perfection as Alex Murphy / RoboCop, giving heart and character to a robot/cyborg and proving he's up to the action as well. Nancy Allen is excellent as his compassionate partner, Officer Anne Lewis. The film has a trio of great villains led by Kurtwood Smith at his nastiest, vilest best, Miguel Ferrer as the sleazy creator of RoboCop, and Ronny Cox as a creepy, despicable CEO of OCP. Dan O'Herlihy adds class as \"The Old Man\". The score, by the great Basil Poledouris, is fabulous and complements the movie. I highly recommend \"RoboCop\" to anyone who enjoys a terrific action film!" "Satire, Comedy, 'over-the-top' violence and emotion is executed with perfection in this movie. 'RoboCop' is the story of police officer; Alex Murphy, who is brutally massacred by a vicious group of criminals. Murphy is then chosen to be the subject of the \"RoboCop project\" prototype, which is an operation that assembles dead policemen into cyborgs. A part-man, part-machine incarnation of Murphy, now called; RoboCop, rides through the old streets of Detroit, fighting crime as a robot police man. RoboCop slowly finds out what happened to Alex Murphy and learns that he was Murphy before his reincarnation as a Cyborg. RoboCop then sets out to get revenge for himself by going after the killers. I first watched this film when I was 7, and I became a 'Robo-fan' instantly after seeing it. To me it was a bad-ass film about a Robot-police man kicking ass in the most vicious way however, when I watch it now, it is more than that. It is a powerful picture about humanity and all its values. The action scenes are incredible and the reflection of 1980's America is done disturbingly well by director; Paul Verhoeven (A legend of his time). I give it 10 stars. Thank You for reading." "Sharp, biting, relentless and over-the-top. I dig it! Paul Verhoeven's high-tech Sci-fi masterpiece 'Robocop' truly stands the test of time, and I don't see it falling from its pedestal anytime soon. Exceptional film-making, and the pride shows in the finished product. Verhoeven' slick and sleek tailoring blends superbly with Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner's furiously lethal, but smartly witty material. You got to have memorable villains, and 'Robocop is no exception. Ronny Cox (corrupt corporate power) and Kurtwood Smith (maniac criminal) are brilliant in their roles, and they're matched up by Peter Weller's perfectly humane performance as Robocop. He emotionally engages. Miguel Ferrer's turn has a lively sting as the man behind the creation and Ray Wise is good. However Nancy Allen is rather ho-hum, acceptable but nothing that stands out really she's bland. The characters are very well-drawn up. Now the special effects. Outstanding and inspired! This is what I miss, and the execution is barnstorming. The stop-motion ED209 design looks great and the metallic creation RoboCop himself is magnetically achieved with the clash between the two being heart-racing experience. As for the action, it comes in spades. Verhoeven drills in the scorching suspense and punishing violence with ease, and this heavy-handed style works due to its gusty premise. Basil Poledouris' score pounds away, but manages a majestic vibe that simply soars. Satire, violence and profanity done in an unapologetic manner by being swirled in to a wicked sense of dark humour and unstoppable energy. Imaginative, powerful and evocative entertainment." "Officer Murphy arises from the dead as a robotic cop who is about to kick some criminal butt... It sounds pretty corny, and it is pretty corny, but it's a pretty great ride while it lasts. As soon as you see the special effects, you know you're in an 80s movie, but that's what makes this so lovable. The action is a little cheesy at times and some of the lines are pretty lame, but if you decide to watch this movie because you want to see the Ironman of 20 years ago, you've made a mistake. This movie knows what it is and doesn't try to be anything more. It has some pretty entertaining fight scenes and the whole concept of a robotic cop is pretty much all this needs. Sure, if this movie was made in 2008 it would be a bit pathetic, but as 80s action goes, this is pretty great." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "I must have been about eleven when i first saw Robocop, the version i had seen on TV was so extremely censored that i was asking myself: why did he die? The damage done to him, didn't looked that serious. As a child, i liked the movie mainly for the effects and robots, but the more i grew up, the more my perception of this movie widened itself and yet there was a shock to come. About ten years later i bought the criterion DVD of Robocop and still i knew nothing, also i had seen Starship Troopers and knew as well as had seen about Verhovens, let's say addiction to movie violence and extreme gore, but still... \"Nana nanana, nana nanana!\" Boom! And off Murphys hand flew, i felt like someone had kicked me in the stomach with full throttle, i truly felt like witnessing an accident or violent crime. I will not give away the full horror of Murphys death, but i have to say, i am not a wuss when it comes to movie violence, but this scene repeated itself in my head as well as willing and unwilling for the next two weeks! The unedited scene with Kinney in the boardroom was already quite unsettling, but you still could laugh, well it was a sick but yet still desperate laugh, there was still something funny about it, but when it came to the full Monty in this scene, oh boy! I couldn't believe that they where laughing at him and making jokes, so sick and depraved, it is hard to believe, but sometimes humans can be so cruel to each other, you just have to watch the news to find out, that this is sadly but quite common, in one form or the other. But if you really keep your focus on the story, you can experience something wonderful, despite all the vile and cruel images. This movie is so much: Satire, Comedy, Science-Fiction, even Horror! But most important it is a great drama! Most people i know, have never seen the original Robocop, they only saw the sequels or the TV shows, or they just oversaw the movie, as what it is. I more or less forced some of my friends to watch Robocop in it's unedited form and all of them where more or less shocked about Murphys death scene, but all told me in the end how wrong they where prejudging or misunderstanding the movie and they all said, that this is a great classic and unsettling drama. It is disguised though, but if you strip Robocop of all the robots and cyborgs, all the guns and drugs, all the corporative slime-bags and thugs, what you then have is a drama and a great one too! It is about the loss of identity, about the value of life, it shows how fragile we are and that we can die any second and that all we take for granted can vanish in an instant! As Verhoven mentioned himself Robocop is about the paradise lost, something you remember, but never can return to. I restrain my self now, because there is so much more to say about this movie, some things probably said, but if you want to see a great action film, a right in your face satire, if you like robots and cool old school stop-motion, if you like extreme bloody violence and if you have a strong stomach, then i only can recommend Robocop! I could write more about this movie, as many others did and could, but you really should see it for your self! Ignore the flaws of this classic and focus on what is important: The drama of Alex J. Murphy!!! And you will see and this is guaranteed a fantastic movie!!!" "Because there is not only a lot of humor in RoboCop, but a lot of hilarious, off-the-wall, goofy black humor extracted from the idea of a ruthless, callous dystopian future in a movie that gives the impression of a grim action thriller, it plunks us out of auto-pilot. We're not entirely certain where the film is going, and that's one of any movie's greatest features. It is Detroit in the future, where violent crime is unmanageable, perhaps because the city is in an economic shambles. The city hires the ubercorporation OCP to sponsor and control the police department, but OCP is not concerned with replenishing the city but instead changing it to an up-to-the-minute utopia. So, they intend to end crime in the city with an already inundated police department. Ronny Cox, the second highest echelon in the conglomerate, introduces a new cop robot called ED-209, which should end the crime in the city. An unrehearsed presentation goes wrong when ED-209 doesn't see that a volunteer has dropped his gun as commanded and unloads on him. A cocky lower employee played by Miguel Ferrer propositions the RoboCop program. Peter Weller plays Murphy, a cop newly transfered to another precinct, soon fatally wounded, to say the very very very least, in action by a vicious gang of villains led by a notorious mastermind played fantastically by Kurtwood Smith, and pronounced dead in the hospital. His brain and face, however, (I can hear you laughing) are used for a robot and he becomes RoboCop, patrolling the city with an extremely effective brand of crimefighting. The rough skeleton of the scenario grows by the side of relatively customary action- adventure outline. But this is not a customary action adventure. Paul Verhoeven, the exceptional Dutch filmmaker is never clearly pigeonholed. There is broad comedy in this movie, and a sure quantity of philosophy, resting on the ponderance of what necessitates a human being. One of those pop culture philosophy books should be written about the RoboCop character and universe, definitely. And there is sharp satire, too. Taking into account that he spends most of his on-screen time behind makeup devices or RoboCop's alloy cowl and visor, Peter Weller is clever in his manner of emoting through stoicism. Nancy Allen is great, and not just a token sexy lady role, Ronny Cox is a great villain, so hateful, and the film's music score is actually quite infectiously memorable. This is one of my guilty favorites."

"RoboCop is a rather classic yet kind of underrated Sci-Fi/Action gem of the 1980's. The film offered plenty of violence, satire and action and the film definitely delivered all three elements. The story is simple, a police officer gets killed in the line of duty by a crime gang but is resurrected as a Half-Man, Half-Machine officer nicknamed RoboCop. Of course, there's more to that story than it sounds. Sure, it sounds cheesy but believe me, it's more than that. Aside from the satire, the film also shows his distraught and sadness over the loss of his humanity and the loss of his family. The acting is great. Nobody could play Alex Murphy/RoboCop better than Peter Weller, he was born to play the character. Nanyc Allen played her role well, Ronny Cox and Kurtwood Smith played really great assholes and their characters also became one of my all time favorite villains. There's a lot of gore in the unrated cut to please fellow gore fiends like myself. The script is really good and Paul Verhoeven handled his direction of the film like a champ, it is that good. Barely any nitpicks. Overall, 10 out of 10 from me." "We are all screwed... well, if you live in Detroit you are. I saw Robocop in the theaters as a 10 year old kid and watched adults leave in disgust and shock while a married couple argued because she wanted to leave and he didn't by the film's halfway point. Awesome! As an adult, I've come to see the lines that separate genres of film internally. Sci-Fi is vast, many of the stories being in the future (Star Trek/Bladerunner) or futuristic (Star Wars/Last Starfighter)... then there is the 'UltraViolent' segment (see Clockwork Orange/Mad Max). RoboCop blurred the lines between most if just slightly. Easily one of Verhoven's best works this film was a huge surprise hit. Not starring anyone in particular but great turns by Weller and Kurtwood Smith it hit home like a grenade you stare at but are too afraid to run from before it kills you. The film, laced with social messages and glaring examples of yesterday's, today's and what were in deed tomorrow's problems did so with gusto and humor while giving you an example of Frankenstien's wet dream in modern technology. Upfront, in your face and riding the wave of Reaganomics, escalating drugs and domestic urban violence the film slaps you with all the sad truths of society with a slightly angry but honest view. If you can see the unrated version, do so. After all, does some extra bullets and blood and guts and brain matter really get offensive at this point? Not just a violent disturbing Sci-Fi film, one of the most surprising social conscience films you'll find. Sci-Fi epic... no bathroom breaks!" "With \"RoboCop\" director Paul Verhoeven and writers Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner brought one of the most memorable sci-fi characters of movie history to the big screen. Three years after the first \"Terminator\"-movie they created another cyborg to behold and although nerdy fanboys have often compared the two and computer games have been made where one battles the other, \"RoboCop\" is an entirely different beast than James Cameron's action/adventure. First and foremost Verhoeven's movie is a satire. A satire on themedia and the American way of life in the 80's during the Regan era. The violence in this film is so over the top it can hardly be taken serious. The news snippets that are strewn in between are little comedic sketches. I remember watching \"RoboCop\" as a child and not getting any of this. To me it was just a badass character at the time. And, of course, the movie still works that way, too. The set design is just awesome. Detroit looks run down and rotten. Every scenery is drenched in gray. That doesn't make the movie a downer, though. It just underlines the fact that law and order doesn't play a major role in this Detroit of the not too distant future. The clumsy (then: state-of-the-art) stop motion-special effects are charming and make one of RoboCop's opponents, the evil (or rather disturbed) robot ED-209 seem much more threatening than any modern CGI would. Finally, I have to mention the violence again. I don't think a big budget movie has gotten down to the nitty-gritty before or ever since. Verhoeven is just mad and one the loose. It's a delight. Not even the spectacular (in terms of body count and f/x) sequel could keep up with the bloodshed of its predecessor. \"RoboCop\" really grows on you, and if it may seem a bit dowdy through the cynical eyes of a grown up living in the 21st century, watch the movie again. And again. And again. Then you will start to feel like a child again watching this for the first time. You will fall in love with scenes like the classic Toxic Waste-incident or the classic \"Dick, you're fired!\"-moment. They just don't make balls to the wall-action movies like this one anymore. Bet'cha that the planned remake of \"RoboCop\" will not better this near masterpiece in any way." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Robocop is essentially two very important genres. In one aspect Robocop is superhero film for adults...a big R rating slapped on it. But it fits the genre. It shows the tragic event that creates the hero, it shows the hero busting random crime, and it shows the rise of a villain to face the hero. The cool thing about Robocop being a superhero film is that it was an original idea and not based on a comic book hero or already established story. Secondly Robocop is a prime example of the eighties action genre which is such an important genre that spawned Die Hard, Rambo, Terminator and every Schwarzenegger film made in his early career. Notoriously R Rated explode fests, blood soaked, four letter words ever and usually token nude scenes from big breasted ladies. Granted Robocop doesn't have any nude scenes remarkably but everything else it hits the mark on in a big way. But Robocop goes beyond both of these genres to really create something incredible that has kept the series going, bad or good in one way or another, for the last 2 decades. Creator and writer Edward Neumeier created this darkly comedic spoof on a future world complete with very tongue in cheek commercials and news reports that make you laugh and think at the same time. It doesn't take away from the film but yet gives the movie a certain edge. Despite seemingly being a last choice for the role Peter Weller turns in a very good performance. He carries the film just as well as any big name eighties actor could have done. Granted most of his acting is from inside the massive suit but that's even more of a challenge because he has to play droning and robotic but still have this emotional side that makes Robocop more than just an action flick and Weller definitely delivers in the role. Nancy Allen is terrific but I think very underused as Murphy's/Robocop's partner. She has this laid back quality to her character and yet she is honest and a strong female partner to Robocop. Ronny Cox is also terrific as Dick Jones, the corrupted senior partner in OCP, the company determined to take over the city any means necessary. Cox is the perfect adversary to Robocop and is the quintessential eighties villain. Miguel Ferrer is also great in a small role as the slimy Bob Morton who created Robocop to undermine Jones' ideas to take over the city. Finally Kurtwood Smith (yep Red Forman himself) is the insanely evil and unbalanced Clarence Boddicker. Boddicker is one of my favorite movie villains because he's completely nuts and the perfect bad guy. I would have loved to have seen him come back in future sequels. In many ways, and maybe it's because the current state of CGI and special effects but Robocop can seem very cheesy and yet at the same time the special effects are incredible. The film was nominated for three Academy Awards in editing and sound. Even the dialog and one liners seem campy but you never really notice it because you become so involved in this futuristic, dark, gritty world with this strange hero that you will be fascinated with. Robocop is an ultimate eighties classic no matter what bad rap it got for continuing in a less than stellar fashion. Over the next month or so I'm going to watch and review every piece of live action Robocop (3 movies, TV Series, and the fourth made for TV installment.) All of this is because I am enamored with the original. It's action packed, great performances, and an all around amazing sci-fi, action hero, film. SEE IT NOW!! 9/10" "A great sci-fi actioner, Robocop offers a bleak vision of a dystopian future by fusing together brutal excessive violence and clever social satire, taking a swipe at big-money corporations and incompetent cops. Paul Verhoeven shows that awareness of the growing interest in contemporary technological advancement is the only way to avoid moral and economic collapse in a crime-riddled society. To achieve this urban pacification a cyborg, Robocop, is created to violently dispose of crime and also corruption in near-future Detriot. Verhoeven uses graphic comic-book violence and sadistic scenes of brutal action to startling and sometimes comedic effect (the latter becoming apparent only after several viewings!). It has a great selection of classic action scenes everywhere. From the brutally dark and disturbing mauling of Murphy to the gross-out but funny sequences involving an OCP exec getting completely mullered by the faulty original law-enforcement design ED-209 (\"Somebody wanna call a goddamn paramedic!\") and a gang member falling into a vat of Toxic waste and then with his skin melting off getting decapitated on the front windscreen of a car! Over-the-top, disturbingly violent, hilarious and brilliantly made. 8/10" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Sometimes I think the 1980s is an underrated decade for movies. While it can't boast as many influential films as the early 1970s classics made by young prodigies, or the high-concept, gimmicky, technically superior films of the 90s or 2000s, the 80s can certainly be regarded as 'The Entertainment Decade'. Most movies of the 80s were fun! And ROBOCOP is much more than that. Whatever the message of ROBOCOP is (or not), it is totally entertaining, from beginning to end. At its bare bones, ROBOCOP is a good-versus-evil action drama of cops against criminals. At that level alone, it accomplishes a lot. It has great, gritty, technically executed action scenes w/o a lot of (if any) special effects. In terms of the real cops in this film and the street criminals, there is a clear delineation of good and evil. Cops: good. Criminals: bad. But underneath the surface, as I'm certain has been alluded to ad nauseaum, ROBOCOP, intentionally or unintentionally, is about more than good against evil, at least 'obvious' good (earnest, hard-working cops) against 'obvious' evil (blatant crime). The film is very prophetic. The scenes of news anchors switching between broadcasting technological advancements and violent crimes is eerily similar to what is going on today. Of course, there's the societal theme of the correlation between increasing technology and increased misuse of it, and that while technology advances, people seem to stay stagnant or to even regress in behavior. The biggest prophecy of ROBOCOP is of corporate greed and how corporations have been outsourced to take over things that should be handled by the government (law enforcement in this film). And by taking over, these corporations corrupt the core tenets of these institutions (today it is military) But in taking over these institutions, the corporations don't necessarily corrupt the 'soldier' of the institution, the cop in this film. And with all of that analysis above in what sounds like the description of a boring movie, ROBOCOP is still hugely entertaining. The basic story is that an ordinary, everyday Detroit beat cop Officer Alex Murphy (played by Peter Weller, more on him later) with wife and child, is on duty one day with his partner Officer Anne Lewis (well-played by Nancy Allen) and they try to arrest a bunch of experienced street thugs, but they fail and Murphy is brutally murdered by the thugs, led by Clarence Boddicker (played by Kurtwood Smith in a confident, lean performance). This scene was very brutal for 1987, and still disturbs. Boddicker delivers the fatal shot to Murphy in the head, then the film immediately cuts to a sequence of well-executed scenes of the ensuing months where Murphy is airlifted to the hospital, operated on, and transformed into ROBOCOP. In charge of all of this is corporate exec Bob Morton (played by Miguel Ferrer in the best performance of his career). Morton works for OCP, who have been 'outsourced' to run the Detroit police department. Robocop is Morton's brain-child of the perfect cop who can fight all crime and can't be stopped. And early on, Robocop can't be stopped. We get the obligatory scenes of Robocop fighting various crimes (grocery store robbery, a rape, a kidnapping) and get a taste of his technological (and human) abilities (built-in eye monitor to see from long range, assessing a situation to choose the best course of action, a targeting system to shoot with accuracy). All these scenes tie together nicely and are taut, suspenseful, and even funny. But something happens. Robocop starts to have the memories of his alter-ego Murphy and actually begins to 'think' for himself. He investigates Murphy's past life and finds out that he had wife, child, and was brutally murdered and proceeds to bring down the criminals who killed him. This is where my discussion of Peter Weller's performance comes in. This is not just a guy in a robot suit spouting off lines in a monotone manner. This is a fully convincing performance of a half-man, half-machine with remarkable abilities, but still with human thoughts, emotions, and instincts under the surface. And Weller pulls it off amazingly. There's not a false note in this performance. As Robocop starts to think for himself and bring down the criminals, Morton's boss at OCP Dick Jones (played by Ronny Cox in a totally convincing performance as a corrupt corporate big-wig) conspires with gang leader Boddicker to conversely bring down Morton and Robocop. And it is this sequence of events that makes the viewer begin to see the complexity in all the major villains (Morton is overly ambitious and a jerk, but he isn't lethal like Jones; Boddicker is a sleazy killer thug, but what does this make Jones, who arms Boddicker with the resources to take down Robocop? Jones is vengeful, but Morton forced him into it by disrespecting his position at OCP). Needless to say, it all comes down to a thrilling climax as Robocop, having been battered and bruised by Jones' own Robot 'cop' ED209 (a overly big, clunky, easily-fooled monstrosity), with a big time assist from Officer Lewis, has the big showdown with Boddicker and his gang at a steel mill. These final action scenes are exciting, with virtually no special effects, just lean, mean, clean action, done the old-fashioned way. The film has all the elements that any great action film should have: a sound story, action scenes with mounting tension and great set pieces (a la the gas station scene, my favorite of the film) and great choreography (the warehouse shootout, a beautifully executed scene), solid acting, a witty screenplay, memorable score, and great direction (by Paul Verhoeven, his best work IMHO). So what is ROBOCOP? Action flick? Sci-fi fantasy? Social satire? Prophetic vision of the future? I say all of the above. And you can add to that SHEER ENTERTAINMENT!" "I just watched Robocop for the first and was surprised at how much I liked it. I was really expecting a cheesy 80's flick with nothing else going for it but it's much more than that. I was thoroughly entertained the entire way through because it moves very well. I'm just disappointed that I waited so incredible long to finally see it. The acting is great, I really enjoyed Peter Weller and Nancy Allen and I felt like Weller did a great job of transforming his character into Robocop. The story is interesting and well written with some truly memorable scenes. What stands out most to me is probably the gore and special effects, they truly blew me away. I think this is a new favorite of mine. If you like Sci-fi/Action movies, this one is for you. I can almost guarantee that it will entertain you the entire way through. But seriously, stop reading this and watch it already!" "This movie is really unique in how it is done. It has also stood the test of time. Sure, Terminator movies are more popular, but RoboCop should be as popular, if not more popular than what people think. RoboCop has a more structured storyline to it than that of Terminator. Plus the character design is way cooler. The movie itself has great acting and there are many memorable catch phrases like \"Stay out of trouble\" and \"dead or alive your're coming with me\". The movie shows the plight of Detroit and the rise of crime. Thus, a man is built into a wrecking machine and gets sweet revenge on those who made him into what he is. I hope they revive this franchise someday. It deserves to be revived." "Paul Verhoeven is one of my favorite directors for the matter of how he makes almost all of his films action-packed but also seem like you're just watching T.V. at home. Robocop is no exception in what could easily be considered his action/sci-fi classic. In case you don't know the story here's how it works: an outstanding rookie known as Alex Murphy is brought into a new police department to crackdown on some dealers. Obviously, it doesn't end too well and the dealers capture Murphy and blast him to bits. Somehow, Murphy is rescued with the little life he has hanging on and transforms him into a cyborg that we now know as Robocop, the ultimate crime-fighting figure. The movie is fun to watch with exquisite visual effects for a film done in the eighties. The action is great, the storyline though somewhat cheesy remains entertaining and you only wish that the sequels were half as good." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "On paper, this movie has the appeal of a low budget movie. On screen, this movie just works. Robocop is a very popular science fiction movie that has developed a large fan following. In an unspecified time in the future, a newly transferred police officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is gunned down by a gang of thugs, led by Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith). Around the same time, Omni Consomer Products (OCP), takes control of the Detroit Police Department. A young executive Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer) leads the Robocop project of creating a 24 hour police officer to combat the crime problem in Detroit. While Robocop has been a success, Murphy's old memories surface and Murphy/Robocop seeks revenge against Boddicker and his gang. Robocop is assisted by his ex-partner Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen). At the same time, Robocop also uncovers corruption within OCP. There is a lot of satire and humour in this movie, which relates to real life. This is not just a straightforward sci-fi action movie, this is a very original and intelligent movie. It contains a lot of violence and gore, but this is what makes Robocop popular. It's a shame most of these actors have not gone on to do bigger and better things, particularly Peter Weller. Robocop 2 was good but not great, it seemed to focus on action and sadistic ultra violence, and the humour was lacking. Robocop 3 was largely disappointing and killed the franchise, as it seemed to appeal to younger audiences, making it less violent and completely removing all the foul language. The original Robocop is, and still is, the best movie in the series and as a sci-fi movie. 10/10."

"RoboCop - This is one of my favourite alltime films, and after seeing this last night, remains so. This is what film makers need to be looking at... even though it's a shallow Sci Fi movie, it's got more emotion in the characters (of which is a superb supporting cast)... incredible effects... Rob Bottin designing Robo is up there with Winston for Predator and Giger for Alien... it's that good. The musci by Basil Poulderis is simply perfect and with the set piece in the cocaine factory creates one of the greatest shootouts in cinema history with stunning choreography on Robo. Simply put this is one of not only the greatest bunch of Sci Fi films ever... it's one of THE best films ever. Well done Verhoven! 10/10" "This film to me has not dated -= in fact the frightening thing is that it echoes what is happening now - from news readers smiling about commercials for the 'SUX' and then shooting to the next story about '300 deaths in central America' (pp)... We even have police officers threatening to strike in the u|k at the moment!! But the film is also so quotable and there are very strong performances - esp from Kurtwood smith \"Can you fly bobby!\" The action scenes are spot on and the violent is very violent - which it should be... the other main star of this is Basil poledouris's music - it is fab and drives the films action and emotive scenes!! Rock on robo!!!" "Robocop deserve better audience then it did it was a fun movie , a misunderstood hero . Peter Weller was great as Robocop , the directing was near perfect , settings was fantastic , since everyone is doing make overs as it were , Battlestar Galactica , Star Trek ; anyone listening out there? A new Robocop ? We need more heroes these days . why not a new Robocop ? Peter Jackson would you do it? Everybody was great , the best . in Robocop . Good job ,well done . Rkallao. Why not Dean Cain as Robocop ? He has the built just like Peter Weller did , but Dean is a lot younger then when Peter did it , imagine what Dean Cain could do as Robocop ?" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Brilliant, Robocop changed an audience's view of action/sci-fi films! Even the storyline of Robocop is engaging, the Detroit police force incapable of stemming crime in the city turn to their city sponsors, OCP (Omni Consumer Products)to find a solution. Their solution to revive a dead cop called Murphy and turn him into an unstoppable machine, who serves the public trust and protects the innocent! The action of the film also caught people's attention, even though to some it was too extreme! I didn't think that! Robocop keeps you watching even when you begin to tire of the action scenes of Robocop stopping a criminal, the constant aroma of techno science-fiction never ceases to amaze me and other watchers!" "A lot of compliments can be paid to such a movie. It really follows no genre, and the writers and director made their own rules. This is action packed, humor packed, coolness packed, emotion packed sizzle! It follows several factions. One is Detroit's bankrupt and fading police force who can't even help when one cop, Murphy, is brutally murdered by a second faction, a group of engaging and amusing deliciously evil bad guys who will make you hate them and laugh with them at the same time. A third faction, a super large corporation of bigwig Bill Gates types who run the city, create the new mechanized crime fighter. But there again, we have some outstanding, yet at the same time, hilarious, conflict. There are scenes involving the bloodsucking members of the corporation that are classic. In fact there are classic scenes throughout this movie in every little frame. A man wets his own pants trying to escape a bathroom. A genial kindly old man witnesses a fellow board member being gunned down mercilessly and tells the man responsible \"I am very disappointed.\" There are little commercials and bits which the characters watch on TV that add spice. The language is harsh, but hilarious and needed for this type of movie. In the toned down version, the leader of the bad guys storms into a room and says \"Ladies leave!\" Huh? The original was much more effective. Try to get the uncensored version for the full effect." "Its a dark time in Detroit. Crime overrules the city. Meanwhile, OCP buys the police force and starts experimenting around with robots. Then they create ROBOCOP. Hes indestructible, unstoppable, and furious. Besides being a robot, he starts having flashbacks about his past. Excellent movie, well worth watching. Phil Tippit's amazing ED-209 really makes the movie. Smart script, action and occasional humor spin into one. WARNING: This is an incredibly violent picture. But its still good. Hey! Its got Red from 'That 70's Show' in it, how can you go wrong? Script: 20 (30%) Acting: 35 (40%) Effects: 20(20%) Music: 10 (10%) ----- 85% = 9" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This is an awesome film. The acting is awesome and very believable. I've seen both the unrated and the R rated version of the film and the unrated version is better, in which Alex Murphy's death is more violent (which can be a good thing). Kurtwood Smith, did a fabulous job as Clarence, the crime lord of Detroit. Peter Weller did a fabulous job as Alex Murphy and Robocop, especially when trying to find out who he was before he became Robocop. The special effects are very good, considering the time when this film was made. If you enjoy sci-fi films, action films, or movies with lots of violence, then this movie is for you." "They don't make them like this anymore! A classic of the genre, Robocop is shocking, violent, but an absolutely compelling film. A film like this could never be made in the present-day politically correct environment, and I don't believe that is a good thing. Robocop is a frightening insight into a dystopian future where large corporations run rough shod over society, completely devoid of benevolence, a profit is far more important to them than social cohesion and even human life. Unrealistic? I don't think so, especially not in a country like the USA. Some of the violence is extremely gratuitous, particularly Murphy's murder and the ED209 massacre, but the movie wouldn't be the same without it. That said, I wouldn't recommend this movie for children. The media reporting of Casey Wong I thought was brilliant, as well as the advertisements. Fantastic satire on consumer culture and where we might be headed. Acting was first rate, particularly Dick Jones and Clarence Boddicker, wow, these guys were brilliant. Although the special effects are clearly outdated, particularly with ED209 scenes, this movie has truly stood the test of time. After nearly 20 years Robocop is still far superior to the nonsense action movies put out today which might contain flashy special effects but fail to capture anything like the suspense and power of this film. As stated earlier, truly one of the best of its genre: Brilliant movie, I give it 9 out of 10 stars" "Having seen this movie about 10 years ago it seems that quite a few things about the story have either come true or could possibly come true maybe 10 years down the road. Although not mentioned in this movie (the worst drug imaginable \"nuke\" was prevalent in Robocop 2, there is quite a bit of drug referencing and could be referring to our problems today with \"ice\". This film is extremely violent but it is a foretaste of what life will be like in the near future. It was good to see that there is still a \"human\" element to Robocop. The writer realizes that you still need some compassion and empathy even in technology. If you don't, you might end up with a situation like the one in this trilogy, or worse you could be staring down the barrel of the \"Terminator\" scenario. This movie has some great acting and the company in the movie reminds us of quite a few companies which will remain nameless to avoid lawsuits." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "If you haven't already seen this movie, do yourself a favour. Sit down with an open mind and remember that it's not just another shallow 80's gun-fest, but rather a fantastic deeply funny satire. And while it is very funny, and excessively violent, there is a lot of emotional weight behind it that drives the story forward. Robocop is a great movie that works on so many levels and can be viewed in any number of ways. It's got satire, sci-fi, ultra-violence, rich imagery, great acting, black comedy, heart... I love this film and it's as relevant today as it was back in 87. Peter Weller does a great job and by putting such an actor in the lead role is just one of the many elements that makes this film so much more than violent sci-fi hokum. Paul Verhoeven directs brilliantly. This movie comments on everything from America's love affair with violence and justice, to the danger of society ruled by \"big business\". Robocop really deserves to be ranked alongside the likes of The Terminator and Blade Runner. Not to be missed."

"classic sci fi movie. In my mind, the best sci fi movie there is. It is great on all fronts: acting, directing, storytelling, script, action, pacing. From the news flashes and goofy commercials to the graphic violence and graphic language, this was a head turning cult hit. The real treat here were the bad guys in the movie, they were real sinister and evil. Kurtwood Smith will always be Clairence to me, I don't give a damn if he was in 'That 70s Show' and Ronny Cox was just as good a villain too. RoboCop has some sharp action for its time but it was also emotional on many levels. When Murphy gets killed in the warehouse, it was so violent and butchering that it made you that much more of a fan of RoboCop through the movie as he really just goes and picks off each of the goons that killed him earlier. Some good twist and turns, many story lines through the movie that fell into place very smoothly. It produced 2 other sequels but nothing nearly as good as this one. A real gem. They don't make movies like this anymore, its a real shame." "Although on the surface, a good guys vs bad guys flick, this movie exists at several levels at once. Sci\\fi, comedy, action etc.... However, I believe that this is a story about a man who is on a search for his very being. HAving been reduced to a machine, he spends the entire movie trying to find out who he is. The answer to \" Good shooting son, what's your name?\", is the penultimate moment. This is why Robocop 2 ehhh and rebook 3 yuck, were uneeded. The action flick nature of Robocop is a vehicle for Murphy's rediscovery. Murphy is never intended to be a superhero. Great movie, and an example of where they should have \"left good enough alone\"" "Robocop is an exceptional film, it combines the themes of a comedy, sci-fi, action, and even moments which leave you feeling sorry for characters in the movie, personally i love it how the society in which the movie is based-on is modelled by a corporate domination of both civil rights and public authority, robocop is a kind of 'final-solution' to inhibit the people of this society from plunging into total-anarchy, and the evil-minded yet calm and bipolar corporate bosses are willing to use any magnitude of force to stop an uprising from the people. This film will bring any new viewer extreme excitement, and laughter, it has it's fair share of brutally explicit slaughter scenes, but that's half of the fun." "RoboCop is just about as close as you can get to the perfect sci-fi action movie. With Paul Verhoeven behind it, RoboCop gives us a gritty and depressing look at a violent future. Speaking of violence, this is an ultra-violent film that is not for the squeamish. Blood, guts, and body parts fly in all directions, which is what we've come to expect from Mr. Verhoeven. The action sequences are wonderfully over-the-top. You couldn't ask for any more huge explosions, intense car crashes, or crackling shootouts (all about the shootout at the cocaine factory). Peter Weller is perfect as RoboCop. No one could've played him better. And that's final. Ronny Cox and Kurtwood Smith are excellent as the villains...you just can't wait for them to get stabbed in the neck. The score is one of the most memorable in movie history and you will be humming it for days. The cinematography is top-notch as well. To sum up: great action, great story, great music, GREAT FUN! You go Robo!" "Verhoeven has made an ultra violent movie that plays out before your eyes like a smooth ride. The script tells of a near-future society where violence and power rules and big-government and media has taken over and might even have fused. They need a miracle to stomp out the violence and create order, and to do that they take the body of a slain cop hero and turn him into Robocop. But something remains of the human that used to be Murphy, and as it turns out this element is enough for Robocop to turn against his creators and get to the real roots of the problems. The bad guys have no redeeming qualities and are dispatched off in the worst ways. How does a bath in toxic waste sound like? This movie also has none of the American patriotism and what-not. Paul Verhoeven is a Dutchman, and has no sympathies in any of those directions. It is just an ultra violent near-future version of the world as we know it. This movie is a comedy, but it is not easy to spot it. That is one of the things that makes it so good." "\"RoboCop\" is your average graphic comic book brought to life.The characters act like the kind of characters you may find in a graphic comic book.The setting of the film is urban,futuristic and grim.Set in Detroit,1997,Peter Weller is a cop who is killed in the line of duty and is then transformed in to a crime fighting machine by a corrupt corporation.This film does have its moments in terms of violence and action.\"RoboCop\" is a riot and a lot of fun to watch.This is the best film of 1987.And as I said before,the most violent of 1987. Revenge is told with such glee in this film and the special effects are amazing.The power of \"RoboCop\" not only comes from its violence or visual effects,but from its look of a futuristic detroit.I was 16 when I had seen this film back in 1988 and I was deeply effected by this film.It's not that often that you will come up upon a film like \"RoboCop\"." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "I first watched RoboCop at a very young age. At the time, I loved it, because of the fact that RoboCop was just a cool robot who completely wiped out the bad guys. Now I watch it, and see the other side that makes this such a masterpiece - the satire. The film is basically a mouthpiece for the criticisms of privatisation in the 1980s, and how it would lead to the problems of the future. Many of the news reports and the adverts are done so well, as both a piece of satire and in their creation, that you can't help but commend them. One thing that has horrified many people since the film's release, is the amount of violence in the film. The body count is very high, and the film contains some of the most disturbing scenes in film history - I could never watch killing of Murphy at the start, nor the part where one of the characters is covered in toxic waste. In essence, RoboCop is a film that MUST be seen. The satire, violence, comedy, and unique character of RoboCop make this a film that will last for a long time." "Robocop is, in one persons humble opinion, one of the great underrated films of the 1980's. On it's surface, Robocop looks like a straight action movie, with a slight science fiction bent. But peel back the layers, and you find a biting satire, covering multiple targets, from 1980's corporate and popular culture to action movies themselves. Opening in near future Detroit, we are introduced to the world of Robocop via a fast-paced television news program dubbed \"MediaBreak\" (It's motto \"Give us 3 minutes, we'll give you the world\"). What we see isn't pretty: Terrorists have seized Acapulco, white supremacy government in South Africa has a nuclear weapon (one aspect that dates the film), the Star Wars nuclear program is in full swing, and over 40 police officers in Detroit have been murdered by crime boss Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith). The Detroit police force has recently been privatized and is being run by uber-corporation Omni Consumer Product (OCP), and the recent police deaths has the force threatening a strike. OCP senior vice president Dick Jones (Ronny Cox) is about to introduce a new law enforcement robot, ED-209, but a malfunction during a demonstration of ED-209 gives junior corporate officer Robert Morton (Miguel Ferrer) an opening to pitch his pet project, dubbed Robocop, to the \"Old Man\" (Daniel O'Herlithy). At the same time, in a remote Detroit police precinct, officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) has just been transferred in and quickly finds himself in a bank robbery chase with his new partner Lewis (Nancy Allen). The chase leads to Murphy being captured by the robbers, led by Boddicker, who shoot Murphy down and leave him for dead. But he isn't quite gone. His brain and face are removed and used as the basis for Robocop: a half human, half robot police cyborg, complete with titanium outer skin and onboard computer memory to allow for recording of his activity. Robocop begins cleaning up crime on Detroit's dangerous streets, but an encounter with one of the gang that murdered him awakens memories within Robocop of his previous life, causing distress to his OCP handlers. With its title, and a very sci-fi, comic-style look for it's main character, it might be easy to dismiss Robocop as kids stuff, but the reality is much different. Robocop is a film that earned it's hard-R rating, featuring copious amounts of violence, language and occasional nudity, but it all serves a purpose. The 1980s saw the height of the action movie, with grander and more ridiculous sequences in action films multiplying with each passing year. Robocop is very much a reaction to that, and it's over the top violence is pushed to such extremes that it starts being funny. Screenwriters Ed Neumier and Michael Minor and director Paul Verhoeven push the boundaries of a standard action film in terms of violence and quickly makes other action films look as ridiculous as they really often are. But Robocop doesn't stop there. It comments on the dwindling attention span of television viewers (the brilliant MeidaBreak segments), television advertising (including commercials for a brand of artificial hearts as if they were items in a supermarket) and, most importantly, the explosion of corporate culture and public services falling under private control. Few key social issues that were hot buttons in the 1980's are left unaddressed in this film, and each new issue introduced makes a strong impression. Robocop isn't interested in just providing us with an action tale, it has an underlying message to go along with it. Most importantly, there is no self-aggrandizing or heavy-handed dialog and speeches to accompany this material. Viewers are left to pick up on it themselves. But, that being said, Robocop is actually a more rousing action film than many of it's counterparts that it is ridiculing. Most of Robocop's action scenes are well-produced and exciting, especially later in the film. It also helps that Minor and Neumier don't spare the character development. Robocop is a tragic character, a man who's life is cut short, who is deprived of his human body and most of his past, yet haunted by visions of his previous existence. He cannot truly reconcile the two, and some of the film's strongest scenes are ones in which Robocop revisits his old house only to become enraged by the fact that everything he remembers that was good is gone. On the acting front, there are two key standouts: Peter Weller and Kurtwood Smith. Weller has a tough job, getting us to care about a character that is covered in a giant metal suit and has limited facial expressions. But when the necessary moments arrive, Weller delivers, instilling his character with pathos. He pulls it off often with only a quarter of his face revealed. Smith creates a memorable film villain, his Clarence Boddicker so vicious, rude and vile you can't help but hate him. Prior to his role on That '70s Show, Robocop was Smith's most recognized work, and with good reason. It is unfortunate that time has not been kind to the Robocop character and the franchise in general. Two mediocre sequels, a short-lived television series and a quartet of Canadian-produced TV movies have done to the original film what the multiple Jaws sequels did to Steven Spielberg's initial masterpiece, they diminished it. But, if you strip away all the excess baggage that these other distractions provide, Robocop is still a great film, and one that should be better remembered." "This movie was released in the United States in 1987, but when I first enjoyed it here in Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico it was in the autumn of 1988 and I have never heard of it before, I didn't know why I never see any trailers. so when I watched it completely shocked me and amazed me and so far i have seen it maybe 30 times. All the main actors I have been following their careers very closely, I have been feeling very much appreciation and endearment with them, even the bad guys Kurtwood Smith,Jesse Goins, Ray wise, Paul McCrane Calvin Jung and Ronny Cox. The entire movie was full of emotion and spectacular stuff, pretty fast scenes one after another, the extreme violence hits really hard.Congratulations to Paul Verhoeven for his great science fiction movie, a total masterpiece." "I recently saw this for the first time, and loved it. Well, not exactly the first time I've see it, but the first time I've seen it start to finish. I've tried to watch this dozens of times, and for whatever reason I always get interrupted. Anyway, what an awesome movie! This has everything that a good action movie needs: Kurtwood Smith makes for an awesome villain, plus there's some semi-unexpected plot twists that I found pretty cool. Not to mention the awesome effects for the time. Though I singled out Kurtwood Smith, almost the entire cast does well in their roles. Peter Weller will and has gone down in history for his role as the title character, and well he should have! The ED-209 scene really caught me off guard, and I loved it. Overall, I say if you like action movies and haven't seen this....GO BUY IT NOW!!! I assure you that you wont be disappointed! 9/10" "Add another review" "Find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your Watchlist and rate your favorite movies and TV shows on your phone or tablet!")("Movies, TV & Showtimes" "Celebs, Events & Photos" "News & Community" "Watchlist" "" "Find industry contacts & talent representation" "Manage your photos, credits, & more" "Showcase yourself on IMDb & Amazon" "Sign in with Facebook Other Sign in options" "Own the rights?" "I had never seen this until 2006, I popped it in the DVD player and all of a sudden there was a stop motion machine that didn't look very real but still gave the affect it was aiming to give. Murphy (the man before he became Robocop) was the type of guy that seemed very likable so I felt sorry for him once he had died and was reincarnated in to a mindless robot. I must say that Robocop does have ultra violence but I never get tired of it. Robocop is the type of movie that I would buy and watch a couple of times before I would become bored of it because it so entertaining and never boring. If you have never seen Robocop I strongly advise you to because I promise you that you will not be disappointed. In conclusion, Robocop is very good and entertaining but don't expect out of this world special effects. Robocop can at times be annoying but after a while he grows on you." "I have finally seen this movie, its awesome!! I know I usually have to close an eye or maybe two if it considers special effects in movies from the 80's but this one is definitely not one of them. Good special effects! Very good sound effects too, the walking of robocop is really scary. I loved that scene too when robocop finally comes alive, It remembers me of \"the matrix\" although this movie is much older. The acting is very good, I have seldom seen movies where every villain plays his role well, but here is one! This movie does indeed contain quite some violence, quite some!!! So maybe it was good that I haven't seen it back then in the 80's. It never annoys though. The film keeps tension well reserved and I had the feeling that the movie was longer than the given 100 minutes or so? So my final question remains, why weren't robocop 2 (and maybe 3 too) not directed by paul verhoeven as well? Even today This movie is a masterpiece!!!" "A cop, Murphy, transfers to a new precinct in a bad part of town and is soon killed brutally in the line of duty. Coincidentally a totalitarian company, that owns the Police Dept, is developing a project for a cyborg policeman and Murphy is just intact enough to be revived as Robocop, the city's most effective enforcer of law. However, Robocop first doesn't know about his past as a human, but he soon begins to uncover it, along with plenty of corruption in the city. Verhoeven mayhem ensues. The story gives a nice focus to not only the action scenes, but to a cyborg discovering its former human-self. The common theme of man vs. machine is addressed from an unusual perspective here as the main character is really neither robot, nor human. Other, though equally respectable films, like The Terminator, draw a line in black and white: human is good, machine is bad. This interesting story angle should be enough for fans of science fiction to check watch this movie. The other part of the story is a futuristic satire about just how powerful we should let our big corporations be and just how much we should let them get away with. Robocop is a representation this is his often brutal, albeit effective, methods of dealing with criminals which all go without complaint. Also deserving mention are the special effects. They are top notch considering 1987 restraints for them. Obviously dated by now, but they are quite elaborate and the production did a good job of putting them together with nothing being digital. So, all in all, this is a good watch. 8/10 Rated R: a lot of graphic violence, and profanity" "My absolute favorite movie! #1 I have watched it over 200 times and love it! The 2 main sequels are OK and the others are just awful but the 1st really hits the mark with me. I saw it opening day and since purchased all version on DVD and watch it regularly. I was thrilled when my son wanted to watch it. I think it is on of the most original, brutal and funny movies ever. Oddly, I find myself quoting it often. \"... give that man a hand!\", \"... just give my f~n phone call\", \" I am a repeat offender... I repeat... I will offend again..\" See, I do love this film, everyone should watch it at least once." "Yes, that's right. Best Movie Ever. One of the best sci-fi movies of its own or any other time, ROBOCOP features a plot that, while it does find itself with a few little pot holes and gaps, flows smoothly enough for the true purpose to come through. For the most part, it's more about violence than anything. The plot holds its own to the extent that it does draw into various violent encounters, which in the end, are the entertaining factor of the movie. Amazingly low-budget, no truly big names, with a director who most people have never heard of- it still manages to be my favorite movie of all time. ROBOCOP 2 is just alright, with seemingly vast filler, and ROBOCOP 3 is just an attempt to market new action figures and should be sealed away and burned." "It is set in Detroit, in an unknown but quite near future. Capitalism has went beyond the limits of anyone's imagination. It has touched even the police and space agencies, all of these under control of Omni Consumer Products. OCP for short, it is a firm with HUGE ambitions: it attempts to create new city-- Delta City is the name-- from the ashes of the chaotic and crime-ridden Detroit. After failed attempts of creating a strong police force (loosing about 5 guys every week) or a good enforcement droid (ED-209, a bulky, 10-metres-tall droid kills an executive during testing), Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer), a young scientist and OCP corporate proposes a solution: the creation of a Robocop. He finally gets his candidate when Alex Murphy (Peter Weller), an honest and highly competent police officer gets brutally slaughtered by a sadistic group led by Clarence Boddicker. 40 days later, he is brought back to life as a crime-fighting cyborg. After a series of successful tests, OCP finds its popularity soaring and its position secured. But, after a months, things go somewhat awry as Robocop recalls his human past, and tells him to get revenge on the criminals that killed him... Loud, ultra violent sci-fi cop movie never lets up for a minute. One of the earliest of the cyborg craze that followed the Terminator, this movie stands out from its role model and its countless rip-offs. The story is slick and+ has the right combination of action and humour. the Special effects are eye-popping (with many nominations from various institutions), even by today's standards (ED-209 animation and Robo's first-person view, to name a few) and they make the movie entertaining. Peter Weller endured physical torture of sweating buckets in the costume, and He sure pulls it off: He makes this clunky , bulky machine look and act human, even more than at the first quarter of the movie in which he is ACTUALLY a human being. Despite these advantages, the movie is just a bit too short (99 mins PAL, 103 at NTSC format). There are not enough humane scenes to camouflage the movie's sometimes disturbingly dark and bleak view of the future, and Nancy Allen's performance is not exactly one of her best. But still, it's a lot of fun and it's one of the best sci-fi films of the '80s. *** out of ****" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Somewhere in the near future a cop, Alex Murphy (Peter Weller), gets shot by a punch of sadistic cop killer in his first day in new precinct. Omni Consumer Product, a company that owns the police takes his mortally wounded body and revives him as a mean, lean law-enforcement machine (drumm roll here) RoboCop. The OCP technicians thick they've erased Murphys memory, but soon a friendly face, a female cop Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen) recognizes him and soon they start their chase against the killers of Murphy. RoboCop was, and still is very good action film, despite of the fact, that age is showing through from the special effects, like military/police robot ED-209, which movements can't be even compared to modern day specials. But all this, and the overall comic book like plot, gives the movie its own charming look, making it fun to watch. Well okay, maybe fun is in some places of the film a wrong word, as most of the action scenes are a bit sadistic, Murphys Killing in the beginning, and bloody, every thing else in the action department. RoboCop also has a more satirical element in it, mainly pointed against capitalism: OCP, a company, which owns the police, mock up commercials, etc. As small funny element there's this small criticism towards violence in entertainment, when a family is shown playing a Nuclear War board game. but then again RoboCop IS violent entertainment. But I strongly want to note, that this movie is not meant to the smallest members of your family. I dare to say this movie is action classic." "I remember first seeing 'RoboCop' when I was about 8 or so. I do believe my reaction was: \"Cool! Robots!\". Now as my last months of being a teenager creep up on me, I watch 'RoboCop' and say \"Cool! Robots!\". How little I've changed... In the near future, Detroit is suffering from high crime rates and corruption. The Police force is saved by the private OCP corporation. Naturally, OCP is in the business of building killer robots that resemble miniature versions of the robots in 'Robotech'. Enter Alex Murphy (Peter Weller), a cop new to Detroit who dies nearly as soon as he's introduced. However, when you work for a company in the business of designing killer robots, the chances that you'll be brought back to life as a near-invincible, crime-fighting, super-robot are pretty high, and thus the near-invincible, crime-fighting, super-robot RoboCop is born. For a story about a near-invincible, crime-fighting, super-robot, 'RoboCop' is at least pseudo-intellectual. We given a future, with no definite date, that is slowly creeping up on us. A future that I think we'd all prefer to avoid. However, I learned a much more valuable lesson: robots seek vengeance too. No, I'm not going to be hooked by a warning of a dystopian-future. On the other hand, robots that seek vengeance... Now that's a different story altogether. I can't believe 'RoboCop' didn't leave more of an impression on me when I first saw it. I saw 'Aliens' at the same time, and I was freaked out for a year. Now when I watch 'RoboCop' I'm making my own tally, trying to figure out if the \"Bodycount: 30\" entry on the trivia page is accurate. 'RoboCop' is rather violent. I'm surprised I even managed to see it when I was so young, but I guess that's what kids do: watch awesomely violent action movies. The action scenes are awesomely cool - what more would you expect from a near-invincible, crime-fighting, super-robot? 'RoboCop' is a fine action film. It has some nice story elements for those who would consider it a 'Terminator' rip-off, but I am a devotee of the action genre, and 'RoboCop' is one of the greats - 9/10" "Robocop is a first-rate, first-class, superior sci-fi/action movie classic. This movie can only be described as 'overkill'and that's why we love it. Unrestrained violence, eccentric characters,abusive foul language, an uncompromising setting, these are just some of the ingredients that round off this rare gem of a film. This film was made in the pre-C.G.I era, so that makes the film even more of an accomplishment. Go and buy a copy of \"the directors cut\" of ROBOCOP because everybody should have it in their DVD collection. Unfortunately this film was followed by two defective and substandard sequels. ROBOCOP 2 was a completely inadequate follow-up and ROBOCOP 3 was a weak and fraudulent third chapter. However, the original stands as a true testament to exemplary sci-fi/action cinema." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "When honest cop Murphy is gunned down by gangland villains, he becomes the subject of a new pioneering technique to replace the police with robots. However, the human part of his mind still survives, goes after the villains who shot him and effectively ended his human life. Much more than simply an action film (though Robocop is filled with great action sequences), this is a look into the future of humanity. The de-humanising of the police, who are controlled by OCP, a big corporation who put no value on human life as long as they make money, and aren't above employing cop-killers to swat anyone who irritates them, is a genuinely disturbing thought. The heroes and villains of the film are all strong characters. The scene in which Murphy/Robocop takes his mask off and looks at his battle-scarred face in a reflective surface, accompanied by an atmospheric soundtrack, still sticks in my mind."

"*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "i don't know how i came to like robocop so much but i think it's part of my love for campy sci-fi and bleak futures. this movie is what i consider to be the greatest interpretation of he near future than any other movie. this is beating out a clockwork orange, blade runner and judge dredd. wait, scratch the last one, which sucked. back in 88 it some parts seemed too unreal, but now, those same parts aren't even funny anymore, because they're too real! the robotic heart- now exists. street police with body armor- now exists. the over aggressive businessmen- now exist. and i believe that if there ever was a cyborg cop, he wouldn't be all kool and like the matrix with wires everywhere and all high-tech and dark looking, he would look like robocop, and probably be called something similar if not exactly the same. this movie is smarter and more emotional than would be expected from a movie of it's title, is the classic man vs machine storyline with the twist that it takes place inside one person. as for the sequels, i love the second one. i think it has everything a sequel should, though not as good as the first, gives you a taste of robocop kicking ass. as for the third. ummmm. it might have been good had they gotten peter Weller. if they just put his voice in this movie it would make it twice as good, though suck it does. robocop rules. the main argument against it being \"it's too corny\" to which i say \"yeah, well that's what's real\". or is it? yes it is. isn't it? yes. ? ." "ROBOCOP is a future that is all too believable. With crime rampant and a company running law enforcement ROBOCOP is the hero whose gun never misses. The streets run red with blood as Robocop patrols the slums of Detroit. Robocop is a smart persons action film. ROBOCOP is written with darker than dark humor and moments which explore the half man half robots remaining humanity. One thing ROBOCOP is not is boring. The film has a steady pace which is more than enough to keep those with short attention spans awake. Adding to the believability of the film is the modern look of the surroundings. The only fantasy element in the film are the robots everything else is present day looking. The fantasy in the film never loses focus and never detracts from the film. Some films get drowned in the fantasy and fantasy elements. This one dosen't. I recommend this film but please keep in mind it has graphic violence." "You know at the club scene when Robocop is about to arrest Leon Nash?Right when Leon pulls the gun out of his pocket, Robocop knocks it out of his hand. Some dude with long gray hair catches it. Was that the director?" "Gratuitously violent, a satire of America of the future, a Christ metaphor, a tragic undercurrent over the notion of losing humanity and family and a villain who dies by melting and then being run over by a car. It may not sound like a brilliant film, but it is. Paul Verhoeven's RoboCop is right up there with Cameron's The Terminator in that it is a perfect piece of nostalgic entertainment, a film that is a representation of what was so brilliant about the 80's. Many budding reviewers that write about the film will always touch on the satirical matters of the film, and they are brilliant, especially in their regard to the representation of television, from the manner that the news is delivered to the entertainment that is offered (\"I'd buy that for a dollar\"). But where this film really touches me is in it's story. Paul Verhoeven may be a man of excess (just take a look at the level of violence in the director's cut of the film) but the way he brings across the story of Murphy marks it out as the finest film he has directed. Whereas Basic Instinct, Starship Troopers and The Hollow Man were all to wrapped up in showing us controversial and violent material, here he counterbalanced that philosophy with the emotional undercurrent. When RoboCop starts to learn more of his life when he was Murphy (brilliantly shown when he revisits his previous home) Verhoeven pushes the emotional buttons without dipping into sentimentality. The film has a heart and soul that is very genuine and that really tugs at you. I dare you not to be shouting \"Murphy\" at the end of the film. Of course it is the quality of the production that makes this film so brilliant and the performances. It makes one wonder how Peter Weller never became a bigger star, with his fine work here clearly in abundance. Ronny Cox and Kurtwood Smith are fantastic as the villains, with Smith's Nazi like Clarence Bodicker being a real stand out. Then there is the fantastic make up from Rob Bottin. Everything from the RoboCop suit and the melting effects done of Paul McCrane still standing up today in an era full of CGI. Plus I couldn't do this review without mentioning the fantastic music of Basil Poledouris. No 80's synthesisers here, a wonderful sweeping orchestra that is moving and sad and brings pathos and optimism to a fantastic package. To quote Emil, \"I LIKE IT\"." "Robocop is one of those 8o's action movies that you could watch over and over. I think Peter Weller has that uncanny robot voice and is perfect even though he couldn't act himself out of a paper bag. It is too bad they had to spoil this great action classic with some lousy sequels." "One of the greatest cult classics that has ever come about. This movie is made great by all things in it. Any movie with a ford taurus that has a 350 engine and front wheel drive is great. Robocop is fueled by almost as much great one liners than the king of one liners himself, who we all know to be Arnold. Robocop is a positive roll model for all youngsters growing up in todays society. When Robocop takes out Dick jones, he is showing that he is what is left that is good in society. E.D.-209 can gladly replace my dog any day. If every house had a devoted protector such as E.D.-209 then everyone could sleep at ease. Children could wake early Christmas morning play fetch with E.D.-209. Spouses could enjoy a soothing cup of coffee on the couch in a room lit by the fire place as E.D.-209 sits in defense ready stance on the rug infront of the mantal. E.D.-209 should be sold at pet stores round the world. Of course no one can truly experience Robocop with out getting inside and seeing all of the Robocop saga. You must see Robocop, Robocop 2, Robocop 3, Robocop: Prime Directives, which are Robocop Dark Justice, Robocop Meltdown, Robocop Ressurection, and Robocop Crash and Burn. There should be a Robocop doll by every childs bed that they can cuddle with in the night." "Peter Weller stars as Alex J. Murphy a mortally wounded police officer who is turned into a cyborg policeman, who fights crime in Detroit and decides to take revenge on the sadistic gang that murdered him in this powerful, violent and funny classic. Robocop has to be one of the ultimate superhero movies to date, it contains sharp satire and eye catching actionscenes, plus a first rate script. Peter Weller is extremely sympathetic in the part." "I remember when the trailers for this came out. When the voice-over intoned \"RoboCop- the Future of Law Enforcement!\" Everyone in the theater laughed. What a stupid title! But then it hit the screen and man, was it great! I bought it on DVD a while back and it was worth every dollar I spent. I truly love the satirical aspects of the film and how it savages the corporate-yuppie \"Greed is good\" lifestyle that did so much to disfigure the 1980s. The dialogue is great, too- I especially like the scene where Emil Antonowsky (Paul McCrane) says \"Hey, wait a minute! I know you- you're DEAD! We KILLED YOU! WE KILLED YOU!\" And then there was the hilarious \"Dave\" bit. My co-workers and I still yell the line, \"I'D BUY THAT FOR A DOLLAR!\" at one another!" "This film is really well made and everyone should check it out. This film has good action and a little sense of humor. The story is very good. Murphy/Robocop dies on his first day of the job and his body gets used for the Robocop program. So he is like brought back to life. After he becomes Robocop, his memory gets blanked so he won't remember his life. I like the way he goes and finds out who he was and who killed him. He also finds the bad guy in OCP who wants to destroy him. The music is good too and fits in with the theme of the movie. If you really like Sci-Fi films you will like this one. 10 stars for the movie." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "******Warning, Spoilers******** The 1980's, for all its faults, was surely a golden age for intelligent sci-fi/action films - think The Terminator, Aliens and Predator. 1987's Robocop sits comfortably alongside these films as a classic of the genre. Despite the bucketloads of gore and a title which is absolutely ridiculous if one stops to think about, this is a film with heart and soul, and most importantly a message. Paul Verhoeven, directing his first US film, brings the critical eye of an outsider to the me-first decade, and uses the films futuristic setting to lampoon 80's corporate America for all it's worth. Everything bad about yuppie culture is taken to extremes - executives assassinate one another, are involved with organised crime, and see the fact that a fellow exec has been turned into a hamburger by a psychopathic robot as a 'temporary setback'. This is Wall Street with cyborgs and a wicked sense of humor. What's amazing about this film is how tightly scripted it is. It clocks in at just 102 minutes, not one of which is wasted. Verhoeven cleverly uses fictional TV news and commercials to build the world the characters inhabit (a technique he would reuse to lesser effect in Total Recall and Starship Troopers), thereby dispensing with the need to have lots of long winded exposition scenes. These segments are where the films satire goes into overdrive - kids play with a high tech version of battleships called Nuke-Em' (\"Get them before they get you!\"), a car named a 6000 SUX is advertised, and a Star Wars strategic defence 'peace platform' incinerates Santa Barbera. The storyline itself is pretty standard comic book stuff - cop gets shot up and turned into cyborg and then has to regain his humanity, but it's told so well, and in such a brilliantly realised setting, that its elevated above its pulp origins. The cast all turn in decent performances, particularly Kurtwood Smith as over-the-top baddie Clarence Boddicker. Also, if you've only ever seen Nancy Allen in Carrie, her turn as ass-kicking cop Ann Lewis is an eye opener. The violence, while extreme (even more so in the directors cut), is more often than not played for laughs - it's hard to take the bit when Emil drives into the toxic waste seriously. A word of praise also for Phil Tippets wonderful stop motion ED - 209. In terms of being a movie with meaning, Robocop should probably be counted among Paul Verhoevens earlier Dutch work such as Soldier of Orange, rather than his later Hollywood offerings. Well worth a look if you only know him as the guy who directed Showgirls.

"This is one great American movie. It has your heroes and your villains. It's got some humor and it's packed full of graphic violence. This is a classic that nobody can deny. This movie rocks. The kind of movie that makes your ass wanna get up and cheer. Robocop, one hell of a movie." "I would have liked to have been in the room when Paul Verhoeven pitched Robocop: \"Ok, you've got this cyborg cop fighting crime in 'old' Detroit; setting: the not too distant future. There'll be political intrigue, bloody over-the-top action, commercials for invented products and very large explosions. But it is going to be funny...it's an action/comedy. Oh, and it will star Peter Weller from that BUCKAROO BANZAI flick...and Jose Ferrer's kid, what's-his-name...whatever. Gimme, gimme, gimme money so I can make this great and deranged film!\" How did ROBOCOP get made? Who cares...it is a great movie. I saw this when I was ten or eleven and thought it was the pinnacle of cinematic achievement. Was there a better film circa 1988? Not for me there wasn't. Since then, I've grown up...expanded my knowledge of film, and realized that perhaps ROBOCOP isn't quite the masterpiece that I had thought. It still stands the test of time, however, and remains wonderfully entertaining. Kurtwood Smith's villain stands out as one of the most slimy of the 80's (along with Alan Rickman in DIE HARD). The makeup effects, by Rob Bottin, remain far superior to the computer generated effects they blight films with now; Basil Poledouris' musical theme is one of the most \"hummable\" in recent memory. A shudder never fails to work its way up my spine at some of the most gruesome moments... Films like ROBOCOP, PREDATOR, GREMLINS, DIE HARD amongst others, shaped my life from fragile early childhood. This may explain why I was so screwed up: I rigged sqibbs on my G.I. Joe figures, I laughed at car accidents, and was well on my way to becoming completely de-sensitized to all violence. But what are you going to do right? ROBOCOP helped me through some painful moments during my life as well. Like when I saw Ronny Cox in 'Cop Rock'; I said \"that's Dick Jones, he runs OCP! He runs the cops!\" What the hell was he doing singing on TV?...\"What would ROBOCOP do in this situation?\" I would ask myself as I began hitting the television screen with a chair. And why didn't Kurtwood Smith get better roles than THE CRUSH? He was in ROBOCOP right?...he's a movie star! Why didn't anyone else think that Nancy Allen was sexy?... It took me awhile to realize that (while as good as ROBOCOP is) it is simply a high-concept B-flick that walks a fine satirical line. If Verhoeven would have missed one step along the way, ROBOCOP could have quickly become one of the worst films of all time. He pulls it off, however, and let's hope that his warped film will continue to corrupt the youth of America for years to come. Excuse me now, I have to punch out all the windows of my car. Thank You. 8/10" "A lot of ppl call this movie violent. No it isn't. That's just red jam coming out of everyone's wounds...argh, it's so simple. Anywho...this movie is so cool cuz the concept was awesome, the story moves well, the bad guys are really evil (read: kurtwood smith is gold EVERYWHERE, and ronny cox), and for an action film with lots of violence (violence for a reason), it had emotion and it's funny parts. Oh and as a kid the evil bot FREAKED me out. Crazy... Anywho, if you haven't watched this, then what you waiting for? Do it now!" "When I first saw \"Robocop\" during its 1987 theatrical run, I was seventeen years old and quite honestly had never seen a movie THAT violent in my entire life. Naturally, I loved it. The story was straight out of comic books (which are another passion of mine...and Robo DID eventually make it into comics a year or two after the first movie), and \"Robocop\" has a wicked sense of humor that elevates it past the normal mindless blow-em-up action picture. I enjoyed both sequels as well, but nothing beats the original. Fifteen years later it's kind of funny to see Kurtwood Smith, who played Robo's arch-nemesis Clarence Boddicker, playing \"Red\" on \"That 70's Show\", though. :) The eventual syndicated televison series toned down the mayhem of the films and is pretty much unwatchable unless you're hung over and there's nothing better on TV. Stick with the film series, starting here." "ive seen this movie hundreds of times and is still awesome!! the best cyborg bought on film ever. Peter Weller is excellent as Robo and the villains are great. check out the directors cut, even better!! 10/10" "Robocop is a great movie. A+, one of my favorites definate good movie to own , but better to own on DVD or DVD limited edition!! I'm hoping to get my hands on the limited edition (regular version, uncut). In fact it is the best robocop movie that there is. You can even check ratings. Do not see any other robocop's were horrible." "I can play \"Soldier of Fortune\", I can watch \"Day of the Dead\", but i just cannot stomach the violence in Robocop. It's horrible, it disturbs me beyond belief and is literally nauseating. The thing is about the violence is that it's exaggurated. For example, in this film, if someone cut their finger open, there'd be fountains and fountains of blood that would flood the room. As it happens, no one cuts their fingers. But arms are blown off, brains gush out of bullet riddled heads, and one man gets his guts blown open by a minigun. It's horrible! The most unwatchable film ever!" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "[CONTAINS SPOILERS] This movie is an all-time favorite of mine. I didn't like it when I first saw it, but I went back and watched it again later and loved it. This one, II and III are all favorites. I rented them at the video store so much I probably put the retailer's kids through college. The city of Detroit is currently in turmoil. A cop killer named Clarence Boddicker and his men are wreaking havoc on the city and killing cops this way and that; A giant corporation called OCP (Omni Consumer Products) owns half of it. It's run by The Old Man (Halloween III: Season of the Witch's Dan O'Herlihy) and his partner Dick Jones (Ron Cox). OCP is also in control of the local police department where a new cop, Murphy (Peter Weller who turned 55 2 days ago) was joining. He's partnered with Anne Lewis, an aggressive street cop. Meanwhile, a meeting is held at the OCP complex. They've decided human police officers are inefficient so they've build a giant automation called ED-209, programmed to stop crime dead in its tracks. Literally. A young executive volunteers to do a demonstration, but ED-209 backfires and frontfires at the poor man. (Gruesome!!!) All seems lost until an ambitious executive Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer) decides to make his own crime fighting machine. Only he must find a candidate to become the machine. Poor Murphy is killed by Clarence and his men so they turn him into the machine: RoboCop. He foils a liquor store robbery attempt and saves the mayor's life. Anne Lewis recognizes Murphy in all that armor. One by one, RoboCop arrests Clarence and his men. Only problem: they're on Dick Jones' payroll. He bails them out of jail and sics ED-209 on Robo. So he and Lewis hideout at a refinery. Clarence and his men go after him with hi-tech weaponry. Robo takes them all out then heads back to OCP to prove Dick Jones guilty. The day is saved, thanks to RoboCop (Murphy.) A brilliant movie, I must say. See it! I recommend it! (If you've got the uncut DVD, you'll see this movie the way it was meant to be seen. It's very gruesome and graphic, but if that's your cup of tea, it's your cup of tea). -" "Recently, I decided to reaquaint myself with an old friend, Paul Verhoeven's sci-fi classic: Robocop. It's brilliance still shines after all these years. Film critic Mark Kermode once said that what made The Exorcist brilliant, was the fact that it worked on so many levels. Robocop works on even more levels: as an action film, it more than delivers, as a social commentry, it gives us a stern warning about the direction we are going in, as a satire, it takes stinging stabs at the Regan era with the privitisation of the police etc. ''You have 20 seconds to comply.''" "Verhoeven has this apocalyptic vision I believe that inspires brilliance in many of his films. ROBOCOP is arguably the best of all of them, though TOTAL RECALL remains probably his most successful and arguably Schwarzewnegger's piece de resistence! Everything about ROBOCOP bears the mark of professionalism. Tight script, superb action sequences and outstanding fx. Peter Weller, unfairly categorised as a \"B\" List actor (mainly through lack of being offered better roles) is spot on here as Officer Murphy, sadistically tortured and shot whilst doing his duty (a graphically presented set-piece that doubtless incurred it's \"R\" certificate) whose few remaining functional parts are cannibalised in the re-construction of the bio-mechanical lawman ROBOCOP. Wanna tell me we couldn't use a guy like this now? Verhoeven pits intelligence against violence in a deft weave. The film is multi-layered and can be viewed on levels ranging from the mindless to the quizzical. Is there not a strong religious theme here after ROBOCOP himself is cruelly \"murdered\" and then resurrected? The film heightens both the inherent evils present in modern day living and the fact that still, decency and honor win out eventually? For all its violence, which its detractors still gleefully evince, ROBOCOP remains I consider, a socially responsible film. As action fare alone, it was not only one of the best on offer in the 80's (it kicked ass, like none before it) but it was years ahead of its time. Watching it today, it has aged but little. Do not even THINK of comparing it to the one-dimensional Verhoevenless sequel which was as bad as this was great!"

"Paul Verhoeven's Robocop is a most unusual type of film. It succeeds in being almost everything. On the surface, the film might just look like an action picture. And it's exactly that. Robocop is ungodly violent; just as it should be. Robocop is also a wicked satire, on everything from the media to big corporations. Like most Paul Verhoeven films, Robocop is brilliant. Violent and funny -- the perfect 80's movie." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Released in 1987, Robocop, the movie, stands as the ultimate symbolic testament to Christianity. Unlike other movies of the decade like The Breakfast Club, St. Elmo's Fire, or Sixteen Candles, Robocop was not afraid to be religious, entertaining and packed with butt kicking action. Like other movies depicting Christ figures (i.e. The Terminator, Aliens and Superman III), Robocop was extremely poignant omitting no details of the life and times of Jesus Christ. The movie begins by introducing Officer Alex Murphy, a streetwise cop with a soft side. He is gunned down by an affiliation of drug pushing psychopaths. I was immediately reminded of the Romans and how they gunned down Jesus in that seemingly abandoned warehouse. After Murphy is considered dead, an organization called OCP combines the biological flesh of his body with steel, circuitry and a fistful of attitude. This was exactly like the resurrection. As Jesus did rise, so did Alex Murphy. Sure, back in Biblical times, they could only really rebuild Jesus with wood and cement, so it might take a stretch of the imagination to fully see the connection. Murphy, in the form of Robocop, is sent out onto the mean streets of Detroit. As he guns down criminal after criminal in a savage manner, I was reminded of the way Christ shot up Roman oppressors like lambs bent for slaughter. The end of the movie is where it gets really good. The drug pushing psychopaths that attacked Murphy, a.k.a. Proto-Jesus, are cornered by Murphy. They try to stop him with a giant magnet, somewhat similar to the way Satan caught Jesus in a tiger trap. Robocop gets free and in a series of dizzying action sequences, he blows the leader of the drug pushers away, until there's not even enough left of him to smear like Jelly on toast. Then, Robocop ascends to the Heavens in order to wage war on Lucifer's armies. This opened up for Robocop 2: Cyber-Revelations. Some have told me that they missed the symbolism that showed Robocop as a Christ figure. I don't see how that's even possible. Not even Terminator 2 had this many references to Biblical scripture and that movie starred Arnold Schwarzenegger, the `GOD' of action cinema." "Robocop will always rank as a unique oddity within a genre that is constantly regurgitating itself. Paul Verhoeven created a masterpiece, a film which comments on the human condition and makes a statement about life and living. It's quite a head trip to watch this movie, not just for Robocop finding his roots but how the system that created him decides to play God with their reanimated creation. Verhoeven always manages to make a film which is typically entertaining to some degree, and Robocop is such a distinction. Peter Weller and Kurtwood Smith were excellent, and let's not forget about one the best sci-fi scores ever by Basil Poledoris!" "Made in 1987, this film paints a rather bleak picture of the future in it's depiction of the escalation of crime in a major metropolitan area (in this case, the city of Detroit), but what's really disconcerting watching it now is the fact that the reality of today seems to be catching up and closing in on this fictional future all too quickly. And it's a scary proposition when you think about it, which makes `Robocop,' an action/drama directed by Paul Verhoeven, something of a cautionary tale, as well as engrossing entertainment. Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is a veteran police officer, newly assigned to crime infested `Old Detroit,' which is about to undergo a major renovation. Plans are on the board for a multi-million dollar new city, but first the vermin who control the present city have to be eliminated. Toward that end, OCP, the major corporation apparently controlling just about everything (including the police department), are about to unveil a new kind of `policeman,' that will make the `Murphy's' of the force nothing more than support units. What they're proffering is an ominous looking robot, the `Ed-209,' touted by OCP Vice President Dick Jones (Ronny Cox) as the law enforcement of the future. An up-and-comer with OCP, Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer), has ideas of his own, however, that involve a project he's been trying to implement that would feature yet a different kind of `future cop.' And when a demonstration of Ed-209 goes awry, Morton makes his move, pitching his plan to `The Old Man' (Dan O'Herlihy), the CEO of OCP. Murphy, meanwhile, on his first day of duty in Old Detroit, is brutally gunned down and killed (or is he?) by a gang of criminals lead by one Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith). Bad for Murphy, good for Morton, however, who proceeds to turn Murphy into a prototype of his vision of the future of law enforcement. Enter `Robocop,' half human, all cyborg. Good for Detroit, bad for criminals, especially Boddicker and his gang. Because somewhere deep inside of what's left of Murphy, is a glimmer of memory. And Boddicker's face was the last thing he ever saw. Going into this project, Verhoeven definitely had a vision of what he wanted this film to be. That vision was dark and violent, and he succeeded in bringing it to fruition, in grand and graphic style. The finished product is extremely violent and at times unpleasant to watch; but it's also riveting filmmaking, and quite effective. it works because Verhoeven gives you more than just a gore-fest; despite the graphic violence (the scene in which Murphy is gunned down, for example, is beyond brutal), he keeps the human element at the heart of the story. He never lets you forget that beneath all that armor there is-- or was-- a man. And he gives you just enough background of Murphy's personal life to make you care about him, and it makes what happens to him all the more disturbing. On the other side of the coin, his villains are despicable, and you get to a point where you can't wait for Robocop to mete out the justice they so readily deserve. Verhoeven's presentation is solid and cohesive, perfectly complementing the action with the drama, which affords the audience a satisfying cinematic experience. And quite an experience it is. In a challenging role, Peter Weller succeeds in his portrayal of this man-turned-machine; in lesser hands, Robocop may have been nothing more than a machine with a bit of flesh beneath the metal, but Weller plays to the man inside, rather than the machine that encases him, and it makes a huge difference in the way the character is perceived. Weller's performance enables the audience to become emotionally involved with the `Murphy' he presents, rather than offering just a soulless `Robocop,' which from an action standpoint would have been fine, but would have diminished the drama and the overall impact of the film. Obviously, this is something Verhoeven and Weller realized, and in the final analysis, it was their collaboration and like-minded approach to the character that made this film really work. Another interesting aspect of this film is that there are three significant villains, each plying their own unique brand of treachery, and all effectively presented by the actors portraying them. Cox epitomizes the unscrupulous corporate executive, who cares less about the service or product he can provide than the `bottom line,' while Ferrer's Morton is an insufferable snake. The worst of the bunch, however, is Smith's Boddicker, the kind of villain you love to hate, but who is also unsettling upon reflection, as his outward appearance so subtly masks what a truly evil individual he is. You hate to think that there are really people like this walking around free in the world. Also turning in memorable performances are Nancy Allen, as Murphy's partner, Anne Lewis; Ray Wise, as Leon Nash, one of Boddicker's bunch; and Paul McCrane, as Emil, another of Boddicker's men (McCrane is especially good at creating characters you despise, as he does with his portrayal here, and currently as Dr. Romano is TV's `ER'). The supporting cast includes Robert DoQui (Sergeant Reed), Felton Perry (Johnson), Jesse D. Goins (Joe), Del Zamora (Kaplan), Calvin Jung (Minh), Rick Lieberman (Walker), Lee de Broux (Sal), Mark Carlton (Miller) and Edward Edwards (Manson). Hard-edged, thought-provoking, visceral entertainment, `Robocop' is a film you may have to steel yourself a bit for, but it's well made and delivered, and ultimately, a mesmerizing cinematic experience that far exceeds the typical action genre formula. It's violent, but then again, so is real life; and this is one of Life's stories." "I went to this movie with skepticism, and left loving it. Fictitious, but with realism in the what if extent of the possibility of this happening. This is a good film about the victim finding out the question of Who am I. When the guy gets fired, you will understand how that goes with the prime directive. The commercials, and news stories create humor, and realism at the same time. I love the dark humor, they use the dad from \"That 70's show\" as a heel, with a lot of humor when he does a hit, where they play a video cd. The end is great, and the film goes full circle, but you got to laugh at what happens to the Ed 90, and I love those Cobra Assault guns. Rent this if you love Sci-fi. 10/10" "Forget Dirty Dancing and all those other so called 'feel good' films. This is what cheers people up, seeing scummy little criminals beaten to a pulp by an indestructible being. The only shame is that it was make believe & they weren't real muggers, robbers & thieves. We could do with some real 'robocops' at the moment. We don't really need any other films in this genre though as this has really said all there is, but it's always worth a look. 8/10" "This classic near-future sci-fi works both as the ultra-violent effects-laden action flick and the cynical critisism of the corruption that permeates our modern world. It is full of memorable one-liners and over the top shocker scenes. Violence is abundant but never pointless or glorified. The movie is by far not without flaws... for example, what about the scene when he consults the database in the police station? Aren't they seeing what kind of truth he has discovered and wouldn't they somehow prevent him from going out and \"doing his job\"? But the good thing is that things like these don't really matter. The film just keeps rolling and your thoughts don't linger on the flaws. This is one of the rare films that you tend to enjoy not as much for its substance but rather its style and for a couple of scenes that can be re-watched without ever getting boring BUT at the same time does score some rather strong points in terms of message, ability to provoke thought and overall intelligence. 8/10" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Warning: Possible Spoilers I loved this movie. It was dark, and yes it was violent, but is was very cool. The mixture of comedy (for example, the continuous stream of T.V. ads for stuff such as a board game called \"Nuke Em!\") and drama (I found the scene where RoboCop discovers the fate of his wife and child strangely moving) works really well. When I first saw it, I wasn't expecting it to be so much of a satire, but it was this that leant the movie its edge. Performances were okay. Weller did as much of a good job as he could within the suit, and Allen was likeable as his sidekick. Kurtwood Smith and Ronny Cox were sufficiently evil as the bad guys, making the film greatly entertaining. Plus, how could you not love a movie which contains everyone's favourite \"melting man being run over\" scene. 9 out of 10." "This movie is one of the best movies of all time. The special effects, the musical score, everything about it is great. I've seen this movie over and over and it never gets boring. Peter Weller is excellent playing the famous Robocop. To put in simple words what I think about the movie: Robocop rules!" "Robocop,Paul Verhoeven's Sci-fi action yarn is the best film I have ever seen.It is intelligent with its political and American social issues and Director Paul Verhoeven does more than deliver the overblown and ultra stylish action set pieces(the melting man,the warehouse shootout). It also delivers on the violent side, most memorable of course is the death of Murphy as he executed in the same way as Jesus. The trashy news flashes bring out the comedy in the film,and the death of Murphy pulls the tragic side of the drama into it.The film moves at a rollicking pace,is never taken too seriously and leads you all the way through to the truly thrilling climax. A matchless masterpiece, and a film that you have to see to believe!"

"*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS It may have been produced purely to capitalize on the success of that other eighties cyborg cult-hit The Terminator, but Robocop still manages to not only thrill, but also entertain. I use the word still, but to be honest, I only saw the film really for the first time today (I got the Director's cut DVD today for my birthday), so I have no idea what people though of it when it first came out, I know it must have been big business as it necessitated two crap sequels and two TV spin offs (one animated, one live action). I also remember the kids at my high school talking about it every time it was show on television the night before, I was once lucky enough to see one of those screenings, but sadly for me, it was edited for TV. Which made watching Verhoeven's gore splattered director's cut toady a real eye opening experience. Where as in the TV version, say for example Murphy's (Peter Weller) death scene, we saw some guns go off, heard a couple of comedic one-liners, then wee saw a body hit the floor. So, for the rest of the film, we had no idea what kind of agony Murphy went through, so therefore, we are unable to feel enough of a connection with him to get more out of the film. But seeing the character of Murphy destroyed by shotgun blast in the un-cut version, his limbs torn from his body, the laughs and now menacing one-liners, only made Robocop's struggle all the more moving as the film reached it's third act. That's always been my problem with the censor board, they are all to willing to have guns, being fired and people being killed, but we're not allowed to see the actual effect that a gun can do to a human body. So we get films like the Matrix, in which fifty people are killed (by the hero I might add) being deemed suitable for young teenagers, and that's fine, as long as we don't see the consequences of a violent act. Then, conversely we can have a film like Natural Born Killers, which was held back from distribution and brought-up all kinds of political debates, as to whether or not the film was dangerous, all because Oliver Stone was brave enough to show the effect that violent crimes have on people, maybe if he didn't do the greatest job with said material, he was still persecuted for a film in which, although about killers, had less people killed than in the Matrix. And this is a problem that has followed Verhoeven throughout his career. Admittedly, sometimes the violence in his films can be exploitative, like for example Star-ship Troopers, but in Robocop the violence is completely justified, as it's from that unforgiving violent act that the story is developed. Judging from Robocop, they should really let euro art-house directors make Hollywood blockbusters more often. Paul Verhoeven, then better know for his Dutch art films Turkish Delight, Soldier of Orange and The 4th Man, not only heightens the dramatic impact of the characters, but also the harsh social critique directed at America. The film not only looks at the problems with capitalization if big business, the privatisation of the police force, and the growing consciousness of the mass media, it also has a strong message about the triumph of the soul. How many blockbusters would even attempt to pick-up on any of those issues, few I can think of. A truly underrated film from the eighties cycle of violent action. 8/10" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "I loved this movie. The violence is good in this movie. The bad guys are hatable in it. Dick Jones was an excellent bad guy. So was Clarence Bodicker. There won't be many more villains like them. MINOR SPOILER - directive 4 was a brilliant idea for this movie.END OF SPOILER. The Old Man that owns OCP in this one is cool. This one is lots of FUN. The action , violence , ideas, and acting all make this movie legendary. Alot of the scenes happen at night which I thought was cool. This movie has one of the best endings ever to it. Bob Morton the guy that designs Robocop is likeable too. This is a good move with a good plot good violence and good characters." "RoboCop is one of the greatest movies ever made and it is also my favorite movie. It has a great story about a man who was killed on the line of duty and resurrected as a crime fighting cyborg. Yes this movie has a lot of violence but I think it is relevant because it matches the story and it also shows how bad the world can get. Also this movie is about slavery. Murphy was robbed of his right to die. He has become a slave of the world because of his directives to serve the public trust, protect the innocent, and to uphold the law. As a cop he had the choice to bend the rules to get things right. But since these rules are now programmed into him, he has to follow them to the letter. Even if he wanted to save someone and it meant bending the rules to 'uphold the law' he could not. Worse yet, there was a fourth directive to never oppose an OCP officer. OCP was the bad guy but he could not do anything about it. If he was fully human then maybe he could. A great movie with a great story. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes Sci-fi. I also recommend RoboCop: Prime Directives which was a great mini-series. Anyway, I think this movie is the greatest Sci-fi movie ever!" "Detriot cop peter weller is transformed in to unstopable crime fighting machine,after being guned down by a gang of violent thug's. Then goes out to get revenge. Savage sc-fi action with some nicely satirical moment's on the behalf of big corporation's. Started conterversal dutch director paul verhoeven's hollywood career. Sc-fi fan's will love it but some may be replused by it's graphic violence. five stars out of five" "Paul Verhoeven's ambitious action masterpiece was a huge success at the time of its release in 1987, but I tend to think that it would not be nearly a successful if a film like it had been released today. Action and science fiction movies have come a long way since the 80's, and it's also no secret that the success of Robocop owes a huge amount to it's far superior predecessor, The Terminator, but Robocop is also very much able to stand on its own. The first Teminator film, released in 1984, is undeniably the film that really launched interest in the whole man vs. machine/cyborg theme, Robocop came along a few years later and renewed that interest, then we had a pathetic installment called Cyborg from Van Damme in 1989, a couple of mediocre Robocop sequels, and of course, the stunningly successful and well-made Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Robocop is separated from The Terminator most significantly in that the entire movie takes place in the future and there is not time travel (other than that) involved. The conflict here is not necessarily between man and machine, but between man and man where machine is used as a weapon between the two. It is definitely a more basic version of the almost universal good vs. evil story structure, with man on either end of the story in this case and each with their own superhuman robot to fight the other with. The story is thankfully complicated by the involvement of a gang of tremendously hardcore criminals who work for the bad guys at OCP but are not necessarily controlled by them, which leaves open a lot of possibilities in the plot and prevents it from being entirely predictable. Robocop is definitely among the most violent non-Scorsese films out there, almost to the point of being nauseating. This is definitely not something to show to the kids (although my parents allowed me to watch it over and over when I was a kid myself  I don't know how I could stand it), but it's good for something to watch when you're in the mood for what seems to be a really bad action movie that somehow managed to succeed. The movie is well written and well-acted (although some of the criminals in the film were exaggerated to the point of amusement), and has some startlingly realistic special effects, especially the shootings (although I've never actually seen anyone get shot before, so I can only assume that that's what it looks like). Robocop is almost like a cult classic, because someone who watches it now for the first time is not likely to enjoy it very much although original fans are likely to defend the film to no end, but it is definitely among the best of director Paul Verhoeven's U.S. films, which include mediocre productions like Showgirls and Hollow Man. This movie is undoubtedly more violent than most people are likely to enjoy, but if there is a place in modern cinema for gratuitous violence(and I tend to think that there is) then it is in movies like Robocop. It is a movie that was never meant to win any Academy Awards, and it earns respect by not pretending that it is." "Paul Verhoeven's sophomore effort and still his best.Set in Detroit, the near future, we see that crime is rampant. In comes OCP, a giant corporation the likes that will exist in the States within ten years (a merger between, say, General Electric, Exxon and Microsoft) to deliver a new weapon against crime. Their first project failed due to a slight mishap, poor Mr. Kinney. That weapon is Robocop, part man - namely former cop Murphy who stood in the way of a barrage of gunfire and did not live to tell about it- and part machine. Only, Murphy's brain wasn't completely erased and soon he's out on the town to find Boddicker, the man that did this to him. Turns out that Boddicker is teaming up with OCP's own Vice-President to stop Robo in his tracks. So what makes this one so interesting. Satire as always, on American life, consumerism, big business, the media, violence, lots of violence and in the middle a Christlike parable. See Robo walk on water in his final confrontation with Boddicker! The commercials - Nuke'Em, the family game-, the bits of TV-news -the new SDI-space center misfired, killing four former Presidents- and the inner workings between the OCP exec's are all meant to poke fun at American society, a society that can use a bit of critique every once in a while (well, maybe not this week). But beware, this movie oozes with gore, the scene where badguy nr. 6 drives his van in a big vat of chemical waste comes to mind, and violence. Alternatively, if you're into that sort of thing, the DVD has got the uncut version, filled with even more bits of mayhem. Don't bother with the sequel; it tried to emulate but never came close." "Ultraviolence at its best! RoboCop is one of the most violent movies I have ever seen, but this doesn't make it bad at all. Paul Verhoeven exaggerates with violence into a whole new level in cinematic history, and has thereby created a great atmosphere, which makes it a great movie. The story is fairly good (good guys vs. bad guys), ok for a sci-fi action-movie. The acting was good and I especially liked Kurtwood Smith (Clarence) as the arch villain, somehow his parts in movies always end up being a bad guy and he's outstanding in that specific job! In overall it holds a great entertaining-value and is a movie you can watch over and over again! 8 out of 10" "Let's set the record straight, RoboCop isn't Terminator and Paul Verhoeven isn't James Cameron. However, these two are very similar in their styles and this is proof. The mixing of crude or vulgar humor with gory (what some may consider excessive) violence is wonderful. You can't help but laugh when the store thief, rapist, or ultra-cool ED-209 get theirs in particularly funny was. Granted the seriousness and decay of Detroit causes more serious deaths (Clarence, Joey, Bob Morton, misc. police) the corporate cruelty befalling the city by the underworld only reinforces the fact that our society is becoming more and more like this one. Beware the enforcement droids!" "Simply a brilliantly made film, which seems humorous considering the subject matter. Verhoeven manages to create an atmosphere that hasn't really been touched since. The ultra-violence mixes superbly with the dark comedy to create the just-slightly-in-the-future Detroit setting. Then, to top it all off we get a great Christ parable as well. Murphy is killed and then resurrected in order to clean up the system. Keep your eyes peeled near the end so you don't miss the walking on water scene. They actually built boards under the water for Peter Weller to walk on so don't think it's just shallow water, that's on purpose. Basically, if you can handle the violence and you're prepared for the tongue in cheek attitude of the movie, you've got to love it. Just don't watch Robocop 3 whatever you do." "When this film first came out I went with my father to see it. We were on an extroadinarily long line, my first \"blockbuster\" film experience that I could remember (I can barely remember waiting for E.T. my only other previous experience with such a high scale film). Needless to say, when the ED-209 scene came on, I was flipping my shihtzu (heh), and we had to walk into Revenge Of The Nerds II instead. Crica: 1989, I rented Robocop, trying to understand the extreme emotions from only a few years previous. I like to think that a movie capable of extracting such extreme emotions as it did me, from an individual is worth checking out. This movie ended up becoming one of my favorite Sci-Fi films of all time. I love Paul Verhoven, he is such a visionary director. A lot of people seem to end up asking the \"how\"s and \"why\"s of his material, which is more often than not a personally motivated statement, usually personal vision of social commentary. This film works on both levels of social commentary in an extreme ideal that it could be interpreted to people who cannot look into the surreal elements of our culture and society everyday. You have to admit, it is quite surreal, and thus- in cinema, people expect reality times ten. A sort of reality on steroids, even in fantasy pieces. Verhoven delivers in this respect, but at points going over the heads of some of the more action-film prone audience who end up criticising rather than interpreting. Robocop's place in Sci-Fi history is somewhat skewed by its sketchy sequels, but I never judge a film by its followups. Never forget who or why, and the term \"how\" could be very well a recurrent theme in the fact of comparison to the fact that only a small handful of films in the following 14 years lives up to the quality of this films resolve."

"Robocop is one of those movies that kids weren't allowed to see but wanted to and did anyways. In Detroit a cop is killed by a drug lord and is brought back by a greedy company as a cyborg programmed to fight crime. The sleaze that killed Murphy has an devilishly programmed robot built by the same company pose a threat to him. The guy who plays the villain was very good and freaked me out as a kid. It's weird to see him on that 70's show. Peter Weller does a decent job as robocop and Murphy. Some of the movie doesnt hold up wiht time but the effects and violent action still hold up. The scene that always freaked me out was when the red head dude is hideously mutatedby toxic waste. Cool for action/adventure and sci fi fans.***" "I bought this movie on the DVD Criterion Collection, and I feel I am qualified to make the following statement. Paul Verhoeven should not make any more movies. This guy has made a lot movies that should not have been made. He made Showgirls and Basic Instinct, which how they got an R and not a NC-17 I will never know. He made The Hollow Man, which was nice eye candy. As was Starship Troopers and Total Recall. But all his (American) movies has one thing in common, I feel really dirty and guilty after sitting through them. Verhoeven is a technically masterful director. He works with accomplished actors and actresses with long distinguished careers, with the exception of Showgirls of course, but they are just dirty films. RoboCop is a great example of this. A science fiction movie with Kurtwood Smith and Peter Weller should be golden. It should be something that you would watch with your friends on a movie marathon night right between Terminator and Aliens. And while this movie is one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever, it really doesn't fit in with any other movie, you know except for Total Recall. Rating 8 but with reservations." "As a child of the 80's I would just like to say that this was the last great sci-film of that decade. Sci-fi just doesn't have the same meaning anymore. It's all effects driven nowadays, and that's not too tempting considering the fact that most cgi is so poorly done! But robocop didn't rely completely on ground-breaking visuals, instead there was a story to stand strong on. Filmmakers should one day take a break from their coke-snorting lives and take notes on this movie...it'd really help. And if I half to witness one more sci-fi abomination, THAT'LL BE THE LAST STRAW, I'll bloody switch to romantic comedies!!! Urgh!" "Don't let the comic book approach fool you. This story in primarily a drama, and a very human one at that. Murphy is a man, a human being, with a life, a love, a family, etc. All that is taken away from him, but not so much by the criminals with the shotguns like most people think. They were very cruel in 'dismantling' Murphy piece by piece, but at all times they were shooting at a PERSON. It was OCP's execs that finished the job in trying to remove his humanity from him. It was they that took the arm he had left, took his memories, took the things that we all take for granted. It was they that tried to remove the humanity from the man. But they failed. Murphy's humanity showed through at all times, though thinly at first. Just the twirling gun, the favorite catch phrase, just the little things we usually don't even think about. As his memories almost returned in the form of dreams his humanity responded next with a cry for vengeance. He sought out his killers, not realizing who the real killers were. When he DID find out who was really behind his death, it only led to him being brought down in a hail of gunfire again, this time at the hands of the police. Again his outside forces were trying to strip away his humanity, but this time it backfired. The human that had relearned courage and duty was now forced to relearn fear. Thus humanity was strengthened on one of our greatest failings. He survived the ordeal the second time, and it was then that he confessed his humanity to Nancy Allen's character. He could feel the loss of his family, but couldn't remember their names. After this he had to face his killers again. Boddicker and his gang? They hated him. They feared him. They wanted to kill him. Him. Not It. They were still shooting at a person, not a thing. At the end Murphy was robbed of the chance to overcome his programming and arrest Dick Jones, but it didn't matter by that point. The CEO (as played by Dan O'Herlihy) asked for his name, he gave it. Murphy. Not Robocop. His program still limited him much like the written laws might limit the spirit of what our police officers are trying to do while protecting us, but Murphy was a HIM now, never again to be an IT. All the jokes, the cartoonish violence, even that \"I'll buy that for a Dollar!\" guy couldn't distract from the sheer victory for humanity announced in that one simple two syllable word, Murphy." "Half man, half machine and he's a cop. What great subject matter for a gritty not-so-distant \"future\" movie. So my question is why did this concept take so long to be realized? It's an entertaining movie on different levels, but more so, it presents a very dark, sad, but true portrait of urban America as it is becoming. Crime is steadily increasing and law enforcement are understaffed, under budgeted, outnumbered and out gunned and it doesn't appear like it's going to be changing anytime soon. Welcome to New Detroit. The story of Murphy (Peter Weller) losing his own human live to only be turned around and made into a mecha savior for the masses is a topic all it's own. Sure the primary story arch is as gratifying as it is easy to follow - there's a conspiracy of some grand level going on as there always is and its very easy to spot the bad guys, who are clear and clear bad, but no matter on how many levels this movie engages you - it works brilliantly in the face of it's own simplicity noticeably because of these layers. I could drown on about it some more, but you really need to see the movie for yourself. Paul Verhoven who's known to do some pretty controversial and high profile material emerges from this movie with an instant classic. The story works its weaves, the cast is good, the black humor and tone throughout is strong, the action done proper and the whole thing stands up well faced with genre peers. If only the Verhoven-less sequels could have kept the train from leaving the track." "I watch this several time and I never got bored. Despite of so called \"cartoon\" feel, it didn't really bother me (The similar formula used later in Starship Troopers) The story is pretty good and it mixed with irony, satire, humor and melodrama. 8 out of 10" "From the year 1970 to 2000 there were more people killed at crime scenes in the United States than all the wars the nation has ever indulged in from the year of its inception in 1776. The media loves crime and war, so the media tells us as it constantly searches for advertisers and consumers. Thus, this film, a \"kill-for-fun\" genre product, in keeping with Earth culture, is still engrossing and has a merciful strain of humanity running through it despite its body bag count. Perhaps this is more of a nod to the inside core of its market than any contact with compassion. If Mary Godwyn Shelley was alive in 1987, the year Robocop was released, instead of 1817, the year her novel, Frankenstein, was published; this film might have amused her. It lifts its best elements from her immortal book." "Everything in this movie works perfectly! A good story, a blazing pace, a sense of humor, good performances, lots of action, and one of the best scores ever make this one of my all time favorite movies. Peter Weller's performance is great and Kurtwood Smith is one of the best villains ever! This was Paul Verhoeven's first and best American Movie. Made for only 13 million, it offers more bang for your buck than countless other huge budgeted movies. Watch it and see what I mean. The two sequels are alright, but can't even compare to this one. Many people want a fourth Robocop to be made, but why? They should have only made one in the first place! Either that or handled the sequels better. A true action classic that works on many other levels." "Robocop is a very violent movie, which is not for the fainthearted, but it's done so in a Troma film-like way. A Detroit cop is nearly killed in the line of duty and brought back on foot by cyborg-like technology. When he gets his original memory back he vows revenge on the sadistic psychopaths that shot him (Kurtwood Smith, who wastes his talent on \"That 70s Show\" played one mean bad guy here.) The plot is meat and potatoes but it becomes more of a satire on the corruption and imperialistic ways of capitalism. Total Recall, which was directed three years later by Paul Verhoeven, has that same kind of satire. A classic film, and if you have an action movie collection, this movie should be in it." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "My first comment posted on imdb was for RoboCop, but all it said was to avoid \"RoboCop 2.\" Looking back, that seemed like a pretty lame way to comment on \"RoboCop,\" my favorite movie of all time. I hereby present the following, more relevant review: \"How can your favorite movie be RoboCop?\" I get that question a lot now, it seems. I'm not sure I want to write some kind of terribly detailed explanation of why this is my favorite movie of all time. Quite simply, everything in the movie works for me. To therefore try to explain what I like about the movie would equate to me writing about why a joke is funny when someone didn't get it. However, I'll give an effort here. I'll go ahead and state two main reasons on why I like the movie that most other fans of the movie probably didn't already state, such as the notion that it is a great satire of the corporatization of America, that it is ultra-violent and therefore cool, or that it works great as a bleak near-future sci-fi comedy. I didn't really dwell on those things when I saw this movie the first few times. So what did I like about it? SPOILER ALERT First of all, it is an extreme movie, but unlike many movies the extremeness works in this case. I felt the lowest point of disgust, the most uncomfortable fear, the highest thrills of triumph, moments of sadness, and moments of hilarity. The execution of Alex Murphy is one of the most horrifying things I had ever seen. I felt sooooo bad because of what happened, but this was brilliant on the part of the filmmakers because it made RoboCop that much more fun to root for, and it made his revenge that much sweeter. RoboCop then exists to counter all the woes we can experience. One very scary scene to me is the one where Emil threatens the college boy at the gas station (for anyone who's ever been behind the counter in a store, this scenario is dreadful!). It's even scarier than the scene where the armed robber holds up the mom and pop store, because in the other scene you know what Emil is capable of. Anyway, in both cases, out comes RoboCop to put the fear back in to the criminal. Elsewhere, RoboCop experiences deep loss because he has lost his past life, and for him to slowly realize that was very sad to me; he slowly finds out that he has lost his life and has been turned into a programmed robot. The scene where he revisits his house really made me sad; no one else gets a chance to come back from the dead and see what has happened since he had died and what he has lost because of it, and no one ever should. Therefore it's another joy to watch him triumph beyond that as well, as he starts to regain some semblance of free will and identity (and, thus, end the movie on a high note when he answers the question of \"What's your name?\" with a self-assured \"Murphy.\"). Add to that the satirical humor littered throughout the movie (the corporate cutthroats, the stupid \"I'd buy that for a dollar!\" guy, the news briefs), and it's got all the ingredients to touch every emotion: anger, pity, elation, laughter. Second of all, to put it quite simply: RoboCop is just plain cool! I loved comic book-style heroes, but to me RoboCop was the ultimate comic book hero. He's a cyborg, and he doesn't look cheesy, he looks slick (having become a fan of Transformers and RoboTech, a cyborg could easily get on my good side). He's got a huge gun that he can holster in his leg. He has great comic hero lines (\"Your move, creep!\" \"Dead or alive, you're coming with me.\" \"Come quietly or there will be... trouble.\"). And best of all, he's practically invulnerable! Poor helpless Murphy gets wasted by one of the most evil gangs of villains you've ever seen; they toy with him and laugh at his slaying. Then he comes back and they can't touch him. In the cocaine factory, he takes them all out, one shot at a time. He throws Clarence Boddicker (to me, the most evil slimeball villain ever; hats off to Kurtwood Smith!) through several windows and barely holds back from strangling him... with ease. The bad guys can't stop him, and in the final showdown, they come somewhat close, but you always know that they don't really have a chance. And these bad guys get it but good in the end. Of course, the worst is Emil's toxic waste death. How many murderers would you like to see get taken out like that? Anyhow, I loved RoboCop as a comic hero and a movie hero. Because you know what happened to him, you root for him all the way, from the moment he is being built to his final showdowns with Clarence and Dick Jones. So many other things are cool in the movie: how RoboCop takes out the rapist, the stop-motion ED-209, the little goofy commercials, the supporting cast which includes Murphy's partner Lewis, Sgt. Reed, RoboCop creator Bob Morton (go Miguel Ferrer, another actor whose specialty is slimeballs!). This is a spectacular entry into sci-fi, and was every much as big in the '80's as other sci-fi greats like Aliens, Terminator, and Predator. But in those movies, the good guys were always disadvantaged. Not so with RoboCop. \"Go Robo!\"" "Add another review" "Find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your Watchlist and rate your favorite movies and TV shows on your phone or tablet!")("Movies, TV & Showtimes" "Celebs, Events & Photos" "News & Community" "Watchlist" "" "Find industry contacts & talent representation" "Manage your photos, credits, & more" "Showcase yourself on IMDb & Amazon" "Sign in with Facebook Other Sign in options" "Own the rights?" "I loved this film ever since I first saw it back in the 80s, but it has so many levels that you notice when you go back and watch it time and time again. A future where Corporations run America is nothing new in films, but where Robocop differs is the fact its very believable. What this movie does is to take privatization one step further by showing a future where the police force of Detroit being privatized by the mega corporation OCP. Its over the top violence shows us just how fragile and meaningless human life can be, in a future where anyone can die in a second and no one is safe. At the same time, although violent it has an almost humorous undertone to the whole thing. Its media-break segments break up the film nicely, and provide the extra narrative to push the story along, without wasting time on needless dialogue which would have only bogged the film down. Our hero Alex Murphy played by Peter Weller doesn't have as much to do in the second half of the movie for obvious reasons, but brings very human qualities to Robo. While Kurtwood Smith is excellent as uber-villain gang boss of old detroit. Anyone who has seen this movie should go and buy the directors cut dvd, which adds more violent scenes which were cut out to avoid NC-17 rating only adds to the film greatly. The Commentary track on the dvd also provides huge insight into the film and story giving so many more opinions which would never have come from just straight watching the film. This is an all time great movie, and should belong on any serious film collectors shelf. Paul Verhoeven once said the thing he regrets most in his career is not taking directing duties on Robocop 2, and it shows as this is a far superior film. The Sequels get more inferior as they go on, and the series is so bad its not even worth the film it was printed on. Ed Neumeier, Jon Davison and Paul Verhoeven work so well as a team as they repeated in the also excellent Starship Troopers, but this, their first film is by far the best, go out and watch it again now!" "I saw this movie recently and I have to say, this movie ROCKED. The uniquely written storyline was excellent, the special effects great, and Peter Weller's portrayal as RoboCop\\Alex Murphy was great. Also, I was blown away by the relentless use of the \"f-word\" and the extreme violence present in the film. Let's face it: Paul Verhoeven created a masterpiece of entertainment." "POW!!!!!! IT'S ROBOCOP!!!..yes the best robo in the world...I Remember,sure i remember...it was 1988 and i saw this movie..LOL...what violence...clarence botker ís a cool bad guy and the scene who botker BLOWS up the heard of murphy's is very cool...Yes this is A CLASSIC CLASSIC,and for the people who don't want to get the PREMIUN VERSION(ALL SCENES,NO CUT) Don't be stuped...it's the best version....R(RATED) KICKED ASS...get the full version [*** / ***] ROBOCOP UP'S!" "Not only is this a brilliant film but it also has the most fantastic music score any film could wish for. Paul Weller plays his part magnificently. There is plenty of violence but not in a gruesome way. Well worth watching if you haven't seen it before. Watch it with the volume RIGHT UP!" "I really love this film. First of all, it has an interesting plot. It's about a police officer who had been shot to death and bring back to life by OCP company. Really interesting. Next, it has a good action scenes. The scene I like best is that Robocop striked the drug lab and when he fought with ED-209. Full of gun firing and explosion. If you like sci-fi movie, it's a MUST-SEE for you." "Robocop cannot be praised enough as it is one of the most original action movies I have ever seen. The film blends violence with humor, something with not all movies can do well. I cannot believe this film was made in 1987 as it still packs a punch. For any fans of Robocop you must purchase the criterion DVD as this is the definitive Robocop and contains the most graphic scenes which were removed to get get an R rating, otherwise it would have got an X. Makes you wonder how violent a film can be to achieve and X rating only for its violence, well believe me when I say this version is very gory. An excellent film." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Why am I writing about RoboCop (1987) in the year 2000? Who will ever read these comments? I just purchased RoboCop on DVD from the Criterion Collection and it still works now as it did then. This is an ultra-violent film in many ways, and then there is humor and hope and justice in it as well. I remember the first time I saw the film. When Murphy gets gunned down by the gang, I was so full of rage it was hard to contain myself. I even felt bad when the young VP gets blown up by Clarence. The character of Clarence Boddiker (sp?) was so truly despicable that I still refer to the actor as \"Clarence\" whenever I see him (e.g. \"That 70's Show\" on Fox) and I shudder. I remember saying, kind of out loud, \"You're fired,\" just moments before it was said in the film. The way the film meted out justice, with its poignant moments and powerful ending, made all of the previous over the top violence tolerable in a way that cannot be said for over-hyped gore fests such as \"Natural Born Killers\" (not to compare the two films, they're vastly different -- but, I'm not a fan of ultra violent flicks. I'll never watch NBK again, because it is so violent and there is no pay back, whereas the bad people in RoboCop definitely get what they deserve. I'm not going to say much about the film here because I think it has so many good points, I could write an extensive essay on it. I give it a 10 out of 10 with the acknowledgment that it cannot be for everyone. I watching the film commentary, I will say that the speakers (director, producer and writer) make mention of something about how this film works as a Sci-Fi movie, which is similar to a comment I made about the recent \"X-Men.\" They say that this film, while in the not too distant future, does not have a lot of surreal or futuristic aspects to it. Basically, they have the robot (ED-209), and RoboCop, and that's about it. It works, because the world they present is not so different from our own. I made the same observation about \"X-Men\" saying that, yes, you have mutants, you have Xavier's school and Magneto's hideaway, then everything else is pretty much as it is in the current world. For both of these films, I thought it strengthened their believability over the comic book world of \"Batman.\" I don't think this is the most powerful observation one can make on this film, but I mention it because it did strike a chord with me as an aspect that can make a film work for a lot of people. If you present it as completely Sci-Fi, or comic book, you shut off a lot of potential audience because there are a lot of people who just aren't going to buy into these alternate worlds. To sum up, if you like RoboCop, watch it again, anytime, and you'll see that you still enjoy it. If you haven't seen it, give it a try, but know that it is violent. If you have a chance to see the Criterion version, check it out and enjoy the extras!" "I think it is superb, verhoven is my favourite director. There is nothing in this movie that I would like to change accept maybe some of the props. I must have seen it about 100 times! It is way ahead of any other movie at the time, has loads of cool one liners effects and story." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "When you hear the title, \"Robocop,\" you instantly think of the countless lame, boring comic-book style films that have been made. However, this is not the case with Paul Verhoeven's breakthrough American film. This is a Frankenstein story set in a crime-ridden world where corporations are buying everyone's future. To say that this movie is ultraviolent is an understatement, but it is greatly out-weighed by the satire. It has references to literature, Vietnam, and the corporate world all wrapped into one spectacular movie. One Murphy is killed by the sadistic drug dealers, you hate them because of their cruelty and brutality; but as the film progresses, you get to know them better, and I actually found them to be pretty funny. That's not to say that I didn't cheer when Robocop blew them away, but you get to realize that they have personality. It's the character development like this that is just one of the many key elements of this film. This is a must-see for all movie go-ers. However, stay away from the sequels; they turned Robocop into what is was never supposed to be; a lame, boring comic book story." "I first saw this movie back in 1989 in south Spain, My view it's the best sci-fi action movie of the late eighties. It has all the settings of a good sci-fi movie, dark futuristic atmosphere, violence, great action scenes, good synth music, harsh gritty language, great climaxes and atmospheric unforgettable scenes, and not to mention great special effects, including the gore scenes. It was followed by two extremely bad sequels. The old coin-up arcade game, was also great fun! They dont make them like this anymore 8/10 points!"

"Next to Terminator, Robocop is the best \"indestructible robot\" live action movie. This movie is never dull, which is what you might expect from a movie like this. The good thing about this movie is instead of showing Robo killing people for an hour, you see how he comes to be, and still has some human qualities. The robot suddenly remembers having a wife and kid, and is curious to learn more. There are good action sequences, which shows how Robocop processes and reacts(like his targeting systems, modes, even the dreaded violations, which results in shutdowns). But by the end of the movie, the \"machine\" is more human than ever, knowing what not to do, and naming itself after the officer who \"it\" once was. Think about it, good movies is where you find this." "I have the Directors cut of Robocop at home. It has SO much blood!! I actually laughed when Ed-2O9 shot that OCP guy because there was so much blood that it was ridiculous! Man, dont let your little kids see the Directors cut. Other than the extra scenes the DVD had, the movie and plot is still classic. I didnt feel sorry for the bad guys (the ones that killed Alex Murphy) Robocop killed no matter how brutally he was doing it. They got what the deserved. Great movie! Part 2 was really good too, but stay away from 3." "Robocop is the story of a man whose identity is stolen. Although hysterical at times, and intentionally asks you to suspend reality, the plot is as deep as you want it to be. Simple good guy, bad guy movie....... or a story of how the establishment denigrates the value of the individual in order to meet its greater need. Easy to watch, lots of guys to like or hate, Murphys struggle to regain his \"self\" is there all along. More than meets the eye........as Emil says,\"I like it!\"" "RoboCop is perhaps my favorite of all movies. It's a dark, and darkly humorous, modern sci-fi classic, much deeper in pathos and drama than a film with a comic book name like \"RoboCop\" would lead you to believe. The bad guys are over the top and the hero is worth rooting for. The main thing I just wanted to say is: Don't listen to the \"recommendation\" to see RoboCop 2!!! Done by a totally director and group of writers, it doesn't have the soul-driven touch of Paul Verhoeven, nor the wry humor of the Miner and Neumeier, and is, quite frankly, an awful awful movie. You're better off watching reruns of the RoboCop tv show on the Sci-Fi channel because that series is actually created by the original writers and it ignores the events of any of the RoboCop sequels." "This movie was so cool! Fully packed with action and fun! This movie's got it all, from gas stations blowing up to a guy melting after a toxic waste bath. Robocop is just so cool, he's like a walking wrecking crew. This movie had a good plot, great characters, solid acting a lot of one liners and funny scenes. Good job by Weller, I especially like how he handled the two guys harassing the girl. Peter Weller probably does a mean robot on the dance floor!" "as far as sci-fi/action movies go, this one is a work of pure genius. i still haven't seen any film since come close to the hybrid of extreme graphic violence and dark humor that this classic combined so seemlessly and effectively. the basic plot involves a good cop who is viciously shot down in the line of duty and resurrected from death's door as the cyborg Robocop. the violence in this film is extreme and graphic (the X-rated director's cut is even bloodier!) but isn't sold as exploitation. the movie is never meanspirited in it's tone and the humor elements elevate it to something other than a gore fest. the special effects, particulary the brilliant stop motion animation by f/x genius Phil Tippett, are fantastic and much better than the CGI effects that have become so commonplace in today's market. Director Paul Verhoeven brings the perfect touch to this material. the non-Verhoeven directed Robocop 2 was particulary mean and lacked the cool and quirky touch he brings to his films (such as Starship Troopers). the editing is also fluid and helps amplify the action scenes. the only thing that is a slight letdown is the ending, but after the energy expended in the other sections of the film, this fault is acceptable and doesn't detract TOO much. a violent classic that has yet to be equaled. rating:9.5" "This movie rocks. This is one of the best Sci-fi action movies ever...it's even better than The Matrix. Peter Weller gives a gripping performance as Alex Murphy, a maverick cop who gets gunned down in the line of duty and is resurrected by a shady Industry as Robocop, the ultimate crime fighter. But when his memory begins to resurface, he sets out on a do-or-die mission of vengeance and justice. Loaded with great action sequences and unexpectedly moving, this film is a true epic." "I was very excited when I had the opportunity to watch this film on TV. I was so interested and fascinated in the \"robocop\" idea. Yes, it was a confusing and fascinating idea. \"The Old Detroit\" has been covered by the shadow of crime, its police department has been losing cops everyday, now they are about to strike, and even worse, the police are run by a corporation called OCP. Dick Jones (Ronny Cox) of the company has a cyborg cop plan- Ed 209, which is a failure and Jones is in fact secretly connected with the head criminal of Old Detroit, Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith). Meanwhile, Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer) who also works for OCP, who is young, ambitious, has another better project about building a part human, part machine cop. \"Now we're waiting for a foolish volunteer\", he says. Officer Alex J. Murphy (Peter Weller) has been just transferred from the south precinct to the west precinct and becomes the partner of Officer Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen). While chasing a group of bank robbers they goes to a steel factory, Lewis is hit and faints, and Murphy is savagely shot dead by the gangsters. His body is being used by OCP and he becomes the half man, half machine \"robocop\". Apparently robocop seems to be a better kind of police officer to \"uphold the law\" and to \"protect the innocent\" in the future, but as a matter of fact, he is only a tool for the corporation to pursue more power. The part which \"robocop\" goes back to Murphy's home really moved me. He realizes that the house is empty and his wife and son are gone (Obviously the people in charge haven't blanked his memory successfully). All in all there are a lot of stunning action scenes in this film (Although I still don't understand why those people want to make a part human robocop instead of a complete robot). And I feel truly sorry for Murphy's pathetic fate. Nancy Allen as a sympathetic police officer who helps Murphy rediscover who he really is." "This movie is in with other classics such as with Aliens and The Terminator movies. A science fiction action movie about the near future when the police force is run by corporations. The film is funny with lots of great one liners like \"Dead or Alive, your coming with me.\" It also makes fun of stuff like cars with awful gas mileage. The 6000 SUX. :) Unfortunately, that is not far from the truth. Featuring great special affects for then, they are now cheesy and outdated, but it really dosen't matter that much. This is a great classic, and I recommend you see it soon. But be forewarned, it is such a violent movie that it was first rated X, for violence. There is hardly any sex in it. Someone gets run over, stabbed, it's all in there. Just imagine the Matrix with blood and guts. Then your getting the idea.." "Before FIGHT CLUB satirized the corporate gluttony of America, the last great movie to hold a mirror up to American society was ROBOCOP, and a great many people hate this movie, because it's a satire about our commercial and material-obessed culture. For example: ED 209 pokes fun at overpriced military weapons systems that don't work, its just an excuse to spend money, because if the military doesn't spend all of their alloted budget, then they don't get the same amount of money to work with. The SUX 6000 car that gets 6 miles to the gallon or something like that needs no explanation! \"Does it get cruise control?!?\" Don't forget the infamous TV commercials for the heart transplant machine and the \"nuke 'em\" home game. The efforts of OCP to tear down old Detroit, i.e. the mostly minority inhabited inner city is a perfect example of what happened in New York City around Times Square. The Mayors office would like you to believe they cleaned up the city, but homelessness, prostitution and drug use are as rampant as ever, they've just gotten better at hiding it, much like the \"Silver City\" of Robocop was really nothing more than a very expensive paint job. What's brilliant about Robocop is that they've managed to make a smart, funny movie all the while incorporating great action sequences. A movie like this doesn't work without over the top villains, and Ronny Cox and Kurthwood Smith are happy to oblige, and to a more sinister, subtler extent so is the great character actor Dan O'Herily."

"This is probably the most daring Hollywood film of the last 20 years, but the success of its method is questionable. It attempts to expose the fascism inherent in modern American life. This is an admirable aim. The method it uses though is equally fascist. On the one level it succeeds - we are left in no doubt that there's something rotten in the state of Denmark. There are some brilliant, if obvious, observations about post-modernism, corporate greed, and Cronenbergian man/machine erotics. But the actual plot and sensual pleasure of the film is quite fascist too, and I certainly didn't feel enough distance from my pleasure and the implications of it. Of course, that is my fault. Whoops." "Despite being an ultra-violent sci-fi action picture with comic-book violence and dark humorous overtones, the storyline in RoboCop is almost Shakespearian in style. The plot is a vague retelling of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein with a computer-age twist. The late Officer Alex Murphy returns as a cybernetic revenant to avenge his own murder, and at the same time struggles with his own monstrous nature. I rank RoboCop among the top 10 science fiction films of all time for its poignant if unsubtle social commentary on the 80s, its storyline, and of course, the special effects. The acting is effective for the genre. Kurtwood Smith is outstanding as the evil gang leader. Most of all I liked RoboCop because it is the only time I can remember actually being scared in the theater. It scared me even more the second time I saw it even though I knew what was coming. A word about the violence: This may be the most violent film ever made. I understand that when the MPAA originally rated it, it received an 'X' rating -- the first film ever to get an 'X' rating for *violence*. A few scenes got clipped to get down to an 'R', but those scenes are restored in the director's cut. I think this is Verhoeven's masterpiece, and I'm proud to have it in my collection." "When i first watched this film it was in the same league as \"THE TERMINATOR\" and still is its an action packed vision of the future run by evil buisness men its got humor and the catchy one liners, some bits in gore especially the dvd which has everything and the feel sorry for the cop bit aswell as he regains his past memories and the short evil bad guy with his gang. It was followed by an ok sequel a bad prequel and an even worse tv series but i strongly recommend you see this film." "A good sci-fi movie that takes a satirical view of the corporate world and the sad direction our society is taking. This movie did seem too violent at times (like when Murphy gets blown to bits at point blank range) but I have to say this is one of my favourite movies of all time. It would be sweet to see this movie's special FX redone with todays CGI tecnology. I found the robot special FX blah but for its time I suppose it was good. The story though was top notch. I also found the \"I'll buy that for a dollar\" spoof pretty comparable to some of todays crap like jerry springer, etc etc. Just another example of where our society is heading I suppose." "RoboCop is a great film. The other two Robo-films don't come close to the original. Probably still one of the darkest, most violent movies I have ever seen - yet its still rather charming. The dark humour and one-liners are movie magic. Rent this film, its a classic. *****" "Robocop is a great movie which you already know i think. Well, anyways I this movie is even better on dvd. More overkill yes a quality that made the movie so good. This movie is well acted and has a good plot which is rare for and action well scfi/action movie i guess youd call it but i was surprised i was expecting a shoot em up bang action movie but what i got was a masterpiece." "Robocop is just one of those movies you will never get tired of. It established Paul Verhoeven, my favorite director, as a Hollywood filmmaker, and gave the US a taste of the Dutch director's style. The whole recklessness of it all appeals greatly to me, and that is why this is on my top ten action movie list of all time, it's great! The SFX are mind-blowing, especially for 1987! The only criticism I have of the film, is that the really cool scenes all happened in daylight. There weren't any exceptionally exciting action scenes at night, and you have to have one of those in a great shoot-em-up these days. All in all, this is a great movie, with a little bit taken from the Terminator, but a great plot of its own, and enough blood to fill two movies. Oh, yeah, almost forgot. \"Dead or alive, you're coming with me,\" is the greatest one-liner ever; in any movie! Peter Weller is perfect as Robo, and Ronny Cox the perfect 'behind it all' bad guy. Thumbs way up!" "This is probably the best robot film of all time, I just kept laughing the whole movie. When Kenny gets shot by ED-209, when Murphy gets killed, when the thug gets shot in the groin, they were all great death scenes. I couldn't stop laughing when Clarence said, \"Well, give the man a hand!\" after he blew Murphy's hand off. Kurtwood Smith played the best villain I have ever seen in a movie. Right down to the beady little glasses it reminds me of Hitler. The only problem I have is the plot holes in it. What was the purpose of the food Robocop was supposed to eat? He doesn't have a butt now, so how is he going to crap it out? I sure hope it doesn't build up in his stomach and when he is saying a criminals rights it comes out of his mouth like vomit. Another plot hole is the skin on Robocop's head. Since Robocop isn't really a living thing, wouldn't the flesh rot after a while? I sure hope they keep a bottle of fly spray in the police office. The last problem I have is how did Robocop remember his former life? Didn't they blank his memory? They probably hit his head with a hammer and said, \"That's it!\"" "For all its almost cartoonish violence and grim theme, RoboCop is an extraordinarily prescient satire of the levels to which society can, and in some cases already has, degenerated. From runaway corporate greed to preposterous three-shift-class cocaine processing plants, RoboCop only missed becoming a seminal warning piece because far too many people were satisfied with it as merely an action film. Nonetheless, repeat viewings only strengthen this film, and make its sequels that much more tragically bad. \"I'd buy that for a dollar!\"" "A truly superb science fiction action movie which has become a modern day classic. ROBOCOP centres around a police officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) in Detroit in the not so distant future who is brutally gunned down and later rebuilt as a cyborg by OCP (the company who 'owns' the police) as part of an experiment. As well as an original idea, a good cast and admirable special effects (for 1987) the film also has a strong story to it. Weller is okay in the title role while standouts are Miguel Ferrer as ROBOCOP's creator and Kurtwood Smith who relishes his role as chief bad guy Clarence Bodicker. Absolutely great stuff, however many times you have seen it, it's just a shame that it spawned such awful sequels and a laughably cheap cash in of a TV series. \"Your move Creep..\"" "Add another review" "Find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your Watchlist and rate your favorite movies and TV shows on your phone or tablet!")("Movies, TV & Showtimes" "Celebs, Events & Photos" "News & Community" "Watchlist" "" "Find industry contacts & talent representation" "Manage your photos, credits, & more" "Showcase yourself on IMDb & Amazon" "Sign in with Facebook Other Sign in options" "Own the rights?" "Having recently acquired the director's cut of Robocop. I got a sneaking suspicion that I wouldn't like it half as much as I did when I was 15. I've always defended this story of a future world where even the police force is run by a corrupt corporation. Murphy, a dedicated cop, is killed by a gang of criminals, and his body is soon transformed into an experimental cyborg policeman. But can the corporation who built him totally erase his past? Will the bad guys just keep on getting badder, and will the corporation delve deeper into corruption? I don't think we need two guesses at the answers to these questions! There's something quaintly old fashioned about Robocop. Peter Weller's moral cop/robot reminds me of various figures from old Westerns, but in most other respects the film is very much a product of it's time. The themes addressed are the themes of the 80s - TV, nuclear war, globalisation, urban violence, etc. Watching Robocop again makes you realise that all these issues are still with us - we're just so used to having them presented to us through highly paid spin doctors that we don't see them for what they are. Is Robocop's Omni Consumer Products really so far away from the enormous media and consumer conglomerations that have formed in the 12 years since it was released? As much as Verhoeven would like us to read such deeper issues into the film, it doubtlessly works best on a much simpler level. As an 80s action flick, it has few parallels, being exceptionally well made, exceptionally violent (especially the director's cut) and almost, but not quite, as entertaining as it was when I was 15. The casual blasting away of the bad guys may cause a few fascist, right-wing alarm bells to ring in my head these days, but it's a solid bit of fun while it lasts. The acting is generally decent, and the dialogue passable, but some of the effects seem very dated now - indeed, I seem to recall they looked pretty bad in 1987 too! I may no longer consider it to be quite as important a film these days, but it'll still go down well if I'm in the right mood. And there are many scenes that anyone who sees it will always remember - the melting man anyone? I guess that, had Verhoeven toned down his message and his delivery somewhat, then Robocop may have been just another routine video rental. Maybe his blunt style can be an asset after all...(!)" "When I was younger i had three favorite movies. '' TMN Turtles '', '' Conan '' and '' RoboCop ''. I thought RoboCop was too cool to be true. And i still think so. Complaining about the voilence and the blood is stupid. It's after all a '' Shoot em up-movie '' ( new kind of word ). And this is also a classic movie for every actionfans. I am not an actionfan. I can watch any kind of movie. It could be action, drama, romance, sci-fi, adventure, war movies, you name it. So I give this movie a well deserved * * * ½ out of five and 7 out of 10. '' Dead or alive you're coming with me ''." "RoboCop could have been the start of a great franchise. Instead the brand name piffled-out after the sequel and has since languished in the hell of TV shows, animated TV shows and mini-series crap. Paul Verhoeven's multi-layered original provided a platform for so much potential and possibility, it's a shame we only got 2 good movies out of it. Alex Murphy is a deeply unlucky cop who has transferred into Detroit's (actually Dallas) worst precinct. On his first day on the job he is gunned down by the stupendously evil Clarence Boddicker (a brilliant turn by Kurtwood Smith) and his gang of nasty thugs. Resurrected as some kind of Frankenstien/Christ figure, Murphy returns as RoboCop-The Future of Law Enforcement. In the world of RoboCop big business rules and public servants can be bought as stock (doesn't sound so unrealistic does it?). A super-conglomerate called Omni Consumer Products has entered into an agreement to fund and run the Detroit Police Force. Wishing to create a cop who doesn't need to eat or sleep they have a choice of pursuing the RoboCop idea or going with Vice President, Dick Jones' idea of ED-209, a mech-like twin cannon on legs. The CEO goes with RoboCop, leaving Jones with a personal vendetta against poor Robo. It may have been satire back in 1987 but today we are all to used to doomsday news being delivered by smile by our news anchors only to cut to an ad feature some violent video game or movie. The violence, social commentary and horror of RoboCop can sometimes pale in comparison to real life. When you're 7 years old, RoboCop is probably just the most amazing thing ever. I swear, I must have seen this film about 100 times when I was a kid. I was word-perfect on it. Even erm...note-perfect on Basil Poledouris' awesome, awesome score.I guess it's kind of unfair on kids these days that they are raised on braindead PG-13 crap while I got one bloody action movie after another back in the 80s. RoboCop is no doubt a classic. It's a shame it had such an indignant death. Still, I guess this is still a chance for re-resurrection. But please...no remake!" "Robocop is a great sci-fi movie. It has lots of blood in it. The acting is great. The story is great. The special effects are great. This movie kicks a**! Robocop never showed mercy to his enemies in the warehouse scene. The movie has great bad guys. Get it for DVD." "All cinema lovers get to place one guilty pleasure on their all time favourites list. Robocop is mine. Here we have a violent sci-fi film, steeped in self-parody, which still gives us one of movies great villains. No action flick works without a convincing villain and Kurtwood Smith's turn as Clarence Boddicker is perfect. He portrays a career criminal who sells drugs because its a business - he makes no other pretense and the movie does not waste our time trying to show his tortured past or making him into a closet junkie. More than anything, Robocop is a satire. The movie paints this bleak futuristic world (although we are never told that it is in the future) punctuated with sugar-coated \"everything's A-OK\" news casts and TV commercials for artificial heart transplants and a board game called Nuke'em. The entire premise of \"OCP\", the company who has privatized just about every not-for-profit public service, is far-fetched. But it works because the viewer can envision it happening, and because the movie drops you unabashedly into this incredible world. Also pay close attention to the old DOS commands that are displayed when the camera views from inside Robocop's visor. Its a throw-back to the first PCs. Director Paul Verhoeven fills the screen with so many wonderful enjoyable images, and works a plot so subtle that you may well miss most of the symbolism the first time around. This is a movie worth viewing over and over. The only knock on this film for me is that is gave way to two of the most horrid sequels ever made. Avoid them at all costs. **** out of ****." "I have a special place in my heart for mid-to-late eighties actioners (Predator, Beverly Hills Cop, Midnight Run, Commando, Lethal Weapon, Die Hard etc.) - they don't make them like they used to. For some reason, late 90s actioners are so lame and trepid - like Speed 2, Daylight, Cliffhanger, Lethal Weapon 4, Twister, GoldenEye etc. Bring back McTiernan, Shane Black, Tony Scott (Enemy Of The State leans too much onto the spy side of things) and let's not forget Paul Verhoen, whose RoboCop is a defining eighties actioner. What separates RoboCop from most other actioners is the world it's set in, in the 'near' future. It's not typically post-apocalyptic or terribly grim as most films show it to be, but shown to be PURELY run by money. It's a place where big corporations run the public services, and let criminals do as they please - like a never-ending riot. The situation is so extreme, you have newsreporters making fun of some of their stories - like a crisis in a third world country. To the hardcore shoot 'em up fan, one would probably not notice this as I had on first viewing, but it proves to be a thought-provoking setting and situation. RoboCop has a great cast. Ronny Cox and Miguel Ferrer are absloutely superb as rival business executives of OCP, a big corporation whose moniker and logo are seen throughout the film frequently since this is the company that owns EVERYTHING. The rivalry is so well played out, though I don't think it has much to do with the chief plot. Weller, whose full face is rarely seen in the film, does a good job as RoboCop/Alex Murphy. The shootouts, which are pretty much all the action scenes, are well choreographed and entertaining. I especially like the scene in which RoboCop marches into a warehouse, taking out badguys left, right and centre. And his one-on-one with ED-209 robot. Finally, I must confess that the ED-209 law enforcement unit was one of the scariest things I'd ever seen. With a horrifying montonous tone and a facist programme of operation, I really was scared in seeing it mercilessly shoot a junior executive to smithereens. The line - 'YOU HAVE FIFTEEN SECONDS TO COMPLY' - I shiver in fear when I hear that. I have a fascination for eighties films - especially ones that are action and 'very eighties' and so I love RoboCop." "Robocop is Paul Verhoeven's best film! Truly exciting, funny, dramatic, and action packed. Thankfully, now there is a director's cut on laserdisc and DVD, which has restored cuts which were removed to avoid an X rating. I watched it, and personally, I think the MPAA was very uptight in their decision. The cuts desperately needed to be there. The overall feeling and impact was changed to what it needed to be. For example, in the scene where police officer Murphy was murdered, he seemed just like an unlucky victim to a \"firing squadron\". In the director's cut, it is almost painful to watch! It not only makes his death memorable and pitiful, but it throws a dark shadow over the film that never leaves you. Even when Robocop was in the stages of being built, that murder scene was always in the back of my mind. It was so much more powerful, and set up a conflict between Murphy and the criminals which pays off at the end of the film. The director's cut isn't even a minute longer than its predecessor, and yet, it is a stronger version of the movie. It's great! But beware, it's not for the squeamish! Those of you who have seen the director's cut know exactly what I'm talking about." "Despite yet more blood guts and violence from Paul Verhoven, I was stunned when I first saw Robocop. At first I was captured by the non-stop violence but on more recent viewings I am caught deep in the storyline about a cop who has his life ripped from him and replaced by that of violence. I think people should forget Verhoven's reputation of sex and violence in his films as they are just his way of portraying an amazing story." "Called by Ken Russell \"the greatest science-fiction film since Metropolis,\" controversial director Paul Verhoeven's ROBOCOP is a special effects-laden cult phenomenon. The film features a resurrected and roboticized hero in a new, supercharged cyborg body, struggling to reclaim his memory and avenge his own death.Robocop looks into the future with a combination of fear and humor. It is a world clearly projected from the time it was made--the excessive 80's--and gives us a place where corporations control everything, even the public departments like the police. Cops no longer serve the public, they are pawns in a corporate game.Paul Verhoeven did a modern classic and a staple of science fiction. This movie is reckless disregard for human life and public property but still a great action-sci-fi classic and if you like Paul Verhoeven works do not miss this one......" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "If you revisit some of the sci-fi movies of the Seventies and Eighties like \"Star Wars\" and this one, you realize just how clunky some of the special effects were. As an example, you would think the designer of an attack droid would have given some thought to the idea that maybe it would eventually encounter a set of stairs at some point. When that attack droid flipped and started flailing it's legs it looked just hilarious. So it's 2014 now, some twenty seven years since this movie came out, and old Detroit still hasn't been replaced. You'd think they would put a whole army of Robocops in there to straighten things out. Actually, the way things are going, we may not be far from it what with flying drones being unleashed across the country and government surveillance at an all time high. Sure wish we could turn that clock back. Well I saw this when it first came out and again just the other day. Not much has changed in my perception of the flick; it's an entertaining blend of sci-fi and action with all manner of corporate outlaws looking to make a score with the latest in technology. Peter Weller is outstanding in the Robocop get-up, I was particularly amused each time he did one of those awkward twists with his head to signal a new direction he was going in. Ron Cox was perfect as the number two man at Omni Consumer Products, but he probably should have thought things through a bit more with his programming team. If all it took to get knocked out of the picture was getting fired, why wouldn't he simply design Robocop not to harm him under any circumstances. Pretty simple solution really. Say, how did the Robocop armor get fixed up every time he got shot up? That's what I'd like to know."

"In the last several years, Hollywood has made a habit of remaking, 'sequeling', 'prequeling' and rebooting anything they can get their greedy hands on. These unnecessary spin-offs rarely work as quality movies, but apparently they are very profitable. Long story short, this year (among other things) we will get a remake of the 1987 Action/Sci-Fi classic RoboCop. Although I strongly oppose remaking RoboCop (but I oppose remakes in general), this review wasn't meant to serve as criticism of the remake, but as a look back to, and a glorification of, the original movie. I will be tackling the remake when it is released, of course. In spite of being considered a classic action movie today, back in the day almost every big director passed on the opportunity of directing RoboCop  before Paul Verhoeven eventually settled as the director; and he also would have passed the opportunity if it weren't for a pleasant turn of events of his wife reading the script and convincing him to direct it. The reason I'm mentioning this is because Paul Verhoeven is the ideal director for such a movie, and if it weren't for him, I doubt RoboCop would have achieved the cult status it has. But I'll get to that in a moment. 'RoboCop' is set in a futuristic/dystopian version of the city of Detroit, which has a big problem with crime, and the police can't seem to do a thing. The police's main problem is one Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith), who is a notorious cop killer and the crime boss of 'Old Detroit'. Besides him, the police has trouble dealing with Omni Consumer Products (OCP), a company which signed a contract with the city that puts them in charge of controlling the city's security and police department. As an attempt at decreasing the city's crime rate, OCP has been developing some weapon programs  amidst which is a certain Robocop program, that would create a cyborg super cop who could easily deal with the troublesome crime rate. Luckily for them, a cop named Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) gets killed on duty, and they decide to run the prototype of the Robocop program using his dead body. To be honest, the concept of the movie does sound a bit ridiculous (which might explain why everyone passed the opportunity of directing it), but that's exactly why Paul Verhoeven is the perfect choice for directing it. He easily manages to turn the source material upside down and create something that is, at the same time, excessively violent, funny and satirical. And in that way 'RoboCop' isn't much different from Verhoeven's 1997 underrated gem Starship Troopers. His subtle director trademarks (the commercials in the movie and the religious imagery) are precisely what makes 'RoboCop' a good movie that stands out from other/similar action movies. Furthermore, Verhoeven directing is absolutely brilliant (the scenes in which RoboCop gets revealed come to mind) and he puts just the right amount of excessive, sometimes cartoonish, violence in the movie, in order not to avoid the campiness of the movie's premise. All of this makes 'RoboCop' a very unique and enjoyable experience which wouldn't have been possible without Verhoeven. Of course, not all of 'RoboCop' is Verhoeven's one man show. Props should be given to the people who designed the suit and to Kurtwood Smith, who plays the villain  Clarence Boddicker. His Boddicker is menacing, unpredictable and crazy, and the rule 'each film is only as good as its villain' undoubtedly works for 'RoboCop'. The only minor flaws that could be attributed to 'RoboCop' are that some of the special effects are really outdated, and that Peter Weller's role in the movie is unusually small, in spite of him being the titular character: he doesn't do much in terms of acting (more flashbacks could have helped with that problem). But I understand that some people may consider these as nitpicks. Finally, just like the old saying goes  'if it ain't broke, don't fix it'. Got that, Hollywood? Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/" "This film from the eighties still packs quite a punch, it doesn't seem to have dated at all; the action is still as exciting as ever and there are still scenes where I want to look away. Set in the crime ridden Detroit of the near future Peter Weller plays Officer Murphy who has just been transferred to one of the roughest precincts in the city. He is partnered with Officer Lewis, played by Nancy Allen. Unfortunately for him he is soon shot and left clinically dead. At this point OCP, a company that is running the privatised police force and has hopes to rebuild Detroit, steps in and replaces most of his body with cybernetic parts and erases his memory. Once back on the job he quickly makes an impression as he apprehends several criminals but all is not working according to OCP's plan as he starts to dream about his past life and then begins to search for those responsible for his death. This film fits in several genres: crime, Sci-fi, action, Dystopia, black comedy... if you are a fan of any it is worth watching, the acting is good through out as are the special effects, no obvious CGI like many of today's films. It is surprising that this isn't as well known these days as films like \"The Terminator\" and \"Die Hard\", I suspect it is due to the fact that the sequels were noticeably inferior to this." "I liked it more as an action movie than a sci-fi satire. The violence was suitably brutal and the action was fairly terrific, but the satiric elements were pretty mild and not as biting as I expected. It seemed to work better as a cheezy B-movie than anything else. Murphy's execution scene could be the most gruesome and horrifying scene I've ever seen, not just because of the gore but because of the context. It just disturbed me, something that doesn't happen a lot. Weller is fine - for a cyborg - but this film is all about Kurtwood Smith. Probably one of the best villain performances ever. The rest of the film is fairly mediocre; on the whole, it's entertaining and quotable, but not really deep or meaningful." "I am a huge fan of Robocop. I was about 7 or 8 when i first saw the films and i loved them and not because of the graphic violence or high levels of swearing! I have continued to watch them to this day and still never get bored of them. Sublime. People often ignore the next 2, they were still mighty fine even if not as good. If you are a true Robo fan, you wont have failed to notice the TV series, which again, will never be a match to the movies, is still top class cause at the end of the day, its Robocop. Its not just the sci-fi or violence, he's a guy with a heart and its the true story and later successes that make the movies what they are. Probably, my favourite line has got to be the famous \"Stay out of trouble\". Peter Weller was just incredible and i would welcome any day a fourth, a fifth and even a sixth. As is said before, its not the violence i liked. At times, particularly toward the latter stages of the picture, it gets quite comical, you know, the bit at the old sludge plant. I actually disliked the extent to which Verhoeven deemed it necessary to portray Murphy's downfall. Nonetheless, there are many clever elements incorporated into Murphy's legacy. These include the supporting cast, the stuff he says and the side issues of the regeneration of Delta City and the idea of Omni Comsumer Products. Its not just a case of cops chasing the bad guys, as Verhoeven was successful in showing. I loved the characters of Sgt. Reed and Mr. Kurt Smith who played a very believable fugitive in a corrupt Delta City. Finally, the ending \"Nice shooting, what's you're name\" and Robo replies with Murphy before closing on the end credits, with some of the greatest ever movie music ever, by Basil Poledouris. Absolutely Superb!" "Robocop is every man's fantasy film. We have action, gore, boobs, car chases, and some comedy thrown in. Peter Weller is great as Murphy, the cop who gets wasted by Clarence (Kurtwood Smith who looks like Lee Bowles) and turned into Robocop. It would have been nice to see Karen Allen naked but alas she isn't. Check out Carrie if you want to see her wool (I'll buy that for a dollar!). Get the unrated version of Robocop so you can see all of Rob Bottin's excellent make up effects." "Let me just say, I like this film alot, but there are some problems I have with it. First of all: I would have liked to see Murphy more as a human. We dont get to see him much that way. It would have been nice, if the story had taken the time needed to show us more of Murphys life as a human. It would have been better. The other problem I have is Murphys death. What leads up to it, two cops dumb enough not to wait for backup and go in to take on a large number of triggerhappy badguys, that alone is unbelievable. And Murphy calling Clarence slime, when he got 5 or 6 men pointing guns at him, seems pretty dumb too. Hes asking for it. But stil, the way they keep on shooting him over and over again. And it never seems to end. Of course in real life he would have been dead on the floor, long before they had run out of ammo. Before Clarence blew his brains out. Nobody can survive to be shot that many times. But the way he stands there and screams in pain as they just pump him full of bullits. Its too much and unnessecary. Of course, every time he kills one of the psychoes that blew him away, it feels really good, but they could have killed him in a less violent way. If instead they had just beat him up and then shot him in the head instead, then it would have been easier to watch. If not, at least Lewis could have shot the badguys. Or some of them. They never bothered to kill her before they left and they knew she was there. She might not have made it, but she could have saved Murphys life. Also, the movie never deals with Murphys life as a machine. Imagine waking up and your body is gone. Its been replaced by a mechanical body. Youve lost your penis. You can never make love to a woman again, you can never even have a girlfriend. Murphy has lost his body, his wife and his son. And probably his relatives too. And it never makes him lose his mind. That he doesnt kill himself is unrealistic. I know this movie is not suppose to be taken seriously, but it does deal with Murphys loss. And yet, it doesnt deal with it enough. It would have been interested if they had made a different movie where Murphy does get shot, but survives after surgery. A regular copmovie where he goes out with Lewis and kills all the men that shot him. Or they could have made Lewis into Robocop and Murphy as her human partner." "The 1980s had more bad science fiction movies than I can count. Some of these science fiction movies were bad and yet entertaining while others were just plain bad. ROBOCOP was one of those rare science fiction movies that actually didn't suck. It was good. Really good. It's a movie that I have seen at least ten times and I am proud to say that is one of my favorites. The directing is great, the writing is great, everything about the movie is great. The sequel, ROBOCOP 2, is good, but not quite as good as this one. Avoid the second sequel, ROBOCOP 3, at all costs." "Robocop (1987) was an thrilling science fiction comic book movie from Paul Verhoven. It's also a hard hitting satire at a society driven by consumerism, ultra right wing politics and a collapse from within. Crime is at an all time high,poverty is rampant, the streets are a war zone and the police department is being run by a corporation who only cares about the bottom dollar. During one incident, a decorated police officer named Murphy and his partner were in pursuit of a gang of ruthless bank robbers, during a bloody firefight and encounter Murphy is mortally wounded. Meanwhile O.C.P. is looking to implement their new super cop program but they need a involuntary volunteer for the job. Lo and behold they found one in Murphy. Will he be a successful candidate? Can Robocop do the job? Is there any light at the end of the tunnel? Will Robocop survive the rough streets of Detriot and save the day? Paul Weller stars as Officer Murphy, a candidate chosen to become part of the new Robocop program. Nancy Allen co-stars as his partner, Miguel Ferrer is the head of the project, Ronny Cox is his nemesis and board room rival. Kurtwood Smith is th leader of a gang of psychos and sociopaths. What makes the movie cool is the sheer graphic violence, witty dialog and a bunch of stand out characters. The direction is flawless and the cinematography is top notched. Verhoven and writer Edward Neumeir would work with each other again on the highly underrated science fiction flick Starship Troopers. Both films have the same criticism of conservative governments and societies. They're highly recommended and they can be seen together as companion pieces. Highest recommendation possible!" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This film begins in a dystopian future with the city of Detroit faced with a horrendous crime wave coupled with massive unemployment. As the story unfolds a cop by the name of \"Ajax J. Murphy\" (Peter Weller) is reassigned from one precinct within the city to the most difficult and crime-ridden area of all. To make things even worse a big corporation known as \"OCP\" has essentially taken over control of the police department and virtually dictate all policy and procedures. So when Murphy get shot and killed in the line-of-duty they take his body and transform him into a cyborg which gives him increased strength and gun accuracy but at the cost of a complete loss of memory. Also included in his transformation is a secret protocol known as the \"4th directive\" intended to benefit those within OCP. Although there isn't anything Murphy can do about this his memory begins to return to a limited degree when his partner \"Officer Anne Lewis\" (Nancy Allen) attempts to remind him of certain events just prior to his being killed. In the meantime, however, office politics within the corporation begin to become a bigger problem to Murphy than the armed criminals out on the street. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I remember watching this movie when it first came out and I continue to enjoy it to this day. Of course, it suffers a bit due to the passage of time but that is only to be expected. In any case, I encourage those interested in a movie of this type to check it out and I have rated it accordingly. Above average." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Be forewarned! A lot of blood, gore, bullets and swear words are in this film. That being said, a great concept film later turned into 2 uneven sequels, a 2014 remake, and a somewhat-successful TV series. So many errors and goofs which, for the most part, are mostly \"signage\" problems and techno-issues. I didn't have time to \"catch\" the rest of them as I was too busy watching the film. It is so obvious that this film wasn't filmed anywhere remotely near Detroit. There is even an out-of-state steel mill. Like all Verhoeven films, more big guns than imaginable. The depicted use of \"coke\" is totally inappropriate and the annoying \"I'd pay a dollar for that\" dirty-minded TV video gets old very fast. I love the fake news and tacky commercials. Peter Weller in that tin can suit looks very hot and sweaty! The \"rogue\" cyborg looks stop motion animated but that is before CGI. I am still surprised that there were no laser weapons. Some on the mattes are unconvincing. Somewhat better to watch on cable as the fowl language is greatly cleaned or cut. The acid-dissolving \"henchman\" would give any little kid nightmares. It's convenient that the dirty water dilutes it so that no one else dies that way! I also like (although not as much) Robocop 2."

"*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "The American baptism of Verhoeven is solved with an atypical and violent Sci-Fi film, in which subtle secrets are hidden that can be applied to both political and private organisms. The desire to put into the hands of the machines the security and comfort of citizen security was not a new idea, but the Dutch director knew to give a much more forceful turn in its development, in which the irony is part of a more visceral argument That intellectual. Thus Robocop begins in a future in which violence has reached such a degree that cities choose to delegate private security to citizens, which does not solve the problems of corruption but rather moves them to another area. The idea of ​​the perfect policeman comes from the fusion of what is left of a supposedly murdered policeman with mechanical devices that are supposed to make him invulnerable to criminal attacks. And crime is one of the expositions that best summarizes the film, since crime is directly linked to the corruption of those who are supposed to eradicate it. But it is not all Robocop-Frankenstein, although the director pursues a goal that goes a step beyond the merely commercial, does not turn the film into a trivial moralistic message, but it is a film in which his possible messages do not Interfere with the reality of a science fiction film with great doses of action. Thus, an atypical film was characterized by the insertion of advertising criticizing consumerism and the cold reaction of people to important problems such as pollution, health or ecology, deceitful corporative traps that far from seeking the solution to the social problems benefits from them. We see how the promoter of the first robot uses repressive and uncommunicative methods in the program installed in the machine, which in a first trial ends with the death of an executive whom they treat as if a setback was treated without showing the slightest feeling For the life of the unfortunate director, who the rest of the people urgently request an ambulance, something totally ridiculous after having received a whole countless arsenal of bullets. The creator of Robocop also does not escape the critic Verhoeven style, is a kind of Dr. Frankenstein who does not hesitate to treat a fallen policeman as a product owned by a company willing to experiment with the limits of the human mind, selfish and selfish, Its sole aim is equally the lust for power. \"Robocop\" is a generous film that hides pleasing surprises, which neither adorns violence nor treats it delicately, but shows the wild and selfish side of the times." "RoboCop (1987) is the finest cyberpunk action movie one of my favorite films of all time. I grew up with this movie, it has a special place in my heart and I love it to death. Here you have everything: brilliant story, good actors, stunts, puppetry, models, and good Special Effects. This is Paul Verhoeven and Peter Weller's best movie from the 80's they ever made. I used to had this movie on VHS but over the years the tape was eaten from VHS recorder so that I couldn't watch the movie properly anymore. 3 years earlier I got this movie on Blu-ray Unrated director's cut and my Blu-ray player scratched and eat the Blu-ray disc so I purchased the director's cut again on Blu-ray and I was blown away with the movie how good it is. RoboCop it's not an action in the film itself, that makes this be the case. This is especially odd in a movie with a $50 million budget (in 1987!), with multiple huge explosions, with hundreds of bullets fired, and scores of stuntmen used. 30 year's anniversary is coming in July since the movie was released and it is a shame that Miguel Ferrer aka Bob Morton died this year in January R.I.P. we miss you. This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task. The movie it self has heart and soul in it, the fact is you have a human being who loses his humanity and it brought back to life, he is resurrected and he is a superhuman super cop who once again regains his humanity and his trouble been robot and human. When Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) takes off his helmet we see a sad mourning man who lost everything. I felt really sorry for Alex who was shot and killed I was really moved and sad by his death who lost his family. Peter Weller stars in the film as Alex Murphy, a Detroit police officer who after being gunned down by a vicious gang, is resurrected by a mega-corporation as the cybernetic law enforcement officer of the future. As he begins his new life as \"RoboCop\", Murphy starts to regain a bit of his humanity with the help of his former partner Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen). The popularity of the RoboCop character would spawn a RoboCop franchise consisting of, among other media, two more feature films, a 1994 live-action series, two animated television series, a four-part movie miniseries as well as a 2014 remake. Actors Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, Ronny Cox, Kurtwood Smith and Miguel Ferrer do all job well and they deliver the movie as an entertaining action flick. I love the puppetry of droid ED-209 who has a lot of fire power and the costume and the suit for RoboCop was beautiful designed. Themes that make up the basis of RoboCop include media influence, gentrification, corruption, authoritarianism, greed, privatization, capitalism, identity, dystopia, and human nature. It is an rated R action film and I wish there would be movies like this today. I love the Music score by Basil Poledouris which it is my favorite score and it is a classic orchestra. The stunts are completely insane in scale (we have a lot of glass scenes like Ed-209 fires cannon guns on Robo and he flies trough glass door. Robo fires his gun on Dick (Ronnie Cox) and he flies trough window.) Robo punches a terrorist in mayor's office and he falls from the window. Of course, this wouldn't be an action movie without some action. There's plenty of it, and it's perfectly done. The gunplay is delivered in perfect Verhoeven style (as opposed to the slo-mo John Woo-style) -- you'll see lots of heavy automatic, shotguns and explosive cannon weapons, and you'll see them used well. The film is violent, and bloody with real blood squibs. It is also up to the script to deliver the real substance of the movie. (One often sees great performances in mediocre films... here the story transcends the performances -- an impressive feat.) The script delivers. The film is absolutely filled with great, classic moments (I counted TEN all-star ones during my last viewing), and they're evenly spaced through the movie. I love how RoboCop prevents two armed robberies, a rape which he shoots the rapist in the dick, he bust a drug factory on by him self, he stops and punches a terrorist and saves the hostages in the mayor office, he stops a violent gang by himself and he stops a corrupt business man. Best scene: ED-209 moves its right gun-arm cannon on RoboCop (Peter Weller) but Robo grabs it and shoves it away just before ED fires. ED continues firing as Robo shoves the gun towards ED's left gun-arm, destroying it. ED-209 fires one of its missiles at RoboCop. The missiles were actual rockets guided with wires. RoboCop (1987) is a classic one of the best action films my all time favorite action films of mine that defines my childhood. This movie has a heart, and that you cannot deny. Plus, it simply rocks. 10/10 RoboCop is a 1987 American cyberpunk action film directed by Paul Verhoeven and written by Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner. The film stars Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, Dan O'Herlihy, Kurtwood Smith, Miguel Ferrer, and Ronny Cox. 10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Orion Pictures Starring: Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, Daniel O'Herlihy, Ronny Cox, Kurtwood Smith, Miguel Ferrer, Robert DoQui, Ray Wise, Felton Perry, Paul McCrane, Jesse Goins, Calvin Jung, Lee de Broux Director: Paul Verhoeven Producer: Arne Schmidt Screenplay: Edward Neumeier, Michael Miner Rated: R Running Time: 1Hr. 42 Mins.

And I've never regretted that act of childhood disobedience. The film stars Peter Weller as the leading man/machine/cop and he takes It as the role of a life time. After being nearly killed by a group of criminals lead by Kurtwood Smith's Clarence Bodikker with Ronny Cox's Dick Jones playing Emperor Palpatine to Smith's Darth Vader, he then becomes RoboCop who eventually sets about avenging his own murder. What we then see whilst Murphy kicks ass, killing off criminal after criminal is his journey to finding some humanity again as he ... kills relentlessly. A different stretch of humanity, I'll give you that. But It is superbly cool to see him taking down low life criminals, right up until his most successful death of Bodikker and Dick Jones. What also makes an appearance in RoboCop is ED 209 which is also a bad ass robot, but he's aligned with Dick Jones. And between all of the kick ass action scenes we also get Nancy Allen's Lewis playing Murphy's partner whilst becoming equally bad ass herself. However despite the characters themselves, the highlight of the original RoboCop is definitely the action sequences, a lot of the time It actually feels like you're right there with Murphy as he drives through Detroit dishing out swift justice. To sum RoboCop up I'd have to call It one of my more watched action movies, with a simple but effective collection of elements to go with it." "RoboCop is an all time classic action film and one of the best of the 1980's, right up there with Die Hard in my opinion. Paul Verhoeven's career began here and even though he has made a lot of questionable choices and movies (including some down right stink fests) RoboCop still stands up as awesome. One underrated thing about this movie is Peter Weller's performance, he is great and never really got the credit he deserved for this or a lot of other movies to be honest. At least with Sons of Anarchy he seems to be getting some good work again, which is a good thing. The only downside is this movie is not for everyone, it was originally rated X for a reason and is incredibly bloody and violent, so no kids allowed!" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This is the best tale of revenge ever told - and also a satire about a world where a corporation acts as the State. The premise is that a corporation runs the police - and they make decisions that are based on profit and not public safety. As a result - they want to replace police officers with robots who may be less expensive - and their prototype is Robocop. The problem is - Robocop is really a dead police officer - who after a few successful busts begins to remember how he died and he decides to violate his programming to bring his killers to justice. The film asks- can humanism endure in the face of the State as a machine - when the human in question the machine of the State itself? This movie not only has a rad moral - it has a great soundtrack, groundbreaking violence, magnificent acting, and pristine special effects. The film contains some of the best lines ever delivered on screen - and stands the test of time as a masterpiece. My dad took me to this film when I was seven years old - and I will always remember the impact it had on me. Movies like this never get made anymore. Which is sad." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "I was a teen when Robocop was released in France (january 1988) and i remember to have been a fan with its concept and design while not having seen the movie actually ! I remember also reading the novelization, playing the arcade game and to keep on drawing the character ! But i don't remember how i watched it for the 1st time maybe later with pay TV Canal + and even today with my dad's DVD, it's still a remarkable anticipation movie : in fact, this movie predicted what America has become: cupid firms, silly medias, useless politicians, urban guns violence and devastated districts and for sure, enhanced humans with electronics ! What left me in awe every time i watch it is the quality of this near future (like BTTF2 very likely) and the visual virtuosity to tell the story : Robocop vision, its arrival, its unmasking (like Dath Vader), its dreams, all those moments are really inspired and proves Verhoeven as a highly talented director ! But he is not alone as Weller does a fantastic mime job to act like a robot (with a good help from a handful of TP cast) and Poledouris adds the essential musical soul ! Maybe Verhoeven is a bit too much equating Murphy-Roboop to Jesus but the thematic of the soul in a robot is interesting, all the more put in terms of Police law ! At last, the DVD has really good bonus, in particular the deleted scenes that offers a great alternate ending !" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "What makes this film such a classic is the way in which the standard, clichéd story (itself a mixture of Frankenstein-type moralising with a more teen-orientated shoot 'em up) is given greater depths as characters are fleshed out, given real relationships, and die violently at each other's hands. Director Paul Verhoeven paints a gory, violent depiction of the future, which will come as no surprise for those familiar with the director's mainstream work (namely TOTAL RECALL and STARSHIP TROOPERS). This can only be a plus. There are numerous action sequences in the film and Verhoeven sure knows how to handle the gunfire. As well as the bloodshed, the twists and turns in the plot really add to the intrigue and we even find ourselves caring for the characters as the lines of good and evil are blurred out. Along with the great supporting story, which is kind of a hybrid Frankenstein/revenge film set in the future, there is a powerful, dramatic and pounding score which I really loved. The acting is also good. Peter Weller is very memorable and works wonders in evoking our sympathy, especially as we can only see his lower jaw for much of the film. It's here he proved his worth as a straight lead man. Nancy Allen is quite good as his sympathetic partner, the only person who really understands Murphy. Among the baddies, Kurtwood Smith has playing a callous murderer down to a tee and Ronny Cox emanates pure, sweaty, corrupted greed and evil. The special effects really add to the film in many different forms; ED-209 the stop motion monster is especially impressive, as is Robocop's design (Rob Bottin deserves thanks once again here). Make up is also used effectively. It's interesting to see how Verhoeven uses the recurring theme of satire in his fake news reports, which are very similar to the ones in STARSHIP TROOPERS, and there is even a commercial designed by the insane Chioto Brothers. Along with the action are a number of comedic scenes, the best one being where one of the gang is dissolving in toxic waste before exploding when hit by a car! All of this makes the film well worth watching and it was popular enough to spawn two sequels (the first all right, the second, atrocious) and even a television series, all of which are not as good as the original (but then, when are they?)." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "With the newest remake of this eighties classic action movie been almost forgotten I thought it was high time to review the original splatter that has left such a legacy to our culture. First of all the movie is one of the most violent, vulgar and fun flicks in history and to add to that has a great commentary to the Cold War era madness as well as the total control the corporation have in our life. And all that was in a movie about a cyborg cop in nineteen eighty seven! For real if you seat down and think about it the film kinda predicted correctly the future. Let's see: 1) Corporation getting inside public organizations check. 2) Corporation making great plans with the aid of some unethical persons check. 3) Marketing death and destruction to kids check. 4) The media becoming just a mouthpieces of corporations to sell more and keep the public hooked with stupid cutesy quotes check. 5) Drugs check!!!! 6) Detroit becoming a crime infested area. Holly Batman, they got it quit close to the real deal! I am shocked to say the least by all that facts. In the end a must watch to any man who respect himself!! And for the women who like them , already got my respect!" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Peter Weller's performance goes beyond being in a Robocop costume. He manages to elicit a degree of sympathy, especially in trying to track his wife and son. That was quite moving. The Old Man, who is the CEO of the Robocop company, is played by Dan O'Herlihy, whose son is Gavan O'Herlihy who some may recall played Chuck, the eldest of the three Cunningham children in Happy Days. One standout performance is Paul McCrane, who has a classic scene at the end with the acid vat. Wow, he really lost his head there. Kurtwood Smith is also in Robocop, and he doesn't disappointed. I especially liked Kurtwood's performance in the short film 12:01." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "(Minor spoilers ahead) This movie is a major example of a film that works on almost all levels (but it is not for the squeamish). It works as pure entertainment, a reflection of society when capitalism goes overboard, a thoughtful look into the emotional torment of a man who's had everything taken from him, and a brutal, unforgiving bad ass revenge tale! And boy is that dish served cold! Sometime in the future, Detroit is overrun by vicious criminals. Drugs, prostitution, murder, and injustice are commonplace. Meanwhile, the city is taken over by the suits at OCP, a consumer products mega corporation that manufactures everything from basic consumer items to military weapons and robotics. They've also bought out local law enforcement, leaving many cops at the picket lines since the city owes the company $37 million after a bail out. OCP also secretly works with the city's most dangerous criminals when need be (for something to gain) and are about as corrupt as can be. Seeing as how crime is so rampant and out of control, OCP JR.CEO Dick Jones offers up big bad ED 209, a law enforcement droid who ends up making a bloody mess out of their own at a board meeting in the most extreme bullet ridden kind of way! Upcommer in the biz, Bob Morton sees this as his opportunity to go straight to the head CEO to upstage the seemingly corrupt Dick Jones. Enter Alex Murphy, a good man and heroic cop new to the Detroit metro south police force. Along with his new tough but warmhearted partner Anne Lewis, they are radioed in to go after Clarence Bodicker, one evil and messed criminal and his gang of psychopaths. These guys are some of the most straight up cruel, violet, savage, and vicious villains I've seen on film. After an exhilarating chase, Murphy is tortured, humiliated, and left for dead by the villains. Murphy is later rebuilt by OCP as Robocop. As Robocop he becomes an unstoppable warrior of justice handing out brutality to the brutal and protecting those who cant protect themselves. He slowly starts to regain his memories and goes after the scum who coldly and mercilessly killed him. Usually in movies when a villain brutally harms or kills our protagonist, the vengeance is not often as brutal or satisfactory. This is not the case! The revenge is cold as ice! But Clarence and his thugs are not the only ones. Murphy finds there is more going on behind the scenes then he expected. Can he stop it? How much of him is human and how far can he go? There are few movies I've loved just as much as a kid as I now love as an adult. This is one of the few. It is an incredible film, satisfying on so many levels. Don't let the goofy title or terrible 2014 remake fool you. This is the real deal. Awesome action, great story, and good old fashioned 1980s special effects that look real and not computer generated. Give it a look. You will not be disappointed! Just watch out for that toxic waste, melting scene in the climax. It is disturbing! So if quality action/SciFi cinema is your thing (or not), check this out and enjoy! \"YOUR MOVE, CREEP\"."

"\"B&@$es leave!!\" I direct that sentiment towards anyone out there who thinks the remake of Robocop can hold a candle to Paul Verhoeven's brilliant, incredibly graphic and bitingly satirical 1987 classic. Everything that was special and amazing about the original was absolutely urinated on with the remake, and it kills me that I run into people my age these days who aren't even aware that the remake IS a remake, and think it's the original Robocop. Ugh. Get out. No, this is the real, steel deal, accented by Verhoeven's blunt approach to characterization and overly ultraviolent, near Cronenberg-esque flair for carnage. Peter Weller only gets to act as regular joe police officer Alex Murphy for a brief and chaotic prologue, but makes the most of it with his deadpan delivery and piercing gaze. Murphy is assigned to a precinct in the heart of Old Detroit, a district so corrupt, rotten and infested with crime it literally resembles a war zone, and cops wear heavy riot gear on their beat. Paired Nancy Allen, he beelines it for a suspicious truck leaving the scene of a heist. Only one problem: this particular truck happens to belong to evil arch criminal Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith) and his merry band of psychopaths, who are armed to the teeth with heavy artillery. Cornered in a warehouse, Murphy is brutally, and I mean freaking brutally dispatched by Boddicker and his gang, shredded by a hail of gunfire that turns him into raw hamburger meat. What's left of him is quickly swooped up by corporate, and used in a high tech, absolutely silly program run by coked up suited opportunist Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer). His idea has gotten in the way of nefarious plans put in motion by the top dog of the company, a maniac named Dick Jones played by Ronny Cox in a frighteningly funny turn that makes you terrified in between fits of giggles. Once Murphy has been through Morton's wringer, Robocop emerges, an epic, unstoppable android enforcer who lays waste to criminal scum all over town, until traces of Murphy's consciousness bubble up past the circuit boards and he gets his own agenda. Jones is determind to take him down, along with Morton, undermining The Old Man (Daniel O'Herlihy), the acting CEO. For a film called Robocop that came out in 1987 you'd think were in for a cut and dry action cheese fest. Not with Verhoeven at the helm. The Dutch madman is never one to play it safe (a refreshing trait among European directors) and pulls out all the stops here for a bloody good time that pauses ever so slightly to nudge you with its cynical side that just loves to bash social convention into oblivion. The effects are so 80's you'll swoon, especially when Jones's own robo creation shows up in clanking, drunken stop motion that you can practically reach out and touch. Smith is a homicidal wonder as Boddicker, the smarmy fury and unrestrained behaviour hijacking every scene he's in. Leland Palmer himself, Ray Wise plays Leon Nash, his equally dastardly second in command, and a host of gnarly character actors back them up, all of which have curiously guest starred on Fox's 24 at various points in time, including Weller too. The level of f&@cks given with this film goes into the negative region of the thermometer, and to this day few studio films have been able to boast such disregard for discretion or lay claim to a sheer love of bombastic villains, a blatant lack of subtlety and a willingness to take things to cinematic infinity, beyond and back again just so they can throw a few more bullets into the mix. Accept no substitutes." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Robocop was released in 1987 starring Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, Kurtwood Smith and Ronny Cox. Just like the original Terminator movie this is an amazing movie full of gore and great violence that works in favor of the movie but also a really good script and unique movie for that time Weller as Alex Murphy A.k.a Robocop is really great and totally fits the part but also Kurtwood Smith as Boddiker he's amazing a really great villain and of course Ronny Cox as Dick Jones the actor was meant to play another villain 3 years after this movie was released in Total Recall (1990) directed by Paul Verhoven the director of this movie. The only problem i had with the movie is that in my opinion it's pretty short i wanted more violence and much more action but i'm OK with that and also the ED-209 which is a stop motion when it falls from the stairs it's kinda cheesy. Another great thing about this film is the soundtrack by Basilis Pouledouris which i think is amazing especially when the cops start shooting Murphy that was pretty hard to watch because you feel what the character has been threw loosing his wife, his son, his job but also his humanity. Just like Predator which also came out in 1987 the sequels weren't that awesome but i did liked the Remake it didn't try to copy the movie it was setting a new story and that is what i loved from it. In the end Robocop is easily one of the best movies ever made but also a great action science fiction movie that worked thanks to a talented director, great cast, amazing soundtrack and a very unique script for the time but also for it's R-Rating. P.S: The Trailer for the movie Robocop actually borrowed the theme of The Terminator (1984) and for some reason that was awesome!!!" "\"Robocop\" is a modern science fiction masterpiece. The future is not black and white, as most sci-fi tales conform to. It is a utopia of white-teeth propaganda but its black tarred heart beats a dystopian horror. \"Robocop\" has been misunderstood simply as an eighties violent action picture. It is a lot more than that. Peter Weller is an inspired choice for the dual role of Officer Murphy (married family man, nice suburban home) and his resurrected entity - Robocop. The armor suit is brilliantly created, and seems well ahead of its time - example the gun holster in his leg (this is pre-CGI). Nancy Allen, plays his side-kick who also holds a high moral compass. The story is simple, and therein lies its beauty. Paul Verhoeven is a master at creating visceral Science Fiction worlds brimming with originality, extreme violence, and sharp satirical humor. RoboCop is the perfect example. It is often hilarious, and equally thrilling. The violence is played up to an unrealistic level, making it difficult to take seriously (as you should not), yet even so, it may be a little much for the squeamish. The violence may have been a shocker back then, but by today's standards it's pretty standard, so I feel the over-the-top tone may go over some newer viewers' heads. Overall rating: 9 out of 10." "If a film can be considered perfect based on the presidents that it personally sets out to accomplish and it's achievement of doing so effortlessly, then the original Robocop might be as close to a perfect film as it gets! It knows that it want's to be an over-the-top, comically violent sci-fi action movie with a ridiculous premise, while simultaneously making fun of contemporary American consumerism in the 1980's. And it hits it's mark with precision only Robocop himself could have! The movie provides you with almost no wasted screen time; every scene serves its purpose in developing the story! Even when the action and the plot is interrupted by \"Media Breaks\" and hilarious satirical commercials, it doesn't waste your time and keeps you entertained and immersed in this dystopian view of Detroit. And while the movie is hard to take seriously based on the name and premise alone, it doesn't shy away from providing some very real human moments and deep emotions. The tone of the movie is all over the place, but the tone of each scene is never out of place, and it all seems to fit together. However, be forewarned before going into this film that this movie is excessively violent. It's not violent from start to finish necessarily, but there are scenes of people being shot 60 times in the chest with heavy weapons and a guy who's flesh melts after being drenched in toxic waste (which is arguable the funniest part of the movie). The violence can be a bit much at times, especially when we see the main protagonist brutally tortured with shotguns by a gang of criminals, but most of the scenes are so over-the-top that they become absurd and outright comical! Bottom line: this film earns it's R rating several times over, so be prepared! If you can stomach the ridiculous violence and gore, and can accept this film as what it is, then you will definitely enjoy Robocop! Just know what kind of movie you're getting into first." "This film is comparable to a fine wine or cheese. It gets better the more and more it ages. Robocop is Paul Verhoeven's greatest film (Close second Total Recall) of which both had terrible remakes. If you have not already seen Robocop I highly suggest it if you are a fan of either Total Recall or any good 80s violence fest, such as The Thing. It is no surprise that the ED-209 and Robocop are two icons of pop culture. Not the greatest film ever made, perfect at what it wants to do. Which is a violent crime action film with sci-fi elements. One of the best films to come out of the 80s." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This is a fun film, in the vein of classics like 'The terminator' and 'Total recall', though not that good. The story has some pretty good ideas in it, there's a lot of creative violence and gadgets, and the two leads, Peter Weller and Nancy Allen, really work well together. There's a good load of fun bad guys here as well, one of whom is Kurtwood 'foot in your ass' Smith. At times there are some lesser scenes, for instance, when that gang gets together shooting the really big guns just for fun - they're more like a bunch of kids there. But every time things are about to get a little too boring or too silly, things pick up pretty quick again. The stop-motion parts are a lot of fun as well, as is the (in itself somewhat off-handed) part with the toxic waste crash. As said, the story has some good ideas, but as a whole it wasn't all too convincing. Just a fun '80s sci-fi action ride, that's all - and that's fine! A good 7 out of 10." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Officer Alex Murphy is killed in the line of duty and then re-built by the \"Omni-Consumer-Products\" Corporation as robocop. Part man, Part machine, All Cop. Although released in 1987 it is set in an unspecified future. This movie is chock full of satire about 1980's culture and it has aged very well in my opinion. Sadly many of the attitudes displayed by some of the characters in this film have become true. Highly recommended. This original is much better than the 2014 \"Re-make\". I would have typed everything correctly but IMDb wouldn't allow it. They thought I was yelling. Go figure." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "I have to say, this was a pretty good movie, it wouldn't be a favorite but man, Robocop was a bad ass! I honestly wish I could have a suit like that so I can not worry about being shot by criminals but unfortunately, it's not real so I might as well suck it up to reality! I actually never came across this movie but I have heard of it throughout the years! I probably was the only person in the world to not have seen this since it has been proved quite popular! I was kinda bummed to hear that they made more abaptions to this like the sequel and rebooted this in 2014. I won't be planning to look at them but still, I was annoyed that Hollywood decided to kill the original movie! So yup, I loved the action and of course be aware of the blood or gore in this!" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Detroit police officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is critically wounded in the line of duty. A corporation struggling with public image bends its resources toward remaking Officer Murphy into a superhuman, cybernetic police officer. Robocop then proceeds to wear anal orifices for socks as he struggles with his humanity. In all, this movie is outstanding from a technical point of view. Nothing really failed and most of the technical aspects of film making succeeded beautifully for the time with the only hiccups being in the acting department. This is one of the rare examples of everything coming together just right in a product that is by no means Oscar-worthy. Personally I love this movie for its writing. It flows nicely with no ponderous slow spots and it packs so much into a relatively short time, from humanist themes to 1980s culture parody to criticizing corporatism and the whole time, delivering a narrative that is far from preachy and keeps you entertained. Movies just aren't written like this anymore. Granted, the plot is a bit campy, even for the 80s, but it was done very well. I would highly recommend this movie to watch because it is a good movie on technical merit, if you keep the time it was made in mind (which to me, is the only fair way to judge film)." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "RoboCop (1987): Dir: Paul Verhoeven / Cast: Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, Kurtwood Smith, Ronny Cox, Dan O'Herlihy: Overrated yet innovative action film about advance technology. Officer Murphy is shot to death but revived as partial robot to stop crime in Detroit but past memories soon surface causing him to pursue those who took his life. Well established plot becomes routine catering to a graphic action climax. Directed by Paul Verhoeven as his first major hit. He previously made the cult film Soldier of Orange. A big technical achievement with Peter Weller portraying the overwhelming crime stopping Robocop. Weller plays off a sense of loss and a sense of curiosity as he struggles to adapt to his new life. He soon realizes real benefits when it comes to dealing with crime. Nancy Allen as his partner is basically a cardboard female lead. Kurtwood Smith plays a convincing villain who actually is responsible for nearly dismantling Robocop when he and his gang shoot him up until he is able to find cover. Ronny Cox plays the standard issue villain whose defeat is less climatic than intended. Dan O'Herlihy plays a character called \"the old man\" perhaps because they are attempting to remind him that he has gray hair. While story is somewhat standard fare, Verhoeven does present a new kind of action hero. It demonstrates the possibilities and disadvantages of technology.

"I hadn't seen this movie in a hundred years, well since the 80's anyway but I'd always remembered that it was a good movie. I caught it again on TV the other night and went in expecting an absolute 80's cheesefest; with bad special effects and satirical bad guys but I was pleasantly surprised, this is still a good movie. Yes it is a bit dated now in terms of special effects and the super cool opening graphics but not as much as I was expecting and in terms of when this was made, its pretty brilliant. Lots of clever ideas, with an intelligent story disguised somewhat by action, gore and dark satire. Peter Weller does a fantastic job as Officer Alex Murphy, a Detroit police officer who is killed in the line of duty and then resurrected as a half human-half robot programed to serve justice at any cost -a quest that is often at odds with his thirst for revenge against the thugs that killed him. Weller manages to express a lot of emotion from under his mask and must have really worked on getting the robotic body language down, the jerkiness. I wound up feeling really sorry for his character. Lots of familiar faces amongst the business men and bad guys with Clarence Boddicker standing out as the perfect baddie, trying to kill 'Murphy (again). He spouts my favourite line from the movie upon entering Miguel Ferrer's cocaine party \"bitches leave\". There are also some funny ads (the Nuke-Em game) and ironic futuristic news clips. A movie worth checking out again, its stood the test of time. 6/23/15" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "The original Robocop is a film that I've seen several times now and no matter how many times I watch it it's a film that never loses its appeal with me. Anyone who is familiar with Verhoeven's work will know that he has a love for two things; satire and blood shed and with Robocop we get plenty of both. Robocop is also rife with swipes at capitalism and corporate greed (you can well imagine large corporations wasting huge amounts of money on a failed project and continually refusing to believe that said failed project is a waste of time). This kind of acts as a running theme in the background. I think what really sets Robocop apart from many science fiction/action films is that it has a heart and is also intelligent. In the wrong hands this could have been just a mindless shoot em up (which would have been fine, but it wouldn't have made it particularly memorable). It's also a film that has a lot of heart; Murphy is a likable family man, a nice guy and therefore I found the scenes when he's starting to reform his memories to be particularly moving. These flashbacks and memories help to flesh out Murphy's character and ultimately give us enough of a vested interest to care about his character and the story in general. Are there any problems with this film? Yes only a couple of minor ones though; the ED209 robot effects are clunky and fairly laughable now, but we have to remember that this was made back in 1987 and SFX move on very quickly. I also found it hard to understand why Dick Jones would put a directive 4 in place to stop Robocop arresting him, but didn't put one in to stop Robocop arresting Boddicker or any of his cronies? I mean that is effectively what brought Jones' entire operation down? Having said that these are minor niggles more than anything and despite these minor problems Robocop is still an excellent film. It's violent, it's bloody, but it's also intelligent and strangely for a sci-fi/action film it actually has a bit of heart as well. A wonderful film that has clearly stood the test of time and one that still holds up well following repeat viewings." "Poetic, Nasty, Smooth, Ultra-Sleek, Witty, Bloody, Violent, Rich, Cutting-Edge Action Satire that was a Huge Hit with Both Critics and Audiences. Rarely Such Diversified Elements Come Together So Well as in This Reagan-Era, Corporate, Fascist, In-Your-Face Take on So Many of the Era's Iconic and Social Concerns. Nothing Falls Short in this Over the Top Sci-Fi Crime Movie. Things Mesh, Like Peter Weller's Sympathetic Portrayal of Murphy/RoboCop and the Villainous Gang Headed by Kurtwood Smith as Bodicker, An Evil Leader of the Thugs and Partner to Big-Corp. This Sadistic, Heinous Bad-Guy is Just One More Spot-On Element in this Sleeper/Winner that Remains as Entertaining and Pertinent Today as the Year it was Released. That's the Definition of a Classic. The SFX of ED-209 Done in Stop-Motion May Look a Bit Clunky Compared with the Slick CGI of Today, but it is Well Done and Adds a Surreal Tone to the Scenes and the Bipedal Robot Can Still Captivate the Screen. On the Human Side, Miguel Ferrer, Nancy Allan (in Her best performance), and the Supporting Cast are All Outstanding from Top to Bottom (on both sides of the Law). Overall, Social Satire Sci-Fi Doesn't Get Any Better than this. Director Verhoeven's Starship Troopers (1997) Comes Close, but This One, Set in a Crumbling American City that Today is a Crumbling American City, is More Up Close and Personal and the Focus is Sharp and Cartoons its Way Into the Annals of Great Pop Culture." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This sci-fi movie still holds up well today. It goes straight to the action. I am amazed that Peter Weller's Robocop can express so much emotion under the mask. In fact, even his walk and movements are very expressive. Miguel Ferrer's role as the ambitious businessman was great. You could feel his desperation. Clarence Boddicker's villainous role is pitch perfect. He plays a crime boss who enjoys wreaking havoc and who killed Peter Weller's character. It is also good that Robocop also highlights some interesting predictions such as an invasion to other countries, and the rise of corporations. In short, this movie succeeds because it is able to balance drama with action without getting too mushy. On the other hand, it knows what it is: an action movie with great shooting." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "In a dystopic and crime-ridden Detroit, a terminally wounded cop returns to the force as a powerful cyborg haunted by submerged memories. Detroit - in the future - is crime-ridden, and run by a massive company. The company have developed a huge crime-fighting robot, which unfortunately develops a rather dangerous glitch. The company sees a way to get back in favor with the public when a cop called Alex Murphy is killed by a street gang. Murphy's body is reconstructed within a steel shell and named RoboCop. The RoboCop is very successful against criminals, and becomes a target of supervillain Boddicker. Roger Ebert wrote \"Most thriller and special-effects movies come right off the assembly line. You can call out every development in advance, and usually be right. \"RoboCop\" is a thriller with a difference.\" RoboCop is not just your run of the mill sci-fi/thriller film or whatever, it is quite a poignant and moving film too." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Professor Weller is spectacular in his portrayal of Murphy. The supporting cast members are all on the same story-page and perform to a 'T'. The movie is directed flawlessly, Paul Verhoeven did a very commendable job with this venture. There is a perfect-paced tempo married with enough suspense laced humor that chuckling and cringing are common place. This thing is enjoyable from beginning to end. For this movie, I had a lot of funthe only flaw I noticed was what happened after this production. Why did they whip up a \"Robocop\" franchise? Why did some knucklehead insist on making sequels? Come on, with sequels gradually sucking worse than their predecessors, the writing should have been on the wall  and I only wish they took the hint and had left well enough alone. Anyways  the movie is awesome and I highly recommend it" "I had not seen it for year, s I don't remember it being as gory back then but I was really surprise as the gory it was, I did not expect that at all. That is one of reason why I really enjoyed the movie, thought it was really well made, a lot of action in the movie that blends in with the drama. There few one-liners to make you laugh, here and there and I think the effects for time was really good. the acting was great from the cast 7 out of 10" "\"Your move, creep.\" Robocop is one of those movies I watched as a kid when I probably shouldn't have, but i'm glad I did. It's consistently as dramatic as it is funny and satirical, making it a really unique film. It has a lot to say about corporations and the government, and what it has to say is relevant even today. Plus it's amazingly 80's feeling, and you gotta love that. The plot of this film comes across as very cheesy. A cop who is killed in action is brought back as a robotic cop. And it is very cheesy. But somehow, the film makes you care about what happens. Perhaps it has to do with Peter Weller's great performance. I feel like it's a pretty underrated performance, because people don't realize how much thought went into the way Robocop moves around. Weller just does it so well. There's also a good amount of practical effects here, such as the blood and gore, and even some stop motion stuff. It's always great to see practical effects rather then the mass amounts of CGI that we see today. Overall, Robocop is a great movie. It's essentially a really well made B-movie, but that's kinda what makes it great. It's highly quotable and lots of fun. Watch it." "The eighties birthed dozens of iconic characters and one of the coolest, in my opinion, has always been RoboCop. Half-man, half-machine. The coolest cop in Old Detroit. More than 20 years later, he's still one of the most awesome action heroes to come out of the era, and the film still holds up today. I lament the fact that there is a new generation whose first exposure to the character might be the toothless 2014 reboot. The original is a far superior film with wit, brutality, and a myriad of memorable moments that stick with you long after the movie's over. From director Paul Verhoeven, ROBOCOP is the story of Alex Murphy (Peter Weller). Murphy is a recent transfer and his first time out in his new precinct ends with local kingpin Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith) and his cronies filling him with more shotgun slugs than one would think humanly possible. Meanwhile, the conglomerate OCP is in need of a \"volunteer\" for their new RoboCop program when their unmanned police robot, the ED-209, displays some hazardous glitches. Murphy is rebuilt as the now legendary RoboCop and immediately begins cleaning the streets of Old Detroit. As the population goes wild for their new law enforcement hero, sinister forces conspire to terminate his program. Boddicker learns that Murphy survived their encounter and wants to tie up his loose ends, and OCP senior president Dick Jones (Ronny Cox) resents that RoboCop overshadowed his own ED-209 program and worries that RoboCop might pose a threat to his underworld ties. Where to begin? I love this movie. The premise, when viewed subjectively, is pretty cheesy: a half-man, half-machine superhuman police officer. But it's just handled so perfectly. It never takes itself too seriously, coming at the audience with a wink and a smile that helps soften the blow of the gratuitous violence. It opens with a news clip where overly-enthusiastic broadcasters deliver news of violence in South Africa with the same dopey smile that they'd deliver celebrity gossip, and the citizens are obsessed with a cheesy, breast-filled sitcom that gave us one of the most quotable lines in the movie (\"I'd buy that for a dollar!\"). Meanwhile, Old Detroit's in shambles with gang violence running rampant. Really, the movie was pretty accurate in it's predictions on what the future of America might look like. We may not be at the dystopian level of the movie yet, but we're close with our TV- obsessed culture and the privatization of the police force a possible reality in the not-too-distant future. ROBOCOP takes what could've been a lazy B-grade action schlock film and turns it into a social commentary. Who would've thought it with a name like ROBOCOP? The movie's got an undercurrent of humor running throughout and has its share of laughs from the sheer absurdity at times. As refreshing as the satire and humor are, it never overshadows the action and ROBOCOP is a shining example of how much Verhoeven loves some brutal violence in his movies. Just as was the case with Brett's death scene in ALIEN, one ROBOCOP scene in particular had haunted me since childhood and was the sole reason it took me a while to revisit the film. I was pretty young at the time and I can't even remember how I came to watch it. I remember the initial boardroom scene with the ED-209 blew my mind but it was until the end of the movie where it got to be a little much when Boddicker's henchman Emil (Paul McCrane) saw his end. That scene cemented itself in my young mind because of just how much it freaked me out. I won't spoil it here for anyone who hasn't seen the movie, but it's probably one of the coolest parts. Despite the horror of the scene sending me running at the time, the image of RoboCop, the character, stuck with me and he was always one of my favorite characters, even though I hadn't the nerve to even finish the movie. Having gone back and revisited the movie in later years, it's no surprise why. RoboCop is just awesome. I love the character design (that new stealth black model of the 2014 is garbage in comparisonlike some sort of an anthropomorphic iPhone) and his stone-cold robotic stoicism. He was like some sort of futuristic Western hero, stomping into town, twirling his gun, and confronting the baddies. As I grew older, I came to realize just how awesome all the performances in the film were (not just the Robo-variety). Kurtwood Smith, who for the longest time I'd only known as the dad from \"That 70's Show\", is a perfect villain! I guess it shouldn't have surprised me but he's bizarrely charismatic for a psychopath. Nancy Allen, Ronny Cox, Miguel Ferrer they're all rock solid in the film. The ROBOCOP franchise might not've seen as much success as I'd want after the mind-blowingly awesome original, but the first film is still a classic piece of action. I was hoping the reboot might pick up where the original left off and build on it but, instead, it's made it apparent that a movie like Verhoeven's ROBOCOP probably wouldn't get made in modern times and I doubt we'll ever see anything that'll stand up to its strength. It has aged amazingly well and it's just as good as it was more than 20 years ago and, if you've gone this long without watching the original 1987 ROBOCOP, you owe it to yourself to give it a shot." "\"Robocop\" is underrated , misunderstood and ingenious classic action science fiction movie. It's full of excess , black humor and satire. There's more here than meets the eye. On the surface it's just a B-class movie , but it exceeds expectations as one of the smartest science fiction movies ever made. The writers were inspired by many sources  \"Wizard of Oz\" , \"Frankenstein\" ,\"Blade runner\" , \"Terminator\" , comic books (Iron man and Judge Dredd) sci-fi stories of William Gibson and even a little bit of western is here. Robocop's three Prime Directives are reminiscent of the Three Laws of Robotics as devised by sci-fi author Isaac Asimov . We have here Brixby Snyder, a parody of Benny Hill whose running line is \"I'd buy that for a dollar\" . There is some subtle Christ imagery here. Verhoeven has stated that he sees the character as a futuristic version of Christ. \"Robocop\" is highly entertaining action movie with heroes for whom you can root and villains who are deliciously evil. Paul Verhoeven's direction is superb. The ultra-violence is so over-the-top that it's not really shocking to look at but almost more comical like because it's just so cartoonish. The action scenes are well staged , fast paced and the mix of live action with stop motion effects works wonderfully. His biggest accomplishment is however the fact that the movie really tugs at viewer's heartstrings. Verhoeven really makes you care about his hero and the movie is full of haunting sadness . The movie has a lot of heart and feels almost like an Greek tragedy. It's not that far from \"Blade runner\" in asking question what it means to be human. The well written screenplay presents a cynical view of future. Money driven society , over-commercialized future , corporate greed , dehumanization of almost everyone  it's all here. The vision of future in \"Robocop\" is really scary , because if you look at the world today you will notice how accurate the movie satire is. Political prostitution , big companies which control almost every part of our existence , criminals everywhere from street thugs to business execs , society dominated by technology  it's all already happening now. \"Robocop\" is a brilliant portrayal of 80's America that is even more relevant today. Wicked , witty , razor sharp script provides a MANY BIG LAUGHS and at the same time is thought provoking. Themes that appear in this movie are : man vs. self , man vs. man , man vs. technology , man vs. society , man vs. fate , identity, humanity , transition , capitalism , technology , privatization. There is uplifting message here that sounds honest  human element will ALWAYS rise in some kind of form. Some brilliant and memorable ideas include series of first-person perspectives , several fake advertisements (The Family Heart Center, Nukem,6000 SUX ) and the climactic \"Melting Man\" scene. There are some awe inspiring design's  Robocop's suit , Robocop's handgun , ED 209. And who could forget such great one liners like \"Dead or alive , your coming with me\" or \"Your move creep\". Acting is a very strong point of this movie. Peter Weller does wonders in the role of Robo. His cold voice , mechanical movements and the whole spectrum of emotions he is able to show only with his jaw.. A truly great performance. Kurtwood Smith shines as the Clarence Bodicker  heartless ,sadistic , Himmler like criminal. The supporting cast is also more than solid  Nancy Allen (Lewis) , Ronny Cox (Dick Jones) , Miguel Ferrer (Bob Morton) and others. Memorable and likable characters that are well played  what more do you need ? Interesting thing  Arnold Schwarzenegger and Rutger Hauer were considered for the role of Robocop. The technical aspects stood the test of time. Movie was rightfully Oscar nominated for best editing and best sound . The half-orchestra , half-synthesizer score by Basil Poleudoris is both heroic and tragic. \"Robocop theme\" is just outstanding. Jost Vocano provides the movie with some great photography. The effects vary from the magnificent to the slightly shoddy , but considering the low budget (only 13 million ) I'm amazed how REALLY well this movie looks. Brilliant , smart and highly entertaining classic from the 80's. I give it 9/10."

"Just watched this again for the first time since the 90's. Simple comic book storyline about a dead cop reclaimed by a big Corporation and converted into a crime fighting cyborg. Extremely violent in places with gory details, the robot effects are entertaining as are the moments of satire throughout the film. There isn't too much more to say about it, Robocop is about cheap thrills for those who enjoy violent movies laced with satire. From what I remember Robocop 2 was decent as well and there is a new Robocop movie but according to Mark Kermode the original is still the best." "A fun concept: In a dystopic and crime-ridden Detroit, a terminally wounded cop returns to the force as a powerful cyborg haunted by submerged memories. It's definitely not the thing to see if you're in the mood for something fun and uplifting, or something with tons of thrills and action. The metaphors in this movie are so abundant. The director likes to show certain things: scenes that might not be a part of the story, but add much to the story in general, the way a writer might prelude a chapter by describing something connected to, but not in line with the characters. Unfairly dismissed by some as confusing. 7/10." "There's quite a bit of fairly funny satire in ROBOCOP, which is one of the things that makes it well worth watching- at least once. The biggest irony, I suppose, is that a lot of what was satirical back in 1987 is nowadays taken for granted as \"just the way things are.\" We've come along way, I guess... Peter Weller gives a solid performance as Murphy and this is arguably Verhoeven's finest film to date, but it was the fx that made this one a must-see when it first hit town. The makeup fx are over-the-top funny (my favorite is the villain who gets soaked with toxic waste and begins melting) and the ED209 was so cool that I kept an action figure of it for years. That's not to downplay the players: everybody in this one is playing it to the hilt, especially Ronnie Cox and Miguel Ferrar; you can hardly wait to see them get THEIRS... It's interesting to go back and look at movies like ROBOCOP decades later and find that some of them still hold up. (I've always wondered if the makers of ROBOCOP were familiar with Jack Kirby's MACHINE MAN: he and Murphy have a great deal in common.)" "This is an action-packed supercop film set in the future in Detroit, a city plagued by crime and whose police department has been bought off by Omni Consumer Products (OCP). After Officer Alex Murphy is killed by a street gang, the company retrieves his body and reconstructs him into a cyborg named RoboCop, who becomes the criminals' greatest adversary. Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner wrote a clever and captivating story for this film and I thought Paul Verhoeven did a good job in the direction, keeping the movie exciting and fast-paced and assembling a dynamic cast of characters. Peter Weller did a great job portraying RoboCop, acting like a superhero as he fights off criminals and inserting drama and emotion into the character that makes the cyborg element more intriguing, especially in the part where RoboCop's human memories of his family and of his demise slowly return to him. His personality and one-liners remind me of Arnold Scharzenegger's Terminator role at times. Nancy Allen gave a warm portrayal of RoboCop's partner-in-crime, Anne Lewis, giving it her all in what is probably her most recognizable roles. Rounding off the cast of characters are the group of ruthless and nasty villains headed by Clarence J. Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith) you would love to root against and headed by Dick Jones, played by Ronny Cox from the Beverley Hills Cop movies. The special effects were pretty good for the most part, although some of the robot scenes were a little too shaky and unrealistic. Some of the acting was also a bit off, reminding you of very 80s cliché dialog. But overall, it's one of the better sci-fi action movies of the 1980s and is throughly entertaining. Grade B" "Probably regarded as Paul Verhoeven's first big directorial debut, Robocop is one of the iconic 1980s film characters, up there with Batman and the Terminator. Even today, the 1987 film still stands up to any scrutiny. Alex Murphy (played by Peter Weller, a man with killer cheekbones) husband and father, is a cop relocated to Detroit's struggling police department in a time of high crime and corporate greed. Clarence Boddicker, a crime boss who works with impunity, and a company CEO look to place military grade robots in cities to replace the degraded police force and take control. However when on assignment, Murphy is maliciously gunned down and killed by Boddicker's men, only for a rival corporation to revive him as an autonomous servant of justice. But is there anything left of Murphy's humanity left? It is easy to forget, twenty-seven years down the line, how bloody and violent Robocop really is, and it doesn't hold back. Murphy's horrific murder occurs in the film's first act and mentally scarred a generation for good reason! But I don't want you to get the wrong impression, I love the film's dedication to using ridiculous amounts of blood squibs and physical stunts. This is what the late 80s were best at, the action in this film is simple but wonderfully executed. The Robocop himself is cumbersome, he walks and moves with deliberately jerky motions, but when the action starts, he is an unstoppable force. I could get side-tracked and go on about the action, ED-209 and all, but what's nice about the film is its more subtle story telling with its characters. Very little is told about Murphy before his death, just enough to get us to understand quite how much has been lost. It is a story of the corporate desire to replace human beings with computers, only here it is literal. Murphy is dead, his body is completely mechanised, his family left, there's nothing for him to hold on to yet his humanity lingers and tries to recover within the bonds of corporate designs. Possibly Paul Verhoeven's best work, it is a simple concept now but it still strikes a cord even in today's world. It has the director's signature satire and humour throughout, and not-so-subtle messages of greed and corporate take overs (got to love those TV adverts, one for a board game called \"Nukem\", were you dictate nuclear war on other nations) If you haven't seen Robocop, what are you doing with your life? Sure some of the composite special effects with the monstrous ED-209 have dated, but it is a solid action movie (and let's not forget in this day and age, an original movie) and it demands your attention." "What can one say about Robocop, the 1987 Verhoeven classic, that hasn't already been said before? A true delight of both visual filmmaking and action driven storytelling. At it's most basic one would describe Robocop as a slick action thriller but under the surface lurks a deeply thought provoking take on Mary Shelly's Victorian classic, Frankenstein and what it is that makes us human? What it is that defines our humanity? No one could ever accuse the story of Robocop of being new, the themes it explores are themes that have been explored and regurgitated in every art form throughout our history, every generation has asked these same questions. The true beauty of Robocop is not in it's originality but in the way Verhoeven makes us look at a familiar tale through new eyes, we the viewer are invited to look at humanity through Robocop's eyes, to see what he sees, to get a glimpse of what it is he thinks and to see what it is specifically that drives his character on in eventually discovering his own humanity. Verhoeven and Neumeier make no allusion to the fact that Robocop is inspired by comic book characters like Judge Dredd and Rom the Space Knight, but unlike the aforementioned Judge Dredd, who's own film in 1995 can only be described as an abortion of filmmaking, Verhoeven and Neumeier are able to successfully and faithfully portray the core concepts of these titular characters on the big screen, whilst retaining a genuine uniqueness and provoking perspective. Even when taking off one's rose tinted glasses, deep fried in greasy cinematic nostalgia, it is obvious that Robocop is a masterpiece of filmmaking that holds up even to this day. Yes some of the effects have aged, most notably the stop-motion animation that brings the ED-209 to life, and some of the dialogue is definitely stuck in the 80's, yet neither of these things can detract from what is otherwise a stellar film. Some have criticized the film for it's over the top action and gore but I find rather than taking your attention away from the central themes of the narrative, the action and gore instead add to it. No action scene in the film is pointless and dragged into the murky waters of style over substance, instead each action scene is central to the film and helps to progress the story forward towards it's blockbuster ending. Modern action filmmakers in the mold of Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich should take note of how it should be done. Perhaps the part of this film that is the most impressive is Peter Weller's performance as the title character, his ability to convey a character who is more machine than man through his movements is at times truly spectacular, such is his ability as an actor, we the audience truly buy him as a robotic law enforcement officer, truly pragmatic in his work, yet at the same time he portrays's a man, a man with weaknesses and doubts, a man capable of love and all the other emotions on the human spectrum. This subtle conveyance of emotion, the tiny facial movements that play across Weller's face, even though we can only see a portion of him is the beauty of Robocop. But perhaps the true genius of Robocop, the holy trinity that makes this film the masterpiece it is, is the titanic culmination of Peter Weller's performance, Verhoeven's direction and Neumeier's writing. Truly these three ingredients are what makes Robocop the classic it is. To summarize Robocop is a surprisingly intelligent action/sci-fi flick that explores and satirizes American culture whilst also making the viewer question what it is to be human? If only they still made films of this caliber, we would truly be living in a true golden age of cinema." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "A brutally injured cop is given the chance to go on in law and enforcement by becoming half man, half machine. After he becomes Robocop he goes after the people who cost him his human life and caused him to be this machine. This film starred: Peter Weller, Nancy Allen & Dan O'Herlihy. Robocop is an enjoyable film, It is funny at some points because of the cringy 80's action films have these cringy scenes all of the time. I do recommend this film because it is a good action film with some funny scenes attached. It is also a good revenge film. ***/***** Good film." "In a dystopian Detroit not too far off from the real thing (1987 or today), the police force is run by a corporation called Omni Consumer Products (OCP). Police officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is savagely attacked by a gang of criminals and left for dead but is revived by OCP and turned into a cyborg super cop. Stylish, satirical, ultra-violent sci-fi action movie with ample doses of black humor. Paul Verhoeven's best film. The kind of movie that is easily dismissed but deserves more praise than it gets. Great action and effects but also solid performances from the cast and a very good script. Basil Pouledoris' score is one of the best of any '80s movie. A classic that gets better with repeated viewings." "Underrated is the truth. The subtle emotional plays between family, the psychological development and metamorphic change of the main character from beginning to the climax, far exceed the original, the changes being brought about by different means. Relevant upgrades using modern technology and well played and the use of set and design make the film an eye candy delight. The flow of the film, the composition to final cut is much smoother than the original. It is a far deeper RoboCop here, a multi layered play that moves effortlessly to the end. If the other movie hadn't existed and this was viewed as a stand alone film, with it's own merits, it would be a good film. The comparisons to the original film should be put aside, it is not a scene by scene remake like Psycho, Nikita, The Vanishing or other films ruined by a dull or sanitized ending. It is a great as a sci-fi future film in the tones of the Terminator, fresh and updated.... for now." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "As the technical prowess and political power of corporations have grown, so have the people's fear and suspicion of corporate governance. Robocop brings these issues to the fore. In an unknown time of anarchic crime, a large corporation intends to privatize the police force by installing bionic police officers throughout the city. Robocop, a resurrected police officer, is the first of this kind. He is a machine and yet retains some of his humanity. As the movie progresses, he gradually rediscovers this humanity until he overthrows his corporate makers, who, of course, are not interested in people's safety as much as profits. The movie is hopeful: Corporations can never eradicate human morality and free will. What makes Robocop great is its streamlined and to-the-point editing. The movie wastes nary a second. Every scene briefly illustrates a plot point or an action scene, and then moves on. The movie even ends at its climax, having no time for post-climatic sentiment and catharsis. Despite being thirty years old, the movie still feels fresh and futuristic, perhaps because it doesn't rely on special effects so much as hard metal and fiery explosions. Robocop is a classic. It brings up interesting issues that TV shows are still exploring (e.g., Continuum), all while being very entertaining."

"*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Well I wanted to see this movie for a couple of reasons - one being that I liked the idea of it and the other being that I enjoy the work of Paul Veerhoven as a director (for the most part). Many people seem to build this up as a sci-fi/action classic and I agree. Okay so the story - a rookie cop named Alex Murphy is in a Dystopian Detroit where crime is everywhere. On his first assignment he is blown apart by a Crime gang. Meanwhile a company named OCP is working on ways to make the city safer. One way is with a complete robot that malfunctions in the sense that even if the criminal complies he gets more holes in him than Swiss cheese while another project is to take the corpse of an existing cop and replace most of his body with mechanical parts. After Murphy awakes as RoboCop and he becomes a big success. The person who designed him gets assassinated by the guy who built the malfunctioning robot, named Richard Jones on the grounds of \"You went over my head! I wanted to do something like this!\". Then RoboCop finds out that he was once human and that the people who killed him still roam free and he tries to arrest or kill everyone responsible. Once that finally happens he realizes the Crime Boss works for Jones. Okay I just have to mention this before I talk about anything else. Why is it in Action movies the henchmen can't hit the hero if he was 2 feet in front of him. Now, they seem to hit RoboCop with a pistol okay but there is a scenario in this movie where four guys armed with high tech bazooka's couldn't hit A SEVEN FOOT TALL SLOW MOVING HALF ROBOT! I think that's a pretty easy target to spot and easier to shoot it. To be fair though that scene is hilarious. Now onto the stuff I liked. The emotion of the story. It might be a little bit cliff note but most of the science fiction movies of today rarely put in any emotion (there have been a few small exceptions like Serenity and Neill Blomkamp's work but that's all off the top of my head). It might be small but I liked it very much. And of course there's just so many times this movie goes over-the-top. Every death scene of a major villain is usually done in the most over the top way they can think of among other things like the commercials. The entertainment value in something like that for me just makes me like the movie a bit more for the charm of doing this. RoboCop is just simply 80's cheese. The special effects for it's time are actually pretty damn impressive, to an extent they still are to this day. The Sets are really good and there's just so much enjoyment to be had from just watching some over-the-top gory action but with surprisingly a but of heart. I will watch the sequels and the remake (although to be fair it looks more like a \"I'm just going to wait until DVD for this one\"). If you like Science fiction with an action edge then this is for you." "A true master piece of the action genre. Robocop's struggle between being man or machine really is interesting. The graphic nature of this movie feels like the 80's action movie it is. True those that are skeptical of blood probably won't enjoy some of the scenes, overall the story of a company putting man inside a machine for justice is worth seeing a few people shot. I also love Peter Welling's portraying of his character. From the loving husband to the robot to having to find himself, you can't help but root for him through the entire movie. He is like a superhero in a sense and watching the whole movie is sure to give you goosebumps. This is one movie no action movie fan should miss." "Now that the remake is inevitable this movie is simply one of the best sci-fi action of all time. When this movie came out in 1987 was extremely violent (now 26 years later still is very violent) the special effects was Awesome,the action amazing,the acting more than good and the music unforgettable. The movie was directed by Paul Verhoven and this movie was the star for another great sci fi movies he later make (Total Recall,Starship Troopers)so the movie was in the right hands since the beginning. The movie worth it to see again i personally recommended to see it in blu ray...Go besides Robocop and make justice!!!." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This is a very good movie and I am becoming to think that Verhoeven is a very intelligent director. The movie is a action movie but there are a few things that stand out and that is the character of Robocop - rather than simply being an emotionless killing machine, like the Terminator, it is a being struggling with its humanity and duty to serve. It also shows intelligence as it looks not only at its prime directives, but at a forth hidden directive. The story is based around a lot of things. It is set in the future where the signs of industrialisation are showing on the world and America is quickly disintegrating (gee, might even be now). What one must remember is that this is the first of a trilogy and more is unfolded in further movies. The giant in this world is Omni Consumer Products (OCP) and they are based in Detroit and have plans to create a new city. Unfortunately crime is running rampant in the city, led by the crime lord Clarance Bardiager, and the cops are fighting a loosing battle. OCP attempts to implement a new droid, ED-209, but is does not work, killing an executive in a board meeting. Vice President Dick Jones is pushing for the ED-209 unit, but a younger executive has an idea, Robo-cop. Alex Murphy, a recent transfer, is then seriously injured in a nasty altercation with Clarence Bardeger and his gang, and is rushed to hospital where he dies on the hospital table. His body is appropriated by OCP and he is turned into Robocop, the ultimate law enforcer. They believe that he is just a machine controlled by a human brain, but we slowly notice that he still has his personality and his memories. The first example of this is that when he is asked to list his directives, he gives the main three, and then searches and discovers a forth hidden one. This movie is a character study of Robocop set in the background I have described. It is a background of corporate struggles, escalating crime, and blackmail. As Robocop is becoming embroiled in the corporate struggles and lies, he is trying to rediscover his identity and convince himself that he is alive. We learn more about the Robocop units in the next movie, but in this one we simply see a man dedicated to enforcing the law. One person recognises him, and that is his former partner. Even though she only worked with Murphy for one day, she instantly recognised one of his mannerisms and realised that this Robocop was made from the remains of Murphy. As the movie progresses, Robocop slowly comes explore his memories and seeks to bring himself back to life. Everywhere he looks he sees the remnants of a dead Murphy: all except for his former partner, who recognises that Murphy has been resurrected in the form of a very strong Robocop (we know that he is not indestructible). The epiphany is when he gets his partner to adjust his targeting and his shoots the canisters of babyfood that he was being fed. He is not a baby, he is Alex Murphy. And for the rest of the movie he has his helmet removed. Also in this movie, the Old Man, the managing director of OCP, seems to be the good guy. The bad guy is VP Dick Johnson, who is consorting with criminals and manipulating things to give him more money and power. He wants the ED-209 to succeed because he knows that a faulty robot brings much more money to OCP than does a perfect Robocop. Unfortunately for Dick, Murphy blows away an ED-209 within two seconds (though his first encounter is not to crash hot, but then he was caught by surprise). I just love this movie, as one can see that I have been raving on about it for such a long time. There is a lot in this movie, but on top of that it is also very entertaining. I simply love Robocop." "RoboCop is considered one of the best action sci-fi films of the 1980s, a dark, satirical film from the Dutch master of sci-fi action Paul Verhoeven. In the future Detroit is a crime infested city with gangs running wild and the police struggling to cope, made even worst when a private company, Omni Consumer Products (OCP) buy the Detroit police force. OCP are looking for ways to make the police more effective by using robotic police enforcers and a middle level executive, Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer) proposes the RoboCop project. On the front line Alex Murphy (Paul Weller) is a police officer transferred to central Detroit, the most dangerous precinct in the area. When he gets fatally and brutally shot on his first day of duty he becomes a prime candidate to become RoboCop, the ultimate law enforcer. But as RoboCop Alex starts to regain his memories and sets out to find his wife and son and find the men who destroyed his life. RoboCop is a gloriously violent film that Verhoeven is expert at providing this over the top style with limbs getting blown off and massive bullet holes blown into people. There are solid action sequences throughout, particularly the shoot outs and car chases. Verhoeven knows how to make it the action compelling, even though on the surface RoboCop seems invincible and character seeming physically slow. For the time RoboCop had excellent special effects, using physical effects like the costume and the charm of seeing stop motion effects. One of the key elements to why people love RoboCop is the comedy, dark humour and satire. This is mainly shown at the looks of the corporate world with a multi-national company particularly privatising all public services, including services that should not be run for profit. There are digs at the corporate culture of the 80s of backstabbing, drug taking and basically only caring about profit when older businessmen do at least care about their products and consumers. This is certainly a criticism of Reganism and Thatcherism and the idea of business being a left to their own devices. There are also broader satires in the form of adverts and news reports, tackling American militarism, consumerism and attacked the idea of a Star Wars laser system. There are even modern comparisons (as of 2013) you can put to the film because many American cities, including Detroit, have declared bankruptcy or on the edge of bankruptcy. There are many cities in Mid- West of America suffering from industrial and urban decline, population decline, underfunded public services and social issues like poverty and crime, leading to a vicious circle. RoboCop can act as a commentary on these themes. One of the other key parts to the film is RoboCop finding his humanity and discovering his past, giving the film more heart and making you care more for Murphy as his life is robbed from him and more then just a bad ass crime fighter. Weller actually had a different role of someone regain his emotions and life, made tougher due to the character having a helmet covering most of his face. Weller puts it off and he had an excellent supporting cast, from Nancy Allen as a tough as nails cop who realises who RoboCop really is, Ronny Cox and Kurtwood Smith as the villains and Ferrer as a typical young highflyer in 80s culture. RoboCop is a product and commentary of its time but it is still an entertaining action film with substance, something Verhoeven does really well and it is a shame that R-rated sci-fi and action film are made as much as they use to." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong. That's Murphy's Law indeed. That's what happen to Alex Murphy (Peter Weller). Directed by Paul Verhoeven, written by Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner and set in a crime-ridden Detroit, Michigan in the near future, police officer Alex Murphy is brutally murdered by a gang of cop-killers lead by Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith). Yes, Red from that's 70's Show. Man, is he gets brutal in this movie. The movie's death scene of Murphy was the most important scene in the whole film by the director Verhoeven not because it was mere blood and guts but because it was an extremely disturbing scene where a person is tortured to death and dies in agony. It was the fullest expression of the violence of American society as viewed by Verhoeven. The movie is filled with very critical outlooks on a hyperbole negative stereotype of 80s American society, some seem very true to this day. The violence in this film is so over the top, it's silly in a way. Anyways, in some odd outlandish unrealistic way, he survived the attack. I don't know if I saw a man get 50 bullet holes in him. I would think he would be clearly dead, but he did somehow pull through. Like the 1974's Six-Million Dollar Man, Murphy is subsequently revived by the malevolent mega-corporation Omni Consumer Products (OCP) as a superhuman cyborg law enforcer known as RoboCop. Robocop nailed the cyborg concept with a cumbersome first generation unit meshed with a human being who slowly starts to piece together and remember his past human life. Over time the flashbacks that occurred gave him the memories to the point, that he seek vengeance on the gang that killed his former self. This movie is very stylish with its gore, and sort of 'yuppie' 80s businessmen cocaine type villain. The way, Paul Verhoeven shot the film with crazy 'comic' like angles gives the film, it's creative original. The movie drew it's success from the portrayal of this stoic, priority driven machine that was also something more. I liked Murphy wasn't explicitly human when he became Robo Cop, he was just a robot with the face of a man--but every now and then, that robot; something so incapable of humanity, would do something subtle and perfect, like smile or twirl his gun, and it created this illusion of a man trapped inside the machine. Murphy's slow, subtle regaining of his humanity, and his own innate sense of order and justice made the film. This movie also works as dark satire comedy with the over the top reporting and fake commercials that is throughout the film like the 'nukem' board game. In my opinion, the movie could had done without those things, because it makes away from the main plot of Robo Cop seeking revenge. There was a bit of controversial coming from this movie. The movie was originally given an X rating by the MPAA in 1987 due to its graphic violence, in sharp contrast to most other X-rated movies that received the rating due to strong sexual content. RoboCop was X-Rated 11 times before getting a R Rated. To appease the requirements of the ratings board, Verhoeven reduced blood and gore in the most violent scenes in the movie, including the executive shot to death by ED-209, Murphy's execution, and the final battle with Boddicker. A lot of kid toys were created when this movie came out, and the movie isn't a kid movie at all! It's ultimate violence, has nudity, gore and harsh language. While the marketing for the toys is market for children, the movie is a rare Sci-Fiction made for adult. It's make it even more rare today, where most Sci-Fiction movies today are PG-13.Robocop has lot of great themes like about the will of the human spirit overcoming greed and corruption. This is eugenics defined. Man and machine merging together creating a police state of the classes and no will towards freedom of expression. RoboCop themes cover a lot of issues, the media, gentrification, corruption, privatization, capitalism, identity, dystopia and human nature. Director Paul Verhoeven, known for his heavy use of Christian symbolism, states in the documentary \"Flesh and Steel: The Making of RoboCop\" that his intention was to portray RoboCop as a Christ figure. I just didn't see this. I really don't see RoboCop in the same light of Jesus. Unless, Jesus shot a bunch of drug- dealers during his time on Earth. The character of RoboCop itself was inspired by British comic book hero Judge Dredd. You can see the similarities clearly with the robot design suit. Taking influence from Japanese comics \"The 8 Man\" and the first Tokusatsu Metal Hero \"Uchuu Keiji Gavan (Space Sheriff Gavan)\" from Toei. Based on Peter Weller, the suit was hard to move in. You can clearly see that in the film. There are moments that I think Robo Cop might trip or fall over when he walk. It isn't that bad. By making him so stiff, it's allows us to believe that he is indeed a Robot. The stop motion is a bit dated and laggy, but it was pretty cool at the time. I did like ED-209. The sound was a bit trippy. There was apparently no sound re-editing in the film, because the scenes feel very rough in terms of audio, and you can even hear where certain sounds are looped in order to fill the newfound soundtrack gaps in the extended scenes. The score is amazing, Basil Poledouris did a good job. I'm not looking forward to RoboCop reboot in 2014. Here all I see is a man inside of a black Iron Man style suit who is swift moving and acts with too much human emotion to portray a realistic cyborg. It's so unlike this movie. In the end, RoboCop is a deep well made satire with amazing effects and top-notch emotional drama" "Extremely violent but entertaining and smart film(directed with high energy and style by Paul Verhoeven) about a viciously murdered policeman being \"resurrected\" in a scientific experiment involving placing his mind, and some body parts, into a mobile machine(called Robocop) where he will be sent out to fight crime in a brutal and corrupt Detroit in the near future. Peter Weller and Nancy Allen are very good here, playing former partners trying to adjust to the situation, all the while fighting not only vicious drug gangs, but the very company that built the Robocop technology. The supporting cast is very good, the writing sharp,(much effective satire here) and the model F/X astonishing. Only issue is that it doesn't know when enough is enough at times,(climax gets pretty wild) but otherwise a pretty good film, first of a trilogy." "Robocop is a great with a good storyline that sometimes falls flat but is overall strong and different,the cast aren't brilliant,but all the highly exaggerated action and effects won't make their performances a huge problem.Peter Weller does do a good job,but thats only once he becomes Robocop,who is suppose to be motionless.The movie had some surprising heart,very likable characters and the effects were very impressive for a movie made in 1987.It probably won't turn out very good,but I look forward to seeing the remake next year,it will be interesting to see how it could look today,which much better effects available.Robocop certainly isn't perfect and you should definitely toss your brain out the window before you watch it,but its a must see for all action fans. Alex Murphy (Peter Weller),a police officer,is murdered by a gang of criminals,but borough back to life as a cyborg,known as Robocop,who fights crime and never sleeps,now looking to track down the criminals who killed him." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "The story of a young American policeman who after being brutally murdered is then brought back to life as a robot losing everything but his face and the memories of his loved ones. Although tragic in a way, Robocop or Murphy as he preferes to be known adjusts well to his new life as a kind of metal man, he benefits greatly from his new bulletproof body especially in fire fights with baddies. It's also worth noting how much free time Robocop now has due to being relieved of the need to sleep or urinate, and credit to him he uses his time well to hunt down the very people who murdered his human self and left him the pathetic shell he's now became. But it's not all doom and gloom as Robocop flirts with and eventually woos a young lady called 'Lois' and the two go on to enjoy a whirlwind romance, Robocop thrilled at one last chance at love whilst Lois at first impressed with her new fiances firm handshake eventually loses interest at his inability to procreate. Heart broken but also still very much a robot Robocop removes his helmet and goes on a rampage leading to the death of Dick Jones a brilliant entrepreneur and all round good egg." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Despite all the setbacks in production of this film. Note that RoboCop is a film. Not a movie. The wonderful narrative of RoboCop is that despite being an armored-clad cop, Murphy is portrayed as vulnerable. That is unfortunate in movies today. Too often, many a protagonist faces off with a half-assed antagonist and barely breaks a sweat en route. What RoboCop is up against is simply politics. Awesomely portrayed as a neo-Roman Empire with unlimited and ruthless conglomerate. This is not too far-fetched as one would think with the \"Great Recession\" in vogue. The conflict is that RoboCop is built by an ambitious exec who has a rivalry with the VP of the same conglomerate. While this may seem like a permeation of Mad Men, it's manifested in the plausible future where the municipalities of Detroit are literally bankrupt. The VP brokers a deal with Boddicker the prominent crime czar who parallels dick Jones VP in the conglomerate, only difference is that Boddicker is not employed by any official entity. Boddicker is a VILLAIN. He has no delusions or justification of what he does. He does it gleefully and makes no apologies afterward. Producers take note of this antagonist. I get so tired of all these civilized Blofeld types who \"kill you with kindness\". Boddicker is a villain you enjoy hating. That provokes emotions which...well, the film has done it's job! There is violence, but for today's standards, is pretty tame. It's not the gory kind, rather the kind that shows violence without implying. Just straight to the carnage. The film is really grounded in the way it portrays the future. No flying vehicles, time travel, or teleportation here. Just a raw gritty dystopia in the context of a political thriller dabbled with a satirical throwback to the yester-years of Reagan-ism. Truly, a sci-fi entry in the annals of the genre. I'll just say this much: RoboCop is not a \"movie\", it is a film in the boneyard of ghastly crap. Audaciously calling itself \"sci-fi\". Total Rekall, Blade Runner, Aliens, and 2001 are all films. Not \"movies\"."

"*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "\"RoboCop\" is as good as it gets when it comes to action films. It achieves that particular distinction of being both smart and fun at the same time. While on the one hand it satisfies as extremely visceral entertainment, it takes such a satirical look at the world of the future - commercials, newscasts, and all - that it delivers many good and substantial chuckles. It's done in a classic comic book tradition, with heroes for whom you can root and villains who are deliciously evil. It takes place in the Detroit of the near future, when the police force is now being funded and controlled by a private, omnipotent corporation named OCP. Its vision of the future is pretty bleak, with the cops being overwhelmed by various degenerate lunatic criminals. Fortunately, an executive named Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer) has an innovative idea: take a police officer \"killed\" in the line of duty and transform them into a sleek, sophisticated cyborg. The cop who gets this honour is Murphy (Peter Weller), who isn't as \"perfect\" as his creators would like: he still retains some human memories and becomes obsessed with punishing the bad guys who put him in his current predicament. Superior urban hell production design, wonderfully rousing music by Basil Poledouris, and lots of hit-you-across-the-face bloody violence help to make this a solid diversion all the way from start to finish. It's just a hell of a lot of fun. The special effects are (for the most part) amazing; Rob Bottin, who'd wowed us with his work on \"The Howling\" and \"The Thing\", is the man behind the look of RoboCop, and Phil Tippett supervises the stunning ED-209 sequences. The excellent cast also includes Nancy Allen, Daniel O'Herlihy, Robert DoQui, Ray Wise, Felton Perry, and Paul McCrane, but making the biggest impressions are Ronny Cox and Kurtwood Smith as two of the most vile bad guys to ever be committed to celluloid. Weller does a fine job of working within his cumbersome costume and creates some very human moments amid all of the nastiness on display. Allen, in a change of pace type of role, is appealing as the partner who maintains her connection to her partner, no matter what. Ferrer is good sleazy fun as the ambitious young creep. \"RoboCop\" is overall so sharp, funny, and exciting that it holds up quite well on repeat viewings. It's no surprise that it would spawn a franchise consisting of two sequels, a live action TV series, an animated series, and an upcoming remake. 26 years later, it's still one of the best action films of the past few decades. 10 out of 10." "Robocop The key to creating an ideal cyber-cop is ensuring that when salvaging tissue from the donor not to transfer over the donut-craving gene. Fortunately, the scientists in this sci-fi movie only relocated the deceased's face and memories. After being killed by a crime syndicate kingpin (Kurtwood Smith), the bullet-riddled body of Officer Murphy (Peter Weller) becomes the basis of Omni Consumer Products - the police force's parent company - first foray into mechanized officers. Tasked with cleaning up the gang-controlled streets while his human counterparts go on strike, Robocop is diligent. But when his old partner recognizes him, the floodgates holding back his memories of being Murphy are opened. A gory parody concerning the privatization of the public sector, Robocop is a smart Frankenstein-esque story that stimulates the brains low and highbrow hemispheres. While they are still cops, thankfully, the robotic ones only sexually harass the police precinct's vending machines. (Green Light) vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca" "The story essentially begins when policeman Alex Murphy is shot to death by the movie's villains in a proverbial industrial hideout. But luckily it's a quick death. Oh wait, no... no it's not. It's not a slow death at all. In fact, it is worth noting for those who proceed unawares that Murphy is not Robocop before he get's shot. You could be forgiven for thinking that he is, because he skillfully stays on his feet while being shot multiple times with multiple shot guns. Murphy is given the Darth Vader treatment and quickly resurrected as a lean mean metal machine out to get the villains who sorta killed him. The villains are a gang of thugs who aren't so much ferocious fiends as they are fanatical fun boys. One cackles like a hyena, one is a club- goer, one is a ginger jerkoff, and one can't fly. But they all enjoy turning an all-American cop into Swiss cheese. They are lead by a bald bespectacled guy named Clarence. Clarence has one problem. Cops don't like him, so Clarence don't like cops. Cops of the robo variety don't like him much either. Then there's Ron Miller! Ron Miller doesn't like to be jerked off. When people jerk him off, they die. Who is Ron Miller? He's the hostage taker who doesn't like to be jerked off. What do you get when you watch Robocop? Corporate politics, smart sexy girls, \"I'd buy that for a dollar,\" and a murdering robot named Ed who squeals like a pig when he falls over, Dead or alive you're coming with Robocop. However, if you're a rapist or a burgler, you will not be apprehended." "I'm a person from the 80's decade, this film was part of my childhood I saw this when I was about 8 if you can believe that, it's my favorite movie from one of my favorite movie directors Paul Verhoeven but most importantly this is one of my favorite movies of all time. There is just so much to this film which is one of the reasons I love it. On the surface it seems like a typical superhero story, but underneath there are layers that elevate this film to be something even more. The production value, special effects and makeup work by my favorite makeup artist Rob Bottin are all great and they still look great today because their all practical. There was a huge budget backing this film and they used every cent wisely because a truck load of effort and heart was behind it. Music is great from one of my favorite movie composers the late great Basil Polebouris, that Robo theme is one of my favorite theme songs ever. The action is great it is well choreographed and extremely violent with the gore effects involved, one of my favorite shoot out scenes is the infamous drug warehouse battle it was awesome not just on how many baddies Robo can kill but just seeing Robo use tai chi like movements with his gun against them. The villains are great from Dick Jones played well by Ronny Cox whom is a ruthless CEO that is interested in both making money and becoming the head of OCP not caring how many lives he destroys. However the one villain that really stands out for me is Clarance Bodyger play well by Kurtwood Smith. He is a right hand man for Jones whom also wants to make the big bucks, however he's also a borderline psychopath that just loves to kill cops and innocent people for fun. I also like how he has sort of this dark charisma and sometimes seems to exhibit some sort of anger management issues. And of course the other villain is the ED-209 robot, which is a great design that has been homaged in many other works. But I find the robot both menacing but funny because despite it's capabilities and how big it is, it never works correctly. Let alone like a video game boss is easy to beat once you know it's weaknesses. We see a parallel with Clarance and his criminal organization and OCP, both are businesses and their goal is simply to make money. Like in one scene we hear what Clarance's organization was going to do with the stolen money from the armored truck which was to us it as capital investment just to make more money. Dick Jones in a scene mentions when Delta City is being built illegal gambling, drugs, and prostitution will be on the rise and that would mean more money for both Dick and Clarance. The OCP company alone is interesting, it seems like a company that does great things and could of done even more but the problem is it's their greed, selfishness, and even slightly unrealistic ambitions are what keep them from making a difference. The film deviantly acknowledged the Regan era when capitalism and technology were both on the rise. The future portrayed in this film is very much prolific to what is happening today. This film has mean spirited fun with it's use of humor/black humor and satire that hits close to home, as it tackles the issues of privatization of services, monopolization, consumerism, and our common addiction to technological progress. To me the funnest moment was in those commercials we saw like that board game \"Nuke Em\" I'm still wondering what the rules of that game are. But also the film dealt with a philosophical concepts of identity, humanity and transition. Alex Murphy/Robocop is played flawless by one of my favorite actors Peter Weller, this is my favorite role from him. He hit the right notes in both emotion and physicality. I really loved how he moved which were sort of miming and tai chi like movements, he was believable as a robot moving at a strange yet natural sort of speed where he was swift but slow at the same time. The capabilities and abilities of Robo are great from his trademark gun twirl I always love, I do that every time I play a light gun video game. Though to me the most impressive was the data probe which gives you the ability to download and upload info on the computer from your brain, almost reminiscent of the sci-fi stories of William Gibson which always had to do with technology and humans trying to integrate together. But most of all I really love the amount of emotion he was able to display making Alex/Robo and superhero you feel a heavy sense of pathos for. Alex/Robo is having an identity crisis as memories of his former life download and he is just struggling to make sense as to who he is. Is he a man that was turned into a machine and is just remembering he was once a man; or is he a machine dreaming he was once a man and desires to be one. One scene I always found heartbreaking was when Alex/Robocop visits his home only to find it empty and the memories of his past flood in, that scene always made me tear up because it really showed two things a life that Alex/Robo can never go back to and also how being a superhero is never without a price to pay. This all the more makes us want Alex/Robo to win not just to overcome the forces of evil but to reclaim or find his humanity. Robocop has all the right part that continue to make him work. Rating: 4 stars" "I fondly remember seeing RoboCop as a mid-teen (sorry Dad) and being impressed by it's loud explosions, gun battles, highway chases and overall attitude. I view it now as a dressed to impress satire of quick- fire American news and commercials, almost as if Dutch maestro Paul Verhoeven decided to serve the U.S a massive overdose of it's own excess. Seeing the film after many years, it's this satirical element that really stands out. The action is noisy and brash, the bad guys are overblown to the point of verging on comical, and the violence, particularly the scene in which Peter Weller is blasted to bits before his Robo transformation, still shocks. Technically, as you might expect for an 'R' rated science fiction film coming out in the late 80′s, the special effects are something of a mixed bag of bolts. At times the FX look worse than bad Ray Harryhausen, especially when a clunky looking ED209 wobbles into the scene, but the now iconic Robo suit really holds up. Amid the violence and noise, there's a sad story here too as Murphy's consciousness, now trapped inside the RoboCop suit, battles with his programming to ascertain his own identity. Flashbacks taunt him and like Frankenstein's monster, there is a strong sense of pity felt throughout. While sometimes the silliness prevents it from attaining the classic status of say 'The Terminator', RoboCop proves to still be a curious mix of satire, overblown 80′s action and good old fashioned sci- fi." "The 80's was the epidemic of landmark movies. It was no doubt an era of heavy artillery supplied by Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger. To name a few; Predator 87\", First Blood 82\", Aliens 86\", The Terminator 84\" and more would all go forward to rule the 1980's. Released in 1987, Robocop would have to bring something explosive to the table. This futuristic sci-fi takes place in Detroit were crime rate is at its highest. The streets are crawling with Junkies, prostitutes while a global tech business, OCP (Omni Consumer products), over looks the city and controls the reign of law. It does not get more gritty than the portrayal we see at first hand. OCP is known for its advanced technology and continuity in daily developments created and mastered to protecting the public from the scum. With not much belief in your average police department, it is when the giant company buys out the police task force in hopes to creating something stronger and less vulnerable as murderers and rapists pile the dark streets of Detroit. It is when rogue cop Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is blasted to death during a tense infiltration into one of Detroit's cold blooded gangs, (a gruesome scene that joined movie history) that sees Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer) of OCP perform a body transformation. With adjustments to save the general organs of Murphy's remains, the staff at OCP construct a steel shell around the dead body of Murphy resulting in a \"\"Robocop\",a programmed walking talking killing machine assigned to protect the innocent with the ability to sustain and arrest. While Murphy's soul is nothing short of deceased, it is when former partner and witness to the crime Lewis (Nancy Allen) discovers the man behind the metal plates resulting in Robocop's reflection of memories, which is something OCP didn't want. The action packed plot sees Bob's Robocop create a kill list behind the death of his former self. The main target is indeed, in my opinion one of the biggest dirt bags to ever hit our screens, Clarence (Kurtwood Smith). If Satan had an apprentice, it was this guy. It delights me to witness the path of revenge that Robocop follows, leading to an all out war as Clarence and his men try ridding the streets of the only thing standing in their way. Although OCP staff and second man on the managers board Dick (Ronny Cox) represents true justice, Dick has eyes on a different future for the advanced company, a future without Robocop, which leads Robocop on an investigation that connects dots between the criminals of Detroit and the rich that overlook it. Ah yes, the nostalgic reflection of this movie still excites me. One year before my birth, Robocop was swarming cinemas global, estimating a total of 13,000,000 in budget. Just like a plethora of 80's action, Robocop was, and still is one of the best of that era. Its concept was highly original then, and unfortunately could not have competed with The Terminator and T2, it did succeed in terms of Sci-fi action and joined a host of movies that showed the possible gruesomeness of real-life shootings. Scene of Death: Upon the origin of Robocop, Murphy had to make a sacrifice. Not knowing he would become a protective cyborg of Detroit, he foolishly rushed in, disturbing a group of animals, resulting in a terrifying scene. Do you remember? He had his leg, arm, and eventual head blasted with shotguns, machine guns the lot. Clarence and his affiliates were a new breed of murders and rapists, which lead to a whole new direction in my movie history. The gore was frightening and the screams of laughter toward a dead cop is more haunting. The acting is far from convincing. The overall cast consisted of some well known faces of that era, if not genre of movies. In my opinion, it was just as well Peter Weller had to play out the movie in a metal suit and robotic concept as I don't think I could have stuck his cheesy acting through-out the 150minutes or so. Although he is the hero an lead star, he is the worst actor associated with this classic... sorry. Apart from a handful of low budget movies, Weller has done the voice for Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1 & Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 2...random? Ronnie Cox, as we know from Eddie Murphy's Beverly Hills Cop, was then and maybe still an accomplished actor playing numerous roles of good and bad. Kurtwood Smith made appearances in Deep Impact, Rambo 3, Broken Arrow and many more. Apart from its cheesy one liners, Robocop is and always will be one of my Childhood favorites. I know, it was strictly 18's (strictly), there was just no way I wasn't watching this movie. Unfortunately I can't say the same for what was to follow. I am sure the majority of fans will agree if I say that RoboCop 2 was mediocre, although it will never, NEVER be as bad as RoboCop 3!!! It is hardly worth referencing, but I believe the situation was played out with Peter Weller witnessing a script that read Robotic Ninjas and immediately decided to shove the pen he was given up the writers ass! For those who don't know, a re-make is set for release in 2013, with a cast Gary Oldman, Joel Kinnaman and Samuel L. Jackson. At this stage I struggle to see how anything can go wrong when the legendary Gary Oldman is involved. Joel Kinnaman is the star of the murderous TV series, The Killing. As for Samuel Jackson?... Overall: 80's Sci-fi action, 80's bloodshed, 80's acting = a dam good time! Did you enjoy my review? check out my previous and up to date reviews at my blog - http://gerrysreviewsforthosecurious.blogspot.com/" "At the time this movie came out, RoboCop addressed a lot of issues that were occurring at the time. The plot was actually your regular cop drama but with science fiction twist inserted right in the middle. Writers Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner have made a film that not only makes us wish RoboCop was a real figure but also reveals the power struggle between the good-willed and corrupt individuals in and out of normal society. Then there's also director Paul Verhoeven who tops the whole project with his signature of blood, guts and more blood. As the well-known story goes, RoboCop was once a humble human being. His name was Alex Murphy, both portrayed by actor Peter Weller. And he does not become RoboCop until he is brutally murdered while trying to arrest a few gang thugs. Once Murphy is reborn as the ultimate killing machine, he then sets out to do what he was programmed to do. Weller gives a stellar performance as the cyborg that he is. The movement of RoboCop is very much applaudable. It gives the illusion that he's scanning, analyzing, and calculating his options for each situation that he's in. Don't you wish you could do that? Playing the thugs' leader is Clarence Boddicker, acted by Kurtwood Smith. Smith is so convincing with his character, that it almost seemed like he was having fun being Boddicker all the time! It's ironic because who would want to know him? Boddicker has no soft spots anywhere, for anyone. And there's a difference because he's not a psychotic killer; he's heartless. He's a five year old child who has a \"blow up things\" mindset in a forty year old man's body. He doesn't care what collateral damage he makes either as long as it satisfies him. Even weirder is the fact that some may find Smith's character more appealing that Weller's! Interestingly enough, RoboCop is able regain a bit of his humanity when he ends up running into one of Boddicker's pals. It's from there he starts to become conscious of who he was, what he had, and what he is now. And although RoboCop is not a big talker at first, he does have his moments of comedy and sadness, which will make the audience like his character a little more every time he's on screen. It was thoughtful of the writers to give RoboCop a part of his old life back, because otherwise there wouldn't be much for the audience to be happy about. Yes so he's now much more powerful than he was as a human, but what's it like now to be him? Thankfully, that question is answered and it's almost tear jerking at times. Note that I've only gone over the main characters. Now there's the topic of costume design and make-up effects. These two groups really had something going here. The idea of what RoboCop should look like is enthralling. What baffles me to this day is how they got it to look like the face of Peter Weller was stapled onto the front of a robotic head. These people literally had to know what they were getting themselves into when they signed onto this project. How to get a human being to look like that requires a lot of creativity. The action is good too. And by action, I define it as the amount of carnage. Whenever Paul Verhoeven makes a film, blood is a requirement and this film delivers it by the pint. It's not a gore festival but it is on the bloodbath scale. The music, composed and conducted by Basil Poledouris is a valuable element to the film as well. The movie has its own theme and it has light brushes sci-fi tunes in it too. It's a film that is hard not to enjoy. Noted as one the best science fiction films ever made, this film was a star-making role for Peter Weller. The violent scenes fit the tone perfectly as do the dramatic moments between them." "The black comedy is funny, although sometimes you feel bad laughing at so much violence, but the sideswipes are the best. Verhoeven takes digs at TV with his advert filled news broadcasts, at privatisation by showing the crumbling police stations and the huge corporate towers and at heroism by showing Robocop creating just as much mayhem and destruction as the criminals he pursues. His strength however is the action scenes and the sense of tension he creates - I'll don't think anyone can forget the sheer terror of ED209's 'glitch'. Weller is good - cast because of his strong jaw and ability to project emotion through a suit of armour - and he does manage to bring out the human side. Allen is good but a but dry. The real support comes from the eccentric, and well known villains and corporate bosses. Ronny Cox, Smith, Ray Wise, Perry, O'Herlihy and Miguel Ferrer are all great in various capacities. Criminal or greedy corporate leader - it's hard to tell which is which at times. A classic bit of sci-fi. Verhoeven has sadly not had a moment as fine as this since and has recently had problems being excessive in Hollywood - the land of excess! This is a landmark film that may not be to everyone's taste." "In theory, and from it's ridiculous title, Robocop is an incredibly silly film. The crime ridden streets of Detroit in the not-too-distant future, get a futuristic superhero, a knight in shining armour, from an omnipotent corporation OPC, to protect them from the criminals. However, what we actually get is a very emotional human story, along with some incredibly sharp satire. Murphy (Peter Weller), a police officer, is killed whilst on a mission with his new partner, Lewis (Nancy Allen). OCP (after a failed attempt at a robot-police programme) commissioned the Robocop program, and Murphy becomes the candidate. His memory is supposed to have been erased by the corporation however, he is reminded by Lewis of his identity. He pieces together the criminals that gunned him down after an incident with Emil (Paul McCrane), and uncovers the criminal machinations of corrupt, corporate business. As all good science fiction should, Robocop is partially allegorical of the times it was made in. In business, greed, power and wealth dominated (as highlighted in more explicit terms in another film of the same year, Oliver Stones Wall Street (1987), where \"greed is good\"). Here, violence and deceit are the tactics used to make it in the cut-throat business world. Miguel Ferrer's young, ambitious Bob Morton, and the older rival, Ronny Cox's Dick Jones, battle with each other to get their individual police-robot project's into production. Corruption was also an all pervading element of '80's business (something that was not new of course, we can go back in American history and find many corrupt governments and institutions, Tammany in New York is one example), and we see here the corporate elite working with the criminal underworld. The excesses of the 1980's greed is permeated within the excesses on screen. Violence is strong, yet comical at times. but it is always over the top. In an early scene, Dick Jones presents his product robot police officer, ED-209, a hulking, malevolent monster. In demonstration, ED-209 malfunctions and shoots an executive hundreds of times, to the point of joke. When Murphy is gunned down, we see his hand explode. Of course this reveals a corporate paranoia underneath some of the movies of the 80's. Each decades science fiction needs paranoia: In the 1950's and 60's it was communism and the nuclear bomb: in the 1970's and 80's it was political and corporate. The film is injected with some spot-on satirical humour. Adverts are seen throughout, further exacerbating the excesses of American culture at the time. We see commercials selling over-sized, gas guzzling automobiles (6000 SUX), replacement hearts (this clearly to alleviate the excesses on the body caused in the 80's), and a board game of the Battleship-kind (Nuke-Em). These along with the narrative create an almost perfect package. Directed by European Paul Verhoeven who epitomises the concept that the best way for America to hold a mirror up to itself, is to get outsiders to produce something that reflects the madness that was 1980's, Reagan-era, excess and greed. Not only does it offer a commentary, the humanistic, philosophical nature of the soul, is a strong (if often used) theme. Quite horrifically however, the film manifested into something terrible. I'm not talking about the sequels. The film was to be marketed for children, in the form of a cartoon series, and the inevitable action figures et al. So, like Gremlins (1984), this more \"adult\" fantasy, marketeers still had the moral sense (sic) to market violence to children - how lovely! www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "(www.plasticpals.com) RoboCop was one of the big hits of 1987, even though its title is a bit misleading (our hero is actually a cyborg, not a robot). It has much in common with the recent slew of comic super hero origin stories, but its R rating should not be taken lightly due to the shocking amount of gore. It's elevated above similar films through its satire of American culture, which include a number of broadcast news segments. Set in a crime-ridden future Detroit, a mega corporation wants to clean up the streets before they begin a massive building project. The corporation (OCP) is so huge that they have privatized the police force and have two separate robotics divisions working on automated solutions to Detroit's crime spree. One has developed a robot which malfunctions and subsequently obliterates an executive within the first ten minutes, and the other leads to the creation of RoboCop. The characters are almost totally one-dimensional, and we barely get to know officer Murphy before he undergoes his transformation. His character is further hampered because once Murphy's body is replaced with bionic parts, he doesn't speak very much. It doesn't work quite as well as in The Crow, another movie with a silent, seemingly invincible protagonist who has returned from the dead to seek revenge on those who murdered him. Most of the drama comes from the rivalry between two of OCP's executives, though there are some scenes where Murphy begins to remember his past life that give him some humanity. RoboCop's new abilities are surprisingly limited. Most of the time, the only thing that really distinguishes him from a human cop is his slow, deliberate walk and his bullet-proof armor. If made now, one would expect to see a much more agile and powerful version of the character. Now we've got movies like Iron Man, and video games like Deus Ex: Human Revolution which explore many of the same themes in a much more entertaining and intelligent fashion. That said, there's supposedly a remake in the works, which will be the 2nd Paul Verhoeven favorite to get the treatment after Total Recall (which is in production at the time of this writing). The core idea behind RoboCop isn't especially original, given that shows like The Six Million Dollar Man and characters like Darth Vader preceded it, but the way it all comes together is still pretty entertaining. There's some fun stop-motion animation effects for the ED 209 robot, and the hero is pure boyish wish fulfillment. Since its release RoboCop has become a cult classic amongst sci-fi film fans, and other than a few sequences where the image quality suffers, it holds up pretty well."

"*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "It's 24 years since I first saw this work at the movies and I'm still convinced it's very special. Paul Verhoeven brought to the screen a cyborg that was actually more believable than The Terminator. And although it wasn't an assassin; it didn't mess around either. That additional touch of humanity gave it great depth. He also assembled a B-movie cast that were perfectly matched and contrasted in characters & temperaments. They're the most naturally believable group of players. It's the future. And it's in Detroit, for a change. Paul Weller plays Murphy, a smart young cop trying to be a good husband and father-figure. During a heist he is ambushed by the villains and murdered. A high-tech corporation owns the franchise for law & order. They take his brain and fit it into a cybernetic body. Nancy Allen plays his partner and would-be friend, Lewis. Arch-crook who lead that ambush and most of Detroit's crimewave is Clarence Boddicker, played with wonderfully sleazy panache by Kurtwood Smith (a villain called Clarence?). Ronny Cox makes an equally greaseball executive insider. Dan O'Herlihy plays the corporate CEO. They, and a few others, are absolutely the business. Verhoeven's works are notoriously violent and this movie set his template. Yet, it's more than just violent; it's ironic and hilariously witty at times, though the comedy is often very dark. There's a host of memorable one-liners with hints of 'Dirty Harry'. But here, there's something else - a sly little comment about the relevance and even remanence of human identity. Post cyborg 'Robocop' Murphy, who is supposed to be a simple programme, begins having flashbacks. Soon, the greater part of his memory begins returning. In particular, recollections of his - now - widow, son and home re-surface. Verhoeven handles these curiously under-explored issues with quite an amazing subtlety. Murphy knows what he is. But now he must come to terms with what he's lost. Spielberg's 'Bicentennial Man' spent more than 2 hours and yet said nothing more. No one-issue dominates here. Verhoeven keeps the plot moving fast. With his re-awakening come memories of his murder. His cyborg half employs technology to trace the culprits, his human half wants revenge. On top of all this come special-effects that still hold good today. A shoot-out between himself and a giant robot inside the plush suite of executive offices is quite awesome. Whist slipped-in between takes, are spontaneous depictions of topical newscasts both hilarious & terrible. I've given this movie 10 stars because what it does, it does without flaw. It's seminally violent, hilarious, spontaneous, fast-moving, well-acted, smartly-scripted, untypically thought-provoking, with great special-effects. Finally; it's amalgamation of political prostitution, corporate cynicism, and tenuous morality is probably a closer representation of our dystopian future than many more celebrated works. This movie is a classic." "Possibly one of the best comic book adaptations of the 1980s wasn't even based on a comic property. Although he didn't get involved with the franchise until the second and third installments, comic legend Frank Miller's influence is smeared all over the first Robocop. Borrowing a heavy handed anti-establishment vibe, nacho cheesy looked-better-on-paper dialog, enough gratuitous violence to make a Troma flick turn away and stereotypical corporate bigwigs around every corner, I wouldn't be surprised to learn Miller had more than a passing investment in Paul Verhoeven's futurist nightmare. Of course, it could also be that Miller's influence on the comic medium as a whole was responsible for many of these parallels. Either way, it's a dream come true for fans of the dark, gritty graphic novels that made their mark in this era. It's also far from the most expertly crafted picture, with a carefree, cavalier attitude that seeps into the acting, cinematography, special effects and storyline. Arms are blown off just for the fun of it. Speeding automobiles barrel over evildoers in lieu of a more coherent way to write them out. Strongholds erupt into geysers of fire. As with Rambo before it, the lesson of the day is wanton brutality and the titular hero is your celebrated instructor. Despite its immeasurable shortcomings as a motion picture, that blunt approach to both villain and viewer alike makes it tough to turn off. A night with Robocop is like eating an entire bag of candies in one sitting; there's more nourishing, appetizing stuff out there and we know it's wrong... but sometimes it's impossible to fight that compulsion." "This movie predicted the merging of police and technology company 20 years before it happened. Now police profiling, and suspect location is a matter of technology with our chipped passports, and drivers license that can passively monitor our locations, and hold our biometric informations. Robocop is a product of OCP more so than its a police officer. This mars what \"justice\" is depending on who's view point it is. Alex Murphy gets murdered during investigation. OCP is looking for a \"brain\" that will emotionally survive its transplant into a cybernetic body. They find it in Murphy, and transforms him into Robocop. Murphy or Robocop goes about its business, but subliminally, it still harbors memory of its murder and family. He's on the chase of gangs that killed him. This results in investigation leading back to OCP, but will OCP allow its product to conduct police action on itself ? Ground breaking low budget science fiction thriller. Although there has been a cop turned into robot idea like the 8th Man by Jiro Kuwata, and Kazumasa Hirai, this is the first live action movie of its type. There're lot of what ifs that are explored in this movie, and the design of the technology is so good that it makes this movie believable. The movie had the sober look into the future society where corporate control influences the course of the society even more significantly than what was thought possible at the time, and present it in an entertaining action science fiction. In this sense, this movie scores high as we don't have Robocops yet, but our society is heading in that direction. Great movie that's exciting and believable with lot of drama all mixed in." "In a dystopic & crime ridden Detroit, a terminally wounded cop returns to the force as a powerful cyborg with submerged memories haunting him. One of the movies where your bored, want some entertainment, and a movie pops up wanting to be watched. You watch it, not expecting much, and results vary. Either the movie was expectantly bad or the movie actually draws you in with an intelligent plot that delivers in all sorts of ways, with amazing action and amazing scenes; the movie unexpectedly takes you by it's wheel and unexpectedly shocks you with true awesomeness. Oh yeah, Robocop is the second one. With a dystopic future and intelligent and highly possible ideas, Robocop actually scores in all ways possible. The action was piercing, Robocop gets the job done and it is overall amazing. This ties in equally with the foreshadowed special effects. From the older copy of Robocop, the technology was growing older and more developed. I was actually awe-inspired even seeing this in 2011, it is seriously awesome. The acting was alright, never expected high class and received. I loved the structure of the film as well, although meaningless, the film scatters news segments and TV commercials that tie-in with the plot. The beginning of Robocop's departure into law enforcement, the action gets gritter, the film gets meaner, and everything just tugs it way forward to even more awesome. Then we have the last thing that needs to be discussed: the heart. Wait, an action film like Robocop contains heart? Yes. And it works too, with Robocop's memory slithering it's way into his robotic mind, you can't help but to feel. Not like it's the main theme, but it is overgrowing and it unexpectedly worked for the film. I overall have no complains for the film, it was a totally unexpected masterpiece. Everything was done well, and it reaches peaks those held by the Terminator. Robocop is definitely not for everyone, but those who dislike, must reconsider their liking's; as Robocop is a must-see! 9/10." "I didn't really get a chance to watch this film when it came out and didn't got around to seeing it for a very long time. But because of all the hype it was getting I decided to watch it, I can now see why this movie has so many following. This is a brilliant sci-fi flick and the direction and pacing of it all is very well done and will keep most audiences attention despite it being a bit outdated. The special effects are outdated now, but the direction and how everything progresses makes the experience exhilarating and thrilling to watch. It even has some tension to some degree because of the set pieces and because of the attachment to the main character. This movie also has a lot of action sequences and those sequences are shot in a entertaining manner although a bit over the top at times. Any action movie fans or sci-fi fans should most definitely check this movie out. I also liked the commercial breaks in between some scenes in this that was meant for the movie because of it's humor, same with the broadcasts which adds to the movie in a positive way. 8.4/10" "\"Robocop\" is one of those great sci-fi movie's next to, \"Terminator\" and \"Star Wars\". The story is about a Rookie Cop that get's killed by gangsters and he end's up getting repaired by scientists and end's up becoming a police cyborg called, Robocop. What make's this movie really great is that it had some nice action scene's, the story was good, some nice acting from Peter Weller as the main protagonist and Kurtwood Smith(Who was known for playing Red in, \"That 70's Show\") as one of the villain's in the movie, and the movie had some funny moments that will make you laugh. Overall, \"Robocop\", is a great sci-fi movie to watch if you're into sci-fi movie's or trying to look for a good movie to watch." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "RoboCop is a great action flick! It is not for people who are faint of heart at all because this movie originally had an X rating for a reason, if there was NC-17 rating systems back then this movie definitely would have qualified for it. I won't get into details but this is definitely a hard rated R movie that children should not be allowed to see. Murphy's \"death\" scene near the beginning where he is cruelly gunned down and shot to pieces over a stretched out period of time by psychotic criminals (led by the dad from That 70s Show unbelievably) is hard to stomach. Also the scene near the end where one of the bad guy's henchmen is kind of melted by dangerous acidic chemicals then blows up when he is run over by a van is disgusting too. This movie doesn't pull any punches with the blood and gore quotient and there is also a lot of funny dark humour in it too. I love this flick but make sure to notice how blood and gutsy it is before you watch it!" "Science Fiction films have come a long way since the early days of movie making. Stories about alien or future worlds were more difficult to realize back then, but with advances in technology this would change. George Lucas's first 'Star Wars' film showed that so much more was possible and it was a sign of things to come. Had it never been made we wouldn't likely have films like 'Blade Runner,' 'Total Recall,' or 'Avatar,' or at least not for many more years. 'The Terminator' is another great example of this and introduced the world to what was probably the baddest cyborg to that date. Three years later we see the opposite side of this when a humble police officer was brought back as a kind of super cop to rid the modern world of \"waste.\" Instead of being a pale imitation of that earlier classic, 'Robocop' would become a hit in it's own right and remains one of the greatest of it's kind all these years later. Pros: Universally strong cast. Neat concept. Electrifying score. Awesome effects. Quick paced. Has a cool futuristic look and feel to it. Has quite a mean streak. Plenty of exciting and well staged action sequences. Fabulous direction. Has some great social commentary. Cons: Despite being set in the future, some things age the film. The effects that were added in post aren't so seamless anymore. Final thoughts: So many action packed movies lack heart, but 'Robocop' had more to offer than explosions, car chases, and gunfire. The character of the title is like a modern superhero and the film itself is an absolute smash. It easily deserves a spot in line with all the other great Science Fiction films. My rating: 4.5/5" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Excellent Action/Sci-fi/Drama. Plot: After being brutally killed by a gang of criminals, a cop is resurrected by a megacorporation,becoming a cyborg police officer to protect a futuristic Detroit. The memory of his family and his old life is erased, but somehow comes back to him over the course of the movie. How he died comes back to him which causes him to seek revenge. Directed by Paul Verhoeven(Total Recall, Basic Instinct, Showgirls, and Starship Troopers) the movie blends bloody action violence with elements of drama. Some of the parts are actually kind of sad. Robocop isn't just some cyborg who's only mind set is to protect and serve. He's trying to find his former identity.I thought that brought a lot more character depth. Peter Weller is awesome as Robocop/Alexander James Murphy. I was very surprised to see Kurtwood Smith in this. I've always known him as the hard*** dad from That 70's Show. The dialogue is funny but not bad just as Verhoeven's Starship Troopers(One of my favorite Sci-fi/Drama's of all time) and some of the deaths are so overdone they actually become funny." "After I watched RoboCop on TV, I loved it, but when I bought the DVD, I loved it even more!!!! Since I watched movies on TV, they attend to ruin certain dialog, they have to cut scenes out, dubbing, and content (ex. blood, gore, nudity, language, sexual references). But it's better to get them uncut to see the original movie. It stars Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, Dan O'Herlihy, Ronny Cox, Kurtwood Smith, Miguel Ferrer, etc. After Omni Consumer Products (OCP) announced that it bought out the Detroit police department, the department decides to go on strike. Alex Murphy (Peter Weller), gets transferred from Metro South to the West. He and his partner, Anne Lewis, track down a group of criminals led by Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith). Unfortunately, Murphy was killed by Clarence's gang. Bob Morton, one of OCP's employees, transforms Murphy's corpse into Robocop, to compete with another employee Dick Jones' ED-209. Robocop's tests are successful. Unfortunately, Robocop rediscovers his memories (when he was Alex Murphy), and now knows he has to find and arrest Clarence Boddicker. He realizes that Clarence is working for Bob Morton's competition Dick Jones. Now, Robocop must stop both Clarence and Dick Jones. As far as his directing goes, it was pretty good when he did Basic Instinct, his directing went downhill when he directed that awful movie Showgirls, but he returns to his roots by directing Starship Troopers. I have never owned the sequels, Never seen RoboCop 2, but I never liked RoboCop 3. Overall, one of the best action movies ever made. RoboCop gets 10 stars."

"*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This is one of those movies that really embarrasses a lot of filmmakers. Robocop is the story of a police officer in a crime-ridden Detroit of the future who gets killed and turned into a cyborg law enforcer who must find those responsible for his death and reclaim his lost humanity. There have been hundreds, maybe a couple thousand, of sci-fi action movies where the basic premise of the story is at least as good as that. Yet, the overwhelming majority of those films suck really hard, while Robocop is one of the best action films of its era. In Robocop, a corporation called Omni Consumer Products is running the police force for the city of Detroit. The head of OCP (Michael O'Herlihy) wants to build a new development called Delta City in place of old Detroit, but first they need to find a way to control the raging crime wave that's crippling the city. The number 2 man at OCP is Dick Jones (Ronny Cox), but when his plan to patrol Detroit with robots fails spectacularly during a board meeting, ambitious young executive Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer) seizes the moment to get The Old Man to approve his alternative Robocop program. That program involves moving likely candidates on the police force into high crime, high violence precincts and waiting for one of them to die. The cop who gets \"lucky\" is Murphy (Peter Weller) by being horrifically gunned down by the charismatic crime boss of Detroit, Clarence Boddiker (Kurtwood Smith), and his gang. Murphy's corpse is claimed by OCP and transformed into Robocop, who launches a one-cyborg war on crime and becomes a media sensation. But then Murphy discovers the secrets behind OCP and his transformation and, with his old partner Lewis (Nancy Allen), brings the real bad guys to graphically violent justice. This is a great movie. The acting is great. The writing is great. T he direction is great. The costumes are great. The special effects (aside from some stop-motion animation that looks a little dated) are great. Robocop is one of the films that helped make the 1980s the Golden Age of the action movie. One of the best things about the film is the way the story deals with the concept of the super-human or the super-hero. Murphy is transformed by tragedy into something more than human, but the triumph of the character isn't in using his inhuman power to battle the bad guys, it's in his struggle to reassert his humanity. I once read a review that called Robocop one of the greatest super-hero origin stories ever because it recognizes and emphasizes that the important thing about the super-hero isn't the power or the costume or the codenameit's the real person inside all that. Robocop also has some of the best cultural commentary you'll ever see in an action movie. The movie creates and explores a wonderful contrast between the immorality of crime and the amorality of big business and makes you consider who is worse  those who deliberately set out to hurt people or those who just don't care who gets hurt in the pursuit of their agenda. Robocop is also notable for creating one of the most interesting \"worlds\" in sci-fi movie history. The corporatized, soulless society of future Detroit, the glimpses we get of the chaos elsewhere on Earth and the crude degeneracy of its popular culture are still compellingly perverse, even after 20+ years of the real world racing to catch up. If you like action movies, you have to see Robocop. Even if you don't like action movies, you should still watch Robocop, because if you don't like this film you can be sure you'll never like any action movie ever." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Set in the not too distant future, RoboCop is a dark satire of the media, corruption and the '80s boom of consumerism. Directed by Paul Verhoeven, it's got all of his trademarks, from explicit violence to groundbreaking special effects. I view RoboCop as sort of a prologue to Starship Troopers - we definitely see Verhoeven crafting his skills here, but this doesn't make it an amateur production - far from it. It's a basic story, which we've seen many times before - a cop, Alex Murphy, is almost killed by Clarence Bodicker, a bank robber with a foul mouth. We think he's dead - he is missing an arm, after all! He's revived by OCP, a mysterious corporation, who put him into a robotic body, the future in Law Enforcement. RoboCop isn't just a mindless action film - the storyline of OCP wanting to raze Detroit and build it again, parallels the refurbishment of towns in the early '80s, who wanted to make it more sophisticated. Overall, it's a nice change from the usual mindless action film, with nice hints of drama and satire. If you're looking for more, definitely see RoboCop 2, but you should probably skip number 3, where it all became a bit silly." "Robocop is easily a masterpiece of science fiction/action cinema and is possibly one of, if not the best sci-fi films along, in my opinion, with T2. The action scenes, especially RoboCop's final showdown with ED-209. The music is entertaining and fits the atmosphere of the film. And another thing I love is, a thing which is even more present in the X/NC-17 rated version of the film: the grittiness of not only the violence, but the film in general. The dark comedy is fitting, pops up at the appropriate times, and is actually quite funny. Peter Weller gives a tour de force performance as RoboCop. Even though you rarely see his face or him as a human, this film would undeniably not be the same without Weller as the titular character. Clarence Boddicker is also one of the greatest villains ever to be portrayed on the screen. All around, this film excels in everything a good action/sci-fi film should have: action, great CGI, great writing/directing, acting, music, atmosphere, a believable and frightening villain, a real plot, interesting setting, and something recent sic-fi/action flicks have been lacking; charm, heart, and wit." "Paul Verhoeven's greatest film to date, even better than Starship Troopers and Total Recall. The film later spawned a T.V. series and an animated cartoon series. Robocop is followed by Robocop 2 and Robocop 3. The sequels are AMAZINGLY NOT DIRECTED BY P. Verhoeven but by different directors and (sadly) not as good as the original. Plot: Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) a transferred Officer, just arrived at Detroit P.D. is told to suit up, meet with his new partner Officer Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen) and head out on patrol. On patrol they encounter Clarence Bodicker (Kurtwoord Smith in his most iconic role as a baddie) and his goons. They track him down to an abandoned factory, and enter it. Murphy is separated from his partner Lewis. He is caught by Bodicker's Goons and literally shot to pieces. His is airlifted to a hospital, but his wounds are too great and he expires. His body however is transferred discreetly to Omni Consumer Products (O.C.P) and they have a different agenda on their minds for Murphy...................... Watch this exciting film to find out. A must have film for any DVD collection." "In the 80's sci-fi/action classic, \"Robocop,\" Peter Weller plays newbie cop Alex Murphy, whom, after being ruthlessly gunned down by a crime boss and his cronies, is resurrected as a cyborg. As Robocop, Murphy is the ultimate in law enforcement, cleaning the streets of a crime-ridden Detroit (in a not too distant future that we have likely surpassed by now) all while being haunted by some unpleasant memories. \"Robocop\" is the breakthrough film from director Paul Verhoeven, whose reign over the action genre was short-lived but certainly left a mark. Like all of his best films, it pushes the envelope and the limits of good taste, all in the name of good entertainment. Verhoeven combines a bit of social commentary with his high-energy, over-the-top style, but thankfully, it still makes for a film that can be appreciated on a superficial level, too. It's just that \"Robocop\" matches its giddy goriness and intense action with some unexpected substance, and that's okay. All of this is achieved, of course, with the assistance of some solid special effects, stop-motion animation that surprisingly still looks good and a score that sticks in your head for days. In all honesty, though, there isn't much going in the character department. Peter Weller pulls through, and in spite of the fact that he isn't given much to do besides walk around in an obviously uncomfortable and cumbersome outfit, still manages to bring a human element to his Robocop counterpart. Kurtwood Smith (TV's \"That 70's Show\") lays it on a little thick as the main baddie but keeps the energy pumping through its final act, while Paul McCrane (TV's \"ER\") has perhaps the most memorable (read: revoltingly awesome) scene in the film. Verhoeven paces the film just right so that you don't have time to notice its lack of substantial characters and all you can do is just sit back and enjoy the ride. And what a great ride it is, as in spite of its minor flaws, \"Robocop\" still holds up and manages to entertain after all these years." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "\"Dick! You're Fired\"..... And so the plot of Robocop reaches it's zenith when Ronny Cox , \"meets his maker\" courtesy of an angry boss, a very angry cyborg and a classic \"Wilhelm Scream\"! Watching Robocop again in 2008 for the first time in maybe 20 years, I found it to be a thoroughly entertaining piece of work from director Paul Vorhoeven. No need to write too much here suffice to say that the best line comes at the end of the film when the aforementioned Mr Cox falls to his death(very similar to Frank Nitti'e death in The Untouchables, also a 1987 film!)after being blasted by Peter Weller's title character. Great performances from all concerned. Also terrific to see Miguel Ferrer with a full head of hair!!" "one of the funniest and most outrageously violent sci fi action pics; this deservedly classic piece of mayhem confirms the marvellously talented dutch film director paul verhoeven as a force to be reckoned with. special mention must be given to the dialogue (\"YOU CALL THIS A GLITCH!\" after a test robot riddles an excessive amount of bullets into an employee at a company conference) and hilarious swipes at corporate management (ticker tape share readings in the restroom). viva la' robocop!" "I hadn't seen this before because I thought the special effects would not be to good since it is an older movie. But, I was pleasantly surprised. Robocop looked cool. And the ED-209 machine did look really fake compared to today's effects,but it still wasn't bad. The satire, such as the TV commercials, throughout the movie was great. And I had no idea how violent and bloody this was or I would have seen it earlier. And the way the bad guys kill Murphy so he can become robocop is so disturbing because of their attitudes, just laughing and joking while someone gets their arm blown off. They definitely deserve what they got in the end. FINAL VERDICT: Your classic tale of revenge; this time with a half human/robot cop. Bloody violent, bloody good." "The perfect role for the young Leeza Gibbons: a completely superficial and insensitive TV news reader. For her, the movie was a foreshadowing. Miguel Ferrer sets the tone for his desultory career as the infamous Bob Morton. Who can forget the geeky bad guy who gets obliterated by the car after being dipped in toxic waste? Ka-blew-ie!!! Ewwwwwwwww!! And last but certainly not least: \"I'll buy THAT for a dollar!!\"" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** RoboCop(1987) on one level is an allegory on the death and rebirth of Jesus Christ. Its a topic that has been a fascination for artists almost more than anything else. Art's interest in the death and rebirth of Jesus is a continuous one. One of Paul Verhoeven's dream projects is to do a film on the topic of Jesus. The 4th Man(1984) also in certain moments was obsessed with the Jesus allegory presented in RoboCop(1987). Story makes many references to Jesus and Franenstein tales. After building up an impressive resume as an European cult film director, Paul Verhoeven in the mid 1980s decided to make it a try at Hollywood. RoboCop(1987) was his first and best Hollywood feature. When he made this, Paul Verhoeven showed some promise as a filmmaker who could take chances with taboo subject matters in Hollywood. American films since RoboCop(1987) have been dissapointments especially Starship Troopers(1997) and Hollow Man(2000). One exception of a good Hollywood film besides RoboCop(1987) is Total Recall(1990). It always saddens me when excellent foreign filmmakers(for most part) who come to Hollywood end up making mediocre films. RoboCop(1987) might have not been possible without box office success of The Terminator(1984). Like most things in cinema one form of movie always gives way to another. An interesting tidbit on RoboCop is that Arnold Schwarzenegger was considered as a canidate for main role. Due to the fact that Arnold was too big to fit into the RoboCop suit, the filmmakers went for Peter Wellar instead. RoboCop(1987) and The Terminator(1984) are two of the most influential SCIFI films of the 1980s. Look of the latter film is apparent in set designs of former. Violence in feature is shown with a dark humor approach. There are a few instants when violence enters the realm of comic books with over the top presentation. Disturbingly humorous is what I call the death of Kenny moment. Violent scenes are flamboyantly filmed by Paul Verhoeven. Some of the gore scenes are in the style of Lone Wolf and Cub, and Lucio Fulci. Daring way of showing violence that many in today's Hollywood would never do. A fun part in watching it is the cold blooded villainous performance of Kurtwood Smith. He plays his character with ability to act brutish and look intellectual at same time. You never would think just by looking at Clarence Boddicker with his bookish looks that he is a foul mouth murderer. Its funny to know that vicious bad guys are usually played by nice guys. Michael Ironside plays the same sort of character in Total Recall(1990). Editing of RoboCop(1987) is fantastic especially during the Mediabreak moments. Tangled in the satiric and violent web is a tragic tale of rediscovery. Focuses on a man who loses all that is precious to him including his human ways. The robotized Murphy is in essence in the same path as the replicants of Blade Runner(1982). Deals with similar ideas about identity and memory as Total Recall(1990). Identity and what it means to a person is the most important theme of RoboCop(1987). The main protagonist does at least get a portion of his past life which seemed lost to him. Mediabreak sequences are interludes to the main action of the plot. Mediabreak sequences and the commercials that follow them provide a humorous truth about American culture. The funniest commercial presented in the parody of the Battleship boardgame. Nancy Allen is excellent in what I think is her best role. Ronny Cox is menacing as the ruthless executive, Dick Jones. Miguel Ferrer does well in the role of the ambitious and arrogant Bob Morton. Aspect of RoboCop that story zeros in on is the dual nature of main character once he's transformed into RoboCop. Its at the moment of a dream that RoboCop begins to wonder about who he is. Peter Weller brings a lot of depth into the role to make Alex Murphy a tragic hero. Alex Murphy's death is shocking because of the way he's killed. As gruesome and over the top as any death scene in a Lucio Fulci film from the early 1980s. Its the kind of death scene one usually reserves for the end of a film. Works as a satire on the attitude and excess of the 1980s. Yuppie culture in RoboCop(1987) is shown as arrogant and obnoxious. 1980s culture has never been protrayed with the humorous edge lacking in most films about 1980s culture with exception of Heathers(1989). Rob Bottin provides some gruesome but impressive makeup effects for RoboCop. Ranks among Bottin's best work as makeup effects man alongside The Howling(1980), and The Thing(1982). Rob Bottin's effects for Murphy's bloody demise rivals anything by Tom Savini or Gianetto De Rossi. A subtle moment is when Murphy/RoboCop shoots at bottles of baby food wi help of his partner for aim. It represents the fact that RoboCop can never have children or have an intimate relationship with Lewis. A couple of action scenes are in the fashion of Hong Kong Heroic Bloodshed pics. RoboCop(1987) is made up of memorable set pieces which have their own impressive signature. Peter Weller's performance as a robot who regains his human face preemits Arnold Schwarzenegger's development of human traits in Terminator 2:Judgement Day(1991). One of the ten great SCIFI films made during the 1980s."

"I was thoroughly impressed when I first saw this in theaters and couldn't wait to get it on video. Nothing but eye candy from start to finish depicting a futuristic Detroit as both sterile and grimy (thanks to the Dallas and Pittsburgh filming locations). But I hate to say that today the film has lost a little of its punch and the special effects are obviously those of minatures rather than computer graphics. All the performances were outstanding, but the one I absolutely loved was Kurtwood Smith as Clarence, one of the greatest villains in movie history. He's not presented as some ugly, evil slimeball, but a very intelligent, slightly-built, soft-spoken, balding man with a violent streak. The action and settings are so comic book-like and even better, 80's corporate greed is satirized more than any film I've seen. Looking back, I wonder exactly the time period it's set in since everything is futuristic except the automobiles, but then again, I viewed it as a parody of 80's society. I've loved Paul Verhoeven's films before this (not his later ones except Total Recall and Starship Troopers), especially The Fourth Man and Soldier of Orange. I always found his casting choices to be odd, because he chooses actors, well known or unknown to star in his big-budget films. I thought his acting stock from Holland would have been perfect for this film; think about it: Rutger Hauer as Murphy/Robocop, Renee Soutendijk as Lewis, and Jeroen Krabbe as Dick Jones or Clarence. They have played Americans quite well before (strange since their native tongue is foreign), but I suppose Verhoeven knew what he was doing in this one. Forget the sequels, they were about the worst in history." "ROBOCOP is a great action movie, it's one of the best ever. I was a little too young when I first saw it on TV, but I've always liked it. This movie has great acting & great action & great direction which makes me proud to be half dutch! If you haven't seen, get it on DVD, it's Verhoeven's best! (not like HOLLOW MAN, that stupid movie.)" "This movie is great ! The director is great (he also make \"Basic Instinct\" and \"Showgirls\").It is very original , it is a thriller , SF , and is very violent too. It is much better than the sequels ...YOU WILL LOVE IT !!!!!" "RoboCop is one of the greatest action movies ever made. It was probably one of the most violent too. But it's one of those movies which the violence fits in really well with the plot. It takes place in the future, where Detroit is overrun by a major corporation, OCP, who just bought the police department and created a crime-fighting android that went horribly wrong. But to compensate for it, an executive creates RoboCop out of policeman Alex Murphy who was brutally gunned down by a gang of vicious cop killers. RoboCop goes on a streak of crime-fighting with great success but then he gets flashbacks of his human life and his main priority is to take out the men who killed him. But he doesn't know that those criminals are better protected than he thought. RoboCop is a definite triumph in action movies. I first saw this movie on ABC back in the late 80's and then rented afterwards and the amount of violence was much more extreme than it was on TV. It has great visual effects and sound(RoboCop has the coolest sounding gun in movie history). Unlike other reviewers I don't believe you should completely avoid the sequels, I thought they were good but I agree that they weren't as good as the first one. If it was still on, I would recommend seeing the TV show. Not one to miss but also not for the weak-stomached. 10/10" "The future is bleak. Street crime is spinning out of control and the police are losing officers at an alarming rate. Until more is done to support them, they are actually contemplating striking. Their job has gotten way too deadly. This is Detroit, the recent future. In an effort to provide the police with more funding, the city has allowed a private conglomerate, OCP, to buy the police department. OCP, a corporation which specializes in dabbling in public services (this is where the money is to be made-weapons for the military, medical services and supplies, etc.), has an interest in controlling crime. Not cleaning up crime, but controlling crime. See, there is also big money to be made by accepting kick-backs. OCP has also committed millions, possibly billions of dollars to a major urban renewal project known as Delta City (\"The Future Has A Silver Lining\" reads a billboard which towers over an attempted rape). Nobody will live or work there if crime can't be controlled. And the investment is lost. OCP has a plan. Create the perfect cop. The assignment has been given to OCP second Dick Jones (Ronny Cox), a ruthless man his subordinates would never want to cross. However, his ED-209 program is not entirely practical. Seeing his chance, Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer), ambitious junior executive, picks up the ball and runs with it. Bob convinces \"The Old Man\" (Dan O'Herlihy) that his RoboCop plan is better. All he is waiting for is a cop to, how do we say, expire in the line of duty, which should happen any day now as he has restructured the police department to increase the risk of unknowing likely candidates. Bob is waiting for a \"volunteer\". And Dick Jones is not happy about any of this. This is the world director Paul Verhoeven has fashioned in his ultra-violent, wickedly funny (yes, funny!) \"RoboCop\". Everyone is in it for \"me\", greed is worn on the sleeve, and force is the way to get it. The screenplay, penned by Michael Miner and Edward Neumeier, is sharply written social commentary on everything from workplace politics to television (there are periodic recurring shots of different characters watching the same moronic TV comedy show which seems to be on at all hours, all days, all channels!). The pacing is quick, the action is graphic (mostly gunshot wounds), the camera use and production design is stylish. The music, composed by Basil Poledouris (\"Red Dawn\", \"The Hunt For Red October\", \"Starship Troopers\") is gripping. The acting is top notch by a group of veteran supporting character actors. Peter Weller, as Officer Alex Murphy, the \"volunteer\", is perfect for the role as a good family man caught in the middle of a situation he never expected. And Kurtwood Smith (\"That '70's Show\") as Clarence Boddicker, local crime boss who wants to control it all, is excellent. \"RoboCop\" is not typical sci-fi/sci-fantasy fare. There is real intelligence going on behind this script. Although set in the recent future, there is much for us to relate to now. Is this film a prophetic message? I don't know. But what I do know is that Paul Verhoeven's \"RoboCop\" is a very thrilling, enjoyable, stylish comic book on celluloid." "This one's a bit personal since I studied screenwriting under Michael Miner, one of Robocop's two creators. I remember seeing this film long before ever knowing one of its writers and I was impressed by the way the writers cloaked a message under a great deal of sci-fi technology and action. Sure, it was one vision of the future, but with the way technology was and is going coupled with the way corporate America wishes to control it, who's to say something like this futuristic world, gripped with crime could not happen? However, through it all, good still seems to survive and sometimes conquer insurmountable odds. Also, Robocop, the device created by the corporate greed machine, became an instrument for what was good and right. It even turned on the corporate types who would seek to use it for less than rightful purposes. I must admit that I recognize THIS film as the only Robocop saga worth mentioning. All of the others strayed from the creators' original vision." "I saw this film for the second time on television and although it portrayed a good idea based on a number of earlier man-made robotic super heroes, as with many such sci-fi films there is too much reliance on effects and not enough on the story. I fear that producers and scriptwriters seem to think that people who watch such films lack intelligence when quite the reverse is true. The idea that robots could one day be used to carry out law-enforcement may be a possibility but I suspect genetic engineering may take us in another direction when criminal tendency will be eliminated from humans when those all important genes will be modified, but then other forms of human failing will have to be treated. But that assumes that we shall not be replaced by robots for everything. The Robocop ends up being the good guy who kills the bad guy and the bad robot and who lives to make Robcop 2 and 3. The question that will always be asked is who decides what is good and right, the programmer or as one day he will be, the robot programmer who makes his descendents? But then that's been dealt with in the Exterminator films, or has it?" "Most of guys who did not see Verhoeven's previous Dutch films, could not say anything but action-packed or allegory of modern capitalism from RoboCop. His personal career- Doctoral degree of Science from Leiden, Seaman of Royal Dutch Navy, and radicalist in Dutch National Broadcasting Station- is flourished by his second work in the States. He has been continuously criticizing the absurdity of modern capitalism, world subordination theory, and partially the weird feeling of sexual oppression which everybody could experience in front of his/her personal encounter of momentum in his life history. Actually, the RoboCop is to satisfy the most simple audience who could not be fed up with violence and scientific mirage. However, that is just a matter of drawing full support from major studio (whether from the Orion or not). He depicted every tenet he eagerly wanted through his early Dutch works, and he succeeded!! Now that he succeeded in expressing what he wanted to, there is no reason for him to stick to the stinky sequels. That is why he refused the RoboCop 2" "It's the first time I give a 5 to a movie and still I have a little doubt in my mind. Not about the film in itself which is, in the science-fiction category, a must-have. The problem is elsewhere. In Robocop, you will see three different worlds pictured : a) The world of the leaders where iron (polished) and money reign. b) The world of the gangsters where iron (rotted) and guns reign. c) The world of the police related heroes where iron (Robocop) and friendship reign. And between or outside these worlds : nothing or almost nothing. A wife who disappears as soon as her husband dies, wars or tragedies you can only watch through controlled TV channels. To try to pass from a world to another is nothing but safe. In fact, death waits for you in this no-man's land. Except for Robocop. What the hell does Paul Verhoeven try to tell us by picturing this claustrophobic vision of the future ? That our future lies in a clear separation between economic or ethnic groups ? That only a charismatic and heartless leader will able to control the situation ? Frightful perspective, isn't it ? Or rejoicing view of the mind, Paul? O.K. I'm through. Let's just enjoy the show ! Action, good actors and beautiful gunfights. Who can ask for anything more ? WOW !" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "After OCP announces that its bought out the Detroit police department, the department decides to go on strike. Alex Murphy gets transferred from Metro South to the West. He and his partner, Anne Lewis, track down a group of criminals led by Clarence Boddicker. Unfortunately, Murphy is killed by Clarence. Bob Morton, one of OCP's employees, transforms Murphy's corpse into Robocop, to compete with Dick Jones' ED-209. Robocop's tests are successful but, he begins to rediscover memories, and now knows he has to find and arrest Clarence Boddicker. He discovers that Clarence is working for Dick Jones. Now, Robocop must stop both Clarence and Dick Jones...... Take whatever you want from Robocop, be it a metaphor for Jesus Christ, or a huge middle finger to private companies buying the world for ownership, its an amazing movie, and a timeless classic. Seller is great as the titular character, and he puts some real effort in once he is transformed,you really do forget that Weller is in the suit, and get lost into the whole cyborg thing. If you want to go along the Christ metaphor, he dies, gets resurrected, and for added effect, he walks on water, and Jones could be classed as Gabriel, his all from grace, depicted when the old man (god) fires him. It works in a sense, but doesn't hinder the flow of the narrative. The supporting cast are brilliant, and kudos to Smith, Cox, and McCrane for putting some of their best work in this movie. Set pieces are brilliant, and there really isn't much apart from the action in the movie, unless you count Verhoevens little stab at consumerism, with his little ad breaks. All in all, it's a brilliant almost perfect dystopian vision, very topical, very funny, and unbelievably, very real. One of the most important films released in the eighties."

"Though not as good as The Terminator, Robocop is solid. and if you haven't seen it yet, you really should. Set in Detroit in the not too distant future, officer Alex Murphy is killed in the line of duty one day, but he is brought back to life as a cyborg. He becomes the city government's latest experiment in law enforcement. For a while he does his duty without question, but he slowly gains memories of his old 'human' personality including his partner, his family, and more importantly his killers. When he goes after them, he discovers that they are working for a crooked government official. Our robo-hero must bring justice to the city. Robocop is a good blend of all the right elements, never getting to absurd or too dull. Up until the last five minutes, I didn't question the improbabilities of the movie, but the ending is not only too short and abrupt but it's silly. Unlike Terminator, It is a poor conclusion to the story, but knowing that the filmmakers had a sequel in mind (or even two) I suppose this error is forgivable. Coming from Paul Verhoeven, one should not be surprised that Robocop is a little more violent than it is suspenseful, but this is his most accomplished picture, and if there are any major flaws, than they will probably go unnoticed. Hurray for Robocop!" "I remember being about 15 and going to my local store and getting this film for the first time from a store that was known for giving films of a certain certificate to under age people (let's face it most of them did) and my 1st thought being what a fantastic film. Its only since i've got older that I have realised the message in the film is quite a bleak one. It is saying that if we continue in the direction we are taking as a world we will end up with lawless societies and basically global Armageddon. The story is directed by Paul Verhoeven (who else for such a task) and told in a dark and uncompromising fashion with excellent performances from Peter Weller and Nancy Allen (until then mainly known for being the chief bitch in Carrie) but all involved play their parts extremely well. The directors cut is the definitive version of this film as it adds more depth to the story and explains it better. It really is a classic of its genre and many films have tried to copy it but none can compare. Fantastic." "***1/2 Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, Dan O' Herlihy, Kurtwood Smith, Ronny Cox and Miguel Ferrer. Directed by Paul Verhoever. The smash hit for sci-fi geeks and a movie for cops too, grisly and fascinating at the same time non-stop action with a few catchy lines in the mix. New comer police officer Alex Murphy (Weller) hot on the trail of bank robber Clarince Bobbicker (Smith; a role born to play) is soon bombarded by bullets and left for dead. Soon after high authority suit types decide to make him the ultimate law enforcer Robocop (Weller). Going through some nasty crimes and upholding the law everywhere he goes and piecing together who he really is, Robocop has become a science fiction phenomenon. Taking pieces of grunge cop \"Dirty Harry\" with the unstoppable metallic armor of James Cameron's \"The Terminator\". Kick-ass flick for the eighties and a life teaching lesson for crooks and criminals. My final rating 8/10." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "RoboCop is arguably one of the best cyborg movies of all time. Peter Weller's performance as RoboCop is touching and tough at the same time. The rest of the cast, Nancy Allen, Robert DoQui, Miguel Ferrer give great performances along with the villainous Kurtwood Smith (RoboCop's murderer), Ray Wise and the sadistic Ronny Cox who plays the corrupt OCP businessman Dick Jones, he steals the show and in many ways is more evil than Kurtwood Smith. RoboCop starts with the police force considering going on strike, and then Alex Murphy (aka RoboCop) comes in the scene. Whilst out on patrol with his new partner (Lewis), they chase a group of heavily armed bank robbers to an old mill. They split up, and Murphy is blown away (quite literally) by the crooks. You can guess the next bit, he's brought back as RoboCop, and starts going out and fighting crime, until he starts to remember parts of his past and goes out looking for answers as to his identity. The film has some very good yet dark humour. The news and advertisement brakes take a comical yet dark look at American society. RoboCop addresses big issues, such as the American society, the human sole, and the role of a police officer. Another great thing about this film was the way that OCP (the main company in the story, the ones that put RoboCop together) is portrayed. It is shown as a corrupt products company with all the members trying to kill each other. Literally. But the whole thing is headed by an old man that seems to have some integrity, only to be out shined by the sinister Dick Jones. However the film is does have some problems. . The script in some places isn't very good, but it's not as bad as it could have been. The Special effects are pretty lame, but this was made almost twenty years ago, and the film didn't have a very big budget, so I'll let this one off. Probably the biggest problem was the violence. Okay, its a movie about crime and cyborg, and of course there is going to be some violence in here. But it's just plain excessive at many points, particularly were Murphy gets killed. It's just not necessary and appalling for it to be that violent. But Paul Verhovan's film making makes all these problems seem not as bad as you would really think. He makes a masterpiece. RoboCop, in my opinion, is better than ANY of the Terminator films, however as a series, the Terminator wins on a forfeit. The original RoboCop is probably the only film in the series worth watching. RoboCop 2 did have a lot going for it, but poor film making just ruined it. THe only way to describe RoboCop 2 is...well, a mess. The plot is allover the place. And RoboCop 3, don't even get me started on RoboCop 3. Verdict. RoboCop is by far one of the best films of our time, however the appalling levels of violence is keeping me from giving this film a 10. 8/10." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "I have always been ambivalent towards the films of Paul Verhoeven. In my personal experience, his work has been marred by his excesses. Don't get me wrong; I like sex and violence in movies as much as anyone else, but this guy really overdoes it. His worst film to date, \"Showgirls,\" wallows in sensationalism for its own sake; he includes plenty of nudity but barely any plot to speak of. However, he found a solid middle ground in \"Robocop,\" my favorite of his films thus far. While it contains as much violence as you'd expect (more if you watch the director's cut), it's counterbalanced by a well-crafted storyline, a compelling \"man vs. machine\" theme, and even some social criticism. This is not an entirely serious science-fiction movie. It is as much a social satire as anything else. This aspect of the film is established from the start with the first of many jabs at media and corporate culture. A very cynical view is taken of such institutions, which are seen as corrupt to the core. The satiric elements were necessary to offset the brutality of many scenes. Otherwise, it would have been too bleak and nasty to recommend, a problem that would plague its first sequel. The cold-blooded murder of the protagonist, a dedicated police officer, is extremely graphic and brutal, even for Verhoeven. This scene, and the character's subsequent resurrection as Robocop, is highly riveting. There are other gruesome scenes, sufficiently graphic to originally warrant an X rating from the MPAA. Even now, this comes off as a borderline NC-17 movie. I was intrigued by the central dilemma facing Robocop; although much of his original memory was purged, he still retains enough of his humanity to realize who he is and what's become of him. In one of the most compelling scenes, he accesses the crime database to identify his previous incarnation--and his killers. His mission becomes purely personal, conflicting with his new programming. At one point, he visits his former home (now up for sale), haunted by memories of his past family. He remembers what OCP wanted him to forget; how can he proceed with this newfound knowledge? This type of movie needs a good villain. Kurtwood Smith is more than up to the task; his character, a ruthless drug lord, is extremely vicious and nasty, even for an action villain. In one early scene, he throws his henchman out of a getaway truck just to throw off his pursuers. When he murders Robocop's old human self, he is genuinely enjoying his actions, the mark of a true sadist. In a later scene, Robo returns to give him a good beating, and the scene is one of pure satisfaction to the viewer, as comeuppance is imposed on a character who truly deserves it. Another good supporting performance comes from the solid Nancy Allen as the protagonist's former partner, who is the first to recognize him, and eventually proves to be his salvation. As the title character, Peter Weller is adequate, though countless other performers would have done just as well in the role. Verhoeven's vision of the future is a bleak, dystrophic urban wasteland, a shadow of Detriot's former glory as a major industrial city. At times it even seems like a postapocalyptic setting. He keeps the film moving at a thrill-a-minute pace, yet allows for the human elements of the story to shine through, delivering a movie that is more than just another generic thriller. It's most glaring flaw is not quite knowing how to end. The bad guy bites the dust, and Robocop gets his revenge; yet it isn't quite worthy of what went on before. *** (out of ****) Released by Orion Pictures" "Robocop is way better and more violent than the Terminator. It was very interesting, and more sci-fi than the sequels. But it is a classic, and it's going to stay that way, plus the special effects were pretty good for it's 1987 year and a cheap movie company known as Orion Pictures." "Over the top action comedy is drop dead hilarious such as when Bobby is thrown from the van or Murphy having his hand blown off & when the assistant is shot several by Ed-209.The movie also has funny one liners:''What is this sh*t !''. Rating:***** (out of five)" "Robocop is an awesome movie. It is probably one of the most graphically violent ever. I saw it when I was eight in the theater and for years dreamt of one day making a movie as violent. Sure it has minimal plot and only tolerable acting but you can't get a much more entertaining movie. Dutch director Paul Verhoeven who's directing has also brought us Total Recall and Starship Troopers has his finger on the pulse of what young American males want to see. The extreme violence in this movie is occasionally broken up by moments of sheer brilliant humor. Such as the mock commercials. I'm not a supporter of DVD but my friend has one and he got the director's cut of Robocop for even more violence. Either way this movie rocks." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Robobcop is the greatest film ever. Time travelling robots, car chases, head disasters,guts, killings, excitements, great graphics. As many have reviewed it, I'll give a plot summary and offer my favourite quotings. It's the future. Crime is everywhere, cops are overrun. Bad guys rule the cops. Everyone watches silly TV shows involving cakes and breasts: Bixby: I'd buy that for tree fiddy! Murph joins the cops. On his first day he is murdered by baddies. In an exhilarating chase the baddie boss sacrifices one of his own men:Clarence: Can you fly, Blobby? Smurf catches a couple of the bad guys, but the tables turn when he is outnumbered: Emil: (pointing a shotgun at Murphy) Your hide is mine! Clarence: No. Nat ya da da! Lead baddie Clarence Bodyguard gives his reasons for massacre:Clarence: See, I got this problem, so I do. I don't like cops so I don't. NANANANANANA! (blowing Murphy's hand off) Clarence: Not so handy now, are ya? This is all very amusing so one of the camp bad guys quips: Joe: Ooh I bet that's gotta sting, well you see now that's the thing, 'bout being shot 300 times. Ooh my boys, he speaks, he rhymes! Morse dies while his partner Lewis watches. Campy Joe quips as they leave: Joe: Nighty night, sleep well my friend. Oops, that's right, you're bucking dead! The company which looks after the city's police force, OCD, has been looking for new ways to solve crime. Dick Johns has created a monster called Ed20head which he believes will work. He presents it to the committee in a delightful scenario which reminded me of school drama club: (Kinney points a pistol at ED209) ED: Please put down your weapon. You have 20 seconds to comply. Dick: Do as he says. (Kinney drops the pistol but ED advances) ED: What did I just say, scumbag? Kinney: I did what you said. I did what you said! ED: Oh, back chat me will you? (ED opens fire and shreds Kinney) Dirk's boss is very disappointed at this glitch. Up and comer Bob Monkhouse steps up to the dish and offers his solution- a time travelling robot they captured which can be reprogrammed with the mind of a dead cop. Dick (secretly the crime lord boss) isn't happy. They use Murray's Brain: Bob: You're gonna be a bad mother-crusher! He's unstoppable. All he needs is 12 hours sleep a day, and a special type of robot food: Johnson: Tastes like baby food! Morton: I prefer rusks. He follows set orders: Morton: What are your Prime Directives? Robo: Shooting bad guys in the balls, eating baby food, your clothes, your boots, and your motorcycle. Robo immediately gets to work on killing criminals and saving the day creating his own classic quotes along the way: Robo: You feel lucky, Creep? Well, do ya? Robo: Thank you for your cooperation. Adios! Robo: Dead or alive, you are going to die. He is an internet sensation, bigger than the Beaters: Reporter: Excuse me, Robo, any special message for all the kids watching at home? Robo: Stay away from my bins. Dick's angry that his plan for world domination has been destroyed. He speaks to Bob about respect before having him killed: Dick: I used to call the old man funny names. Smelley pants. Boner. Once I even called him...\"Bum face.\" Murphy has been having nightmares about being killed, and decides to go after the gang: (Dragging Leon Nash by the hair) Robo: Who killed Laura Palmer? This leads to a shootout with motorcycles, helicopters, and sharks in a warehouse: Robo: Come quietly or there will be... trouble. Steve: Oh... yeah? (cocks shotgun)Hasta la vista, baby! (fires) Clarence was celebrating his birthday and is surprised by all the presents: Clarence: Oooh. buns, buns, buns! He isn't happy when Robert arrests him, but knows his rights: Clarence: Just give me my funning phone call. He phones Dick who says Robobo must be killed. He gives Clarence new guns so they can kill Robotinator: Joe: Whoa, a new toy. Can I play? Clarence: Buy your own, hippy. Robo finds them and begins his final confrontation with the help of Louise. Campy Joe is his first victim: Robo: Looking for me? (shoots Joe)Does it hurt? Does it hurt? He drops Emilio into a vat of Toxic Waste (he returns in the sequel as bad guy The Jokey Man): Emil: (after taking an acid bath) It Burns! He kills Clarence and the rest of the gang but Louie is hurt: Lewis: Murphy... I'm a mess... Robo: Soiling oneself is a common problem in earthlings. Robo goes to OCD headquarters to arrest Dick, but can't due to a fourth directive in his database. Dick explains his actions: Dick: I had to kill Bob Morton because he made a mistake. Now it's time to erase that mistake. (Attacks Robo with an eraser on the end of a giant pencil) The Wee Man realises what has been happening: Old Man: Dick, you're fired! (Directive 4 is cancelled) Robo: Dick, you're fired! (shoots Jones) Due to budget constraints the following quote was left in as they couldn't afford to re-film it: Old Man: Nice shooting, son. What's your name? Robo: em. Paul Weller? Best Scene: When Robo sticks the metal blade out of his arm through a robber who dared to steal a carton of milk. It goes through the carton, through bad guy's mouth, and out the back of his head!" "If \"Robocop\" was first released today, it would probably not create much fanfare. However, when it was launched in 1987, \"Robocop\" became a true legend: Everybody had at least heard the term \"robocop\" coined in the synonymous film, a term that gradually became a part of everyday slang. As for the film itself, it proved to be a huge success, it set a new trend in action films, and it was followed by (unfortunately worse) sequels; even a TV series was created featuring Alex Murphy, the famous law enforcing human-machine Robocop. So what was so special about \"Robocop\", back then? Well, the short answer should be \"the innovative story\". The film is about a not-so-distant bleak future (today this future unfortunately looks even closer to us...), in which greed and violence prevail, while the private sector takes care of everything, with its focus being in maximizing its profit instead of serving the public (sounds familiar?). In Detroit, OCP company is in charge of running the police (among other activities), but the crime is still rife, with villain Clarence Boddicker (Smith) spreading terror all around. To this end, the number two of OCP Dick Jones (Cox) presents a powerful robot-policeman named ED209, which promises to solve all the city's problems. However, the presentation of ED209 ends in bloodshed and fails miserably, giving the opportunity to a young OCP executive to present his own project, instead: Robocop. Robocop consists of a human policeman Alex Murphy (Weller) who had been killed in action, and has been re-constructed from scratch by the addition of several mechanical parts to his body and the erasure of his memory. The Robocop project proves to be a huge success, as Robocop manages to pacify the city and become a hero to its citizens. However, there are two problems: The first is that Robocop still has memories of his human past which haunt him; these memories become more intense when his former partner, officer Anne Lewis (Allen), realizes who he is, and she explains the missing gaps to him. The second and far more serious problem is that Jones is not happy at all with the turn of events, and so he is ruthlessly determined to destroy both the Robocop project and its creator. Today the above story might not raise so many eyebrows, but back then, it was a really innovative and exciting script. Verhoeven did a superb direction, with many cool (for 1987 standards) visual effects also stealing the show. However, the film still had a few shortcomings: The acting was just average, while the plot still had room for some more twists and a little less predictability. Nevertheless, the result was good, and despite the film's evident age today, its still gets easily a 7/10."

"SINCE I mentioned 'RoboCop' yesterday in my review of 'Total Recall', I'll delve a bit deeper into it today. As I mentioned before, director Verhoeven expresses his concerns about the power of corporations in this flick, but his main concern is about the robot's ability to regain his humanity. Viewers will know that the cop, Murphy, was killed by white gangsters and then outfitted with a robot's mind and body. However, he begins to have dreams about his past life with his family and these lead him to the realization that he was human. His humanity then bursts through the metal and wires to grab control of his mind, and in the final showdown with the corporate baddies, he knocks them off with ease and maintains his demeanor. In a sidebar, the gangster who conducts the most nefarious killings is a white guy, who is a puppet to the white head honcho. In two popular films in the 1980s, 'Witness' and 'Ghost', the head honchos were whites but the baddies who did the killings were minorities. So, it was a pleasant surprise to see a white baddie doing most of the killings in 'RoboCop'." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, Miguel Ferrer, Kurtwood Smith, Ronny Cox and Dan O'Herlihy star in this 1987 sci-fi/action film. This takes place in Detroit, Michigan where we meet cop, Alex Murphy (Weller) who's just transferred from another department. He meets new partner, Anne Lewis (Allen) and he's killed after they attempt to arrest a vicious gang led by Clarence Boddicker (Smith). Soon, Murphy becomes a cyborg, Robocop ran by company, OCP (Omni Consumer Products) headed by vice president, Bob Morton (Ferrer). Robocop starts getting flashbacks of his family and the gang that killed him. He seeks revenge and goes after Clarence's gang members saving him for last. Meanwhile, Dick Jones (Cox) is a corrupt executive at OCP who hates Bob and has him killed by Clarence. Jones also has a lethal machine, ED 209 that fails at first, but is fixed after. Robocop learns that Clarence is working for Jones and tries arresting Jones, but has to get past ED 209 first. Lewis eventually learns that Robocop is her deceased partner, Murphy and helps him get Clarence and Jones. The late, O'Herlihy (Halloween III: Season of the Witch) plays the old man in charge of OCP. I've always liked this film, Weller & the cast are great as well as Basil Poledouris' score. This is an 80's classic I recommend." "As far as a cop would go sure a robot with the common sense and logical capacity of a human would be handy, especially given the assumed strength and durability of the robot bits. But in the world of superheroes or truly dangerous and formidable foes Robocop sorta just sucks. I mean really over the three films he caps around 25 bad guys and gets absolutely demolished and in need of major repair in every. Single. Film. His major 'skill' is the ability to shoot relatively straight and to deliberately ricochet bullets at certain angles. So trick shots is his superpower basically. Yet if you have the equivalent of an Atari 2600 or similar you could probably hack in and alter his programming so that he might target the weak and innocent, or his own colleagues. I'm pretty sure he'd short circuit if he passed a microwave, and I'd guess he'd be f*cked if he got tasered. All in all quite a sucky hero really. But all that said they ended up making three of these things. And here they are, so without further ado Once upon a time, in a world gone to sh*t Future Detroit is a mess, crime is rampant, poverty everywhere and the privately run police force either outmatched or as crooked as those it should be chasing. The most formidable bad guy out there is Clarence Bodicker, a ruthless killer who reigns supreme over a rag tag bunch or similarly slack-moraled minions. Unfortunately for Murphy (Peter Weller) his first day after being transferred to the most dangerous station in Detroit see him cross paths with Bodicker's bunch and turned into something resembling a rissole in front of his partner Lewis (Nancy Allen). The next day Murphy's still twitching corpse is reanimated and finds integrated into various metal parts that form the chassis of the guy on the poster: Robocop. Robocop is a crime fighting cyborg programmed to uphold the law and unleashed upon a city in dire need of serving and protecting. The early stages of his duty are  as Borat would say  'great success', but after a few days and a few bullets to the head Robo-Murphy starts experiencing glitches, flashbacks, memories things that a robotic being shouldn't have. After a few unfortunate occurrences the human police force turns against ol' Roby and call a strike which leads to even more chaos and disorder than a Sunday morning at the Charlie Sheen household. Can Robocop save the day and differentiate between Murphy and its Cyborg self? You'll have to watch to find out. Robocop hasn't aged well, but it does have a few noteworthy elements. There are frequent clever 'future' ads shown through the film that are filled with very black humour, and some other moments that show how the lust for new technology isn't always for the benefit of society. While exceedingly violent the on screen action features more splatter than gore, meaning although many die in a hail of blood and bullets it really isn't too realistic and upsetting. If anything the more guys that get mown down the more 'meh' it all becomes. The design of Robocop is actually very impressive and he gets to coin a few catchphrases of his own while upholding the law in his own carefully programmed way, even if in reality the question might be asked 'what use is a robot-cop that can still be taken down by gunfire anyway?\" Final Rating  6.5 / 10. Hardly an 80s action landmark when compared to Predator or Die Hard, Robocop was nonetheless a worthwhile film that has dated badly and been superseded by the ultra-violence that it satirised." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Paul Verhoven seems to be an intense guy. I would love to see him direct his version of a Nora Ephron-type romantic comedy. But until then, we need to satisfy ourselves with the world he has created, one of giant bugs and cyborgs and lesbian serial killers and hollow men and Kuatos bursting from a guy's chest, and three-breasted women, and \"Saved By The Bell\" cast member's grinding into Agent Cooper like they're having a fit. Verhoven is an extreme in a world of half measures. Here, he takes what should probably been a simple B movie about a killed cop being made into a half man/half cyborg law enforcement officer and cranks it up (I almost said \"Cranks it to 11\" but I think that has finally stopped being clever for writers to use). He takes the premise and adds a Jesus metaphor to it, and also films the violence so splatterly that the camera must have always had a plastic tarp on it. Peter Weller does wonders wearing a costume that looks like it hurt to wear (it did). He manages to take an unrealistic character and make him very human, so that we are shocked how involved we get in his dilemma of not being a dead man, but not being a live robot either. All Robocop knows is he needs revenge against the gang that (sorta kinda) killed him. Much gore and blood ensue. I have read that this is a satire ofwhat exactly I don't know. Corporate greed, I suppose. If anything, I think it satirizes the conventions of a Charles Bronsan action revenge thriller (while embracing the clichés necessary). I'm not sure Verhoven could even tell you.

Shearer pursued Clarence and the team into an abandoned ware house. Clarence managed to ambush officer shearer and than proceeded to empty his load all over shearers torso along with his fella comrades in crime before finally releasing his final load in shearers face. Clarence knew he did wrong and he was now on the run big time.

Any way Clarence skipped bail and manged to lure robot cop into a scrap yard, here they proceeded to fight it out to the death and unfortunately Clarence took a sneaky stab from robocop to the throat. Clarence died and so did a piece of my heart,the local bad boy done good was butchered by a cop in cold blood. Any way robocop went on to murder his boss by throwing him out the window and is now probably standing trial for double homicide.THE END. Bloody good film how this never won an Oscar for best script i will never know." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "One of the better films from the action packed 80's. Verhoeven's graphic and violent movie of a crime ridden, futuristic Detroit has our cyborg hero pitted against a ruthless crime boss who wants to control the city; and an even more ruthless corporation (OCP) which owns and runs the police department. The film is well paced and entertaining, and uses dark humour and irony to good effect. Definite highlight is the action sequence in the cocaine warehouse. Special effects are also impressive. Watch for ED 209. Still a fan of the unstoppable, I loved watching Robocop strut his stuff. Wednesday, May 20, 1992 - Video Verhoeven's violent, near future vision of Detroit works well as an action film even on return viewing. The action sequences are very well put together (the highlight), and special effects are convincing indeed. Mr. Verhoeven's graphic style, which spoilt \"Basic Instinct\", suits this film down to the ground. The movie's narrative keeps you interested, and if you like unstoppable cops, then this film is for you. Saturday, September 19, 1992 - Video" "Before I saw this movie, I saw at least one of the sequels and maybe both. Whatever I have seen, one detail stood out in my mind: the humanity and caring nature of 'Robocop', who was remembering his life as a human. So I figured I could enjoy this movie. Of course, it was too violent for my taste, but I did have several favorable impressions. In this movie, the cop whose brain was used for 'Robocop' kept the memories that made him 'human', though his past did not make a strong impression at first. ED-2000 was a pleasure to watch (except when its actions resulted in violence) because of the primitive but well-done animation, which was obviously animation. I didn't think I would like Kurtwood Smith as a genuinely bad person, but he was deliciously evil and a real treat to watch. His talent for comedy came through here. But I prefer it when he is just being cruel to teenagers who, deep down, he really cares about." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "You may be thinking how can this guy like robocop better than terminator.MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD well I first saw this movie when I was 7 and it was the most violent and most action filled movie I had ever seen.the film has everything action, comedy and even drama.my favourite scene is when ED-209 kills Kinney, It is funny and gruesome ( Only Paul Verhoeven and the monty python cast can do that IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE, SEE IT NOW!!!!!! 10/10" "Without doubt, one of the best 'boy' action movies of all time. The graphic violence and lame cliches make this movie (set in the 'near future') somewhat predictable, but the quality of the action puts it into an exclusive league. This movie doesn't have any pretentious views on the world, it just makes fun of everyone. If you enjoyed Die Hard and The Terminator, I suggest you watch this movie. If Remains of the Day is more your style - avoid. Best line (From the drunk at the Police Station): \"I'm what you call a repeat offender. I repeat, I will offend again.\" Best Concept: The commercials used to intro the news breaks - I want a copy of 'Nukem' for Christmas!" "Jorgie, what are you thinking? How is the Terminator a wannabe, yet it was released 3 years before? Wow. Anyway, this movie is pretty good, but all the sequels sucked. I'd certainly still take the Terminator over Robocop any day, but if you're not in the mood to watch Terminator, get T2:Judgement Day."

"I would have to say, RoboCop is the most violent movie of all-time. The violence of other Sci-Fi and Action films were no match for this one, the scene where Peter Weller's character Murphy gets killed slowly is the most unbearable scene for me. I could accept violent deaths like Impaling, Decapitation and other causes of death as long as it's quick and it's the bad guy who's dying. But there's nothing compared to this especially when I lately discovered in the internet that there was a symbolism of Christ's crucifixion in Murphy's death scene. And I would have nightmares on that death scene dreaming that it was me getting shot and killed slowly, anyway the plot is dark and has black humor on it. The movie is an instant classic becoming the most violent film ever made, so violent that there was one true story in my home country where a 9 year old boy was watching this film but his maid wants to watch a TV show which made the kid angry ending up shooting her. RoboCop 2 was a dud but RoboCop 3 did a good job finishing the trilogy despite making it a PG-13 rating (which I really did appreciate too) and Peter Weller's departure for the title role. In closing what I have shared to you in my movie review and the true story that I've told all I could say is...\"Stay out of trouble.\"" "People get killed so horribly in this movie that it's nothing short of hilarious. Except Murphy, of course. That scene is just sadistic and a little upsetting to be honest. It's even worse uncut, trust me. But when you have Red \"You Dumbass!\" Foreman as a brutal thug/killer, you know you can't go wrong. In fact, I'd put him up on a top twenty list of screen villains, he's that much of a bastard. This movie is violent. Did I mention that? Whether or not you've seen this, try to get your hands on the uncut version if you can. It's among the more brutal examples of cinema expression I can think of. The scene where ED-209 goes berserk and kills an OCP exec is extended and it's not like if he wasn't shot enough in the theatrical version. No, here they shoot him to the point that you start looking at your watch in disbelief. Verhoeven is one wacked-out Dutchman! I'm surprised he didn't play Goldmember come to think of it. Let the shoosting begin!!! This is a great comic-book style movie and I think fans of the genre know better than to let this one go by unnoticed. Rating **** out of *****." "This is a better film than you will remember. As a writer, I know how hard it is to end a really good piece, and as a film student, I'm coming to understand the pressures that a film producer is likely to place on talent. As such, I can forgive the film for my one beef, which is that the ending somewhat tempers the film. Robocop is an impressive, important piece of science-fiction satire, dealing with the definition of humanity on one level, but also, as the plot turns about, taking on deeper and more Shakespearian themes of ruthless self-advancement, dark times, mixed morality, and, in the form of Robocop's Prime Directives, absolute honor. (Those who would protest Verhoeven's level of violence I'd ask to attend an opera.) After a wonderful plot was set up, right up to the third act, however, a far too light and simple ending was presented. It seemed almost as if the film ran out of time and had to rush a wrap-up through production. In the process, Robocop and his lovely, mad world got short changed. Fortunately, it was not enough to kill a really great film. This is a true classic, and not to be missed." "One OF The Best Science Fiction Movies Ever.Non Stop Action And Gore.Peter Weller Plays Well As Robocop And Kurtwood Smith And Ronny Cox play well as the villains. The Story is Peter Weller Gets Bumped off by a gang of killers and is transformed into Robocop. watch out creeps your going to be done. Jack Foreman" "'Robocop' never seems to get much of the praise of other big budget (or even medium budget) sci-fi/action films of the 1980s and early 1990s. Terminator, Blade Runner, Videodrome, and the like are frequently raised as examples of both visual quality and politically grounded narratives. But why has Robocop generally ceded to the background? It may be less visually adept as some of its predecessors (and the stop-action animation may even have been nearing obsoleting), but the film itself appears to be a bleak allegory of America--one inundated with a habitually violent and consumerist culture, and forewarns of the privatization of public services as well as the unpleasant battle of Man and his increasingly sophisticated technological artifacts. The film takes place in Old Detroit, a run down city with a serious crime problem. So much so that the regular police force seems ill-equipped to manage it. And, this spread of uncontrollable violence appears to be an epidemic (listen to the lady who said she was going somewhere on vacation, but the place was in the middle of an invasion). Their desperation for a silver lining comes in the form of robotic cops that a technology company, seeking to introduce their designs into the police department of Old Detroit and eventually gain military contracts thereafter. But, within the company, two high level executive rivals compete with one another, although the design of Robocop obviously wins out over the Star Wars looking prop. So, throw your civil rights out the window, there's a new sheriff in town. But, Robocop of course has been programmed by man is susceptible to the control of the rivaling executives and that is to the benefit of one who is in cahoots with a notorious gang." "Pretty good yarn about a cop in the future who's left for dead by some bad guys. He's resurrected by technology and becomes Robocop, a mixture of technology and humanity. His one-time partner, played by Nancy Allen, eventually recognizes him (he has a rather distinctive jaw) and, after he's hurt rather badly again, she nurses him back to health. I found it pretty entertaining and I think Nancy Allen is incredibly cute. So I was probably predisposed to like this." "Considering it was 1987, there was a lot of stuff, most of it gory, that would have been censored in most other movies with similar scenes. You can often tell in other movies that they do things as to lower the rating like not showing certain things. NOT HERE. If they wanted to show you something, you saw it. That was what really made me like the movie compared to other movies this type." "In the near future, the city of Detroit is overrun by a corporation called \"OCP\" (Omni Consumer Products) whom also run the local police station. The city has too much crime and corruption going on especially cop-killers, the corporation decides to make a special program for the police with a new kind of special technology for them. Newcomer officer Alex J. Murphy (Peter Weller) with his partner Ann Lewis (Nancy Allen) pursue a vicious gang of cop-killing criminals led by Clerence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith), but during an attempted arrest Boddicker and his crew mutilates Murphy to pieces. Luckily the OCP is working on a special cybernetic cop program as they use Murphy's former dead corpse for their Frankenstein-esquire experiment that makes him into a technologically advanced cyborg with special bulletproof and bomb-proof metal and a need to protect the innocent and stop evil. He becomes a sensation towards the public, the media and even the other police officers but underneath that fancy armor memories of his past suddenly trigger especially of his execution as he seeks revenge on those that murdered him. OCP co-chairman Dick Jones (Ronny Cox) along with Boddicker join forces together as they come up with a plan to eliminate Robocop. A brutally violent, stylish and highly energized yet entertaining Sci-fi action epic that is Paul Verhoeven's masterpiece. This became the director's U.S. debut movie and is a perfect mix of action, sci-fi and dark comedy thrown into it with some social satire that has made this a critically acclaimed and very popular movie. The violence and gore especially the infamous death of Murphy is so over the top that it nearly got an X rating but was cut down to get an R rating into theaters, the film co-stars Miguel Ferrer and Daniel O'Herihy. The acting is quite good, the music score by Basil Poledouris is superb and the make-up effects and Robocop effects by Rob Bottin and Phil Tippet are out of this world, it's an unforgettable movie that is one of Sci-fi's greatest motion pictures.

"Good science-fiction films are hard to come by. Films set in a bleak future are not. And yet Robocop effectively combines those two sub-genres and ends up being what is quoted to be \"the best science-fiction film since Metropolis.\" Although I haven't seen Metropolis, I know that Robocop is not the greatest science-fiction film in the last 50 years. Merely, it is a mediocre film, with cliché characters, a confusing plot with generic evil corporate bosses with basic names...the list goes on and on. What saves Robocop is just that-Robocop. He's probably the coolest fictional character ever created (well, either him or Grimace from McDonald's). Either way, it's the pure cool factor of Robocop that puts the movie from mediocrity to something to be remembered. Police officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is brutally shot to death by thugs in a not-to-distant future Detroit, where a company's going to provide the police force with robots for cops. The prototype that's brought out screws up, so they decide to make Murphy into the title character. He's now Robocop, a cop that kicks ass and takes names, but has memories of his demise still lodged into his head. He decides to go out for revenge, as the company tries to kill him so they can put their robot on the market. As I said before, the action's just mediocre. There's some shooting and everything, but done generically. The best part isn't the action, thankfully. It's when there's stuff happening outside the action with Robocop. When he goes out to stop crime. He stops a rape by shooting a man in the genitals, which basically goes THROUGH the woman's dress. No human could do that, only the epitome of cool could: Robocop. And Weller does a great job as the stone-faced cop, with just the little bit of emotion. Nancy Allen is the token hard-assed female on the force, who acts like she's in an 80's movie, so I guess that's OK. The film as a whole is never boring-Paul Verhoeven keeps everything rolling for it's short-but-sweet runtime, and I liked all of the pre-Starship Troopers attacks on America-\"Get them before they get you!\" I also liked what Verhoeven did with portraying Robocop as a modern day Jesus-it worked effectively. So the movie works for the most part-any time where Robocop is on the screen. If you can get past the generic feel of the rest of the movie, and just watch for Robocop, you'll love it. My rating: 7/10 Rated R for strong violence and language." "In Detroit of the \"near future\" crime is getting out of hand and the police are being killed left and right. A corporation (OCP) is hired to develop machines that would replace police. Officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is viciously killed in the line of duty. He is brought back to life as Robocop--half machine and half man with no memory of his human life. But then he starts to remember and goes after the people who killed him. Director Paul Verhoeven's blockbuster hit of 1987 isn't really all that good. It does have good things about it--there's some very funny but pitch black humor; parodies of TV commercials and news; great stop motion animation; plenty of blood and violence and LOTS of shootouts. That's the main problem--this movie is TOO loud and seems more interested in violence than in a coherent plot (there are loopholes galore). There has to be at least 5 huge gunfights here which just go on forever. Also the violence gets far too graphic--Weller's torture and killing just goes way overboard. The acting doesn't matter too much--violence is all this movie has to offer. Weller is OK, Allen is terrible but Ronny Cox and Kurtwood Smith have a lot of fun in their roles. A lot of people like this for the virtual nonstop action and violence but it tired me down after a while and the one interesting aspect of the plot (Murphy remembering his life as a human) isn't given enough time to really develop. Also the plot loopholes get increasingly noticeable after a while...for instance, how did Cox get that directive #4 installed in Robocop's system when he had nothing to do with its creation? It's mentioned that OCP is under some corporation--what corporation? Still, if you're looking for mindless blood, violence and destruction this IS your movie. Great ending too. I give it a 7. Also take a VERY close look at the statement after the closing credits--there's a funny little line snuck in there."

"*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Robocop is an amazing movie! Alex J. Murphy/Robocop(Peter Weller) is killed by notorious criminals and he is later reconstructed as Robocop. The movie is extremely gory and is very well made. It has a great story for an action movie. It is cool to see Robocop slowly regain some of his humanity and memories which leads to him taking revenge. The music score is fantastic and really feels right for the movie. The look of Robocop is very original. The special effect hold up very well. It also has some of the best movie lines ever. Robocop is an action movie hero that is one of a kind. Robocop is a movie that deserves to be called a classic. It's over the top, well made, and a perfect movie." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Robocop is one of those films where you have to have the right mindset when watching it, if you're expecting this to be an amazing movie then you'll be surely disappointed but if you're expecting fun, well then it delivers. Robocop tells the story of Alex Murphy who's a cop, in the first twenty or so minutes of the movie he gets shot and killed, in what is a pretty violent death. Eventually Alex get's reborn again but not as a human but instead as a cyborg to help keep crime off the city streets, this is basically the whole plot to the movie. It's a movie that has a simple plot with little to no character development but yet you can't help but love it. As I said earlier the story in the film is simple, but that doesn't mean its bad. Robocop may not have a good story but it does work for what it is, Robocop mainly skips on the story though and just delivers action and blood which for a movie like this, I'm not going to complain. Robocop does get cheesy at times but that's what makes this fun, it has a lot of one liners and quotable lines. The acting in the film is pretty solid, I can't really complain about them seeing how the movie is from the 80's and some of the action is expected to come off as cheesy. All the actors make best with what they have to work with. I think Robocop is just one of those movies you should have fun with and not try picking apart, it does get cheesy at times but it's a movie from the 80's so its almost expected. If you want a movie that's fun, has lots of blood, and explosions then you'll enjoy this." "I just got done watching Robocop and i have to admit it kept me interested the whole time. The blood splattering in this movie was top notch. Robocop (Murphy) seems to me to be a more friendly terminator and without an Austrian accent. I wouldn't say this movie is for everyone. I have always enjoyed an old school action movie so its not a far stretch for me to be entertained by this movie. I will definitely be watching this again.No doubt in my mind! But just for people with weak stomachs...if your not ready for exploding body parts then stay away from my boy Robocop! In this day and age Detroit needs robocop to clean up the streets. Sincerely, Beast from the southeast" "I saw Robocop when it was theatrically released in 1997 (I was then 20 years old), and while I loved it, I was as conflicted about it then as I am now. Which is to say that I was very, very conflicted. Robocop is a reprehensible piece of work and it's also one of my favorite movies. The tension between loathing and adoration is probably what makes it memorable to me, more than the film's admittedly striking visual and intellectual content. Basically, Robocop is an ultra-vicious splatter movie dressed up as a dystopian science-fiction satire. It presents a relentlessly bleak, thuggish and superficial future world where capital controls society to such an extent as to resemble a form of economic fascism. The plot centers on the struggle between what remains of Murphy, a murdered police officer, part of whose brain has been used as material in the construction of the titular law-enforcement robot, and OCP, the giant, shadowy mega-corporation that has privatized the police department. Paul Verhoeven (The 4th Man, Starship Troopers) directs from a script by Michael Miner and Edward Neumeier (Starship Troopers) with his customary technical skill and taste for brutally black comedy. In many ways Robobop is Verhoeven's ultimate statement on the toxic wasteland of American culture, his primary theme since abandoning his native Netherlands. He presents the viewer with a vision of a violent, stupid, media-saturated society, and berates viewers for their complicity with that society. This would not be so terribly unique a position take, but for one brilliant stroke on Verhoeven's part: he makes movies that present themselves, too, as extensions of the society he criticizes. Which is to say that all of his American movies have been explicitly `American movies' - autocritical devices that function as examples of that on which they purport to comment. They are cold, stupid, brutal affairs that express nothing so clearly as their loathing for any audience that might enjoy them. At the same time, they subtly or explicitly subvert their superficial grotesquerie by commenting on the social milieu in which they take place. Thus both Robocop and Starship Troopers not only resemble bad American television shows, they explicitly present themselves as bad American television shows, complete with advertisements and vacuous `news briefs.' Robocop is especially ruthless with regard to its audience, subjecting viewers to a dizzying, non-stop assault of violent spectacle. It veers back and forth between amusingly arch comic-book violence and nauseatingly graphic brutality, pulling the audience in with the comfortable spectacle of well-executed action movie derring-do, and then punishing viewers for enjoying it by subjecting them to incredibly drawn-out and grisly scenes of torture and mutilation. On one level, Robocop obviously wants to comment on and criticize the senseless, inconsequential brutality of American action cinema, but to that end it luxuriates in it's critic's license by hyperextending it's own representations of violence to previously unimaginable extremes. Sitting through Robocop for the first time (especially, I imagine, in it's new, vastly bloodier \"director's cut\" edition) is a profoundly disturbing and desensitizing experience. This is not necessarily a problem. Much of the 20th century's greatest art is profoundly disturbing, and Robocop never allows its violence to function as simpleminded \"thrills\". It humanizes the violence it seems to celebrate, reminding the audience at every turn that pain and terror are integrally linked to \"action.\" To complicate matters, however, it intentionally undercuts it's own critique, constantly letting the audience off the hook by supplying a horrific joke or a swashbuckling uplift to deflate our revulsion when the horror becomes too much to bear. Robocop wants to have it's cake and eat it too, criticizing the conventions of American action movies as an emblem of the vacant blackness at the center of the American soul, but also reveling in the undeniable joys of the action movie format for the sake of turning a buck at the box office. This is certainly a valid approach, and Verhoeven may be congratulated for eschewing a puritan didacticism in his critique. But as with Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers, one is left with the suspicion that for all the intellectual dazzle and political posturing, there is something horribly manipulative and heartless about the sensibility at work behind the film. That the movie is not fundamentally the autocritical device it purports to be, but merely a nihilistic bellow of rage and disgust, a self-important tirade against an audience for which the filmmaker feels nothing but contempt. Even worse, I worry that deep down Robocop (like NBK) is nothing but cynical moneymaking ploy, dressed up in the sheep's clothing of subversive intent to blunt the edge of critical assault. You can't really bring yourself to fault Robocop for it's cynicism, ugliness, and cruelty, after all, because it pretends to be merely holding a mirror up to our American soul. And who could fault so noble an intent, even as we watch Verhoeven walk away, laughing, hand in hand with Joe Eszterhas (author of Verhoeven's Basic Instinct and Showgirls) and great big bag of nice, green money." "This movie isn't exactly the most unique of it's kind, although it does have some original aspects. However, Robocop does entertain on many different levels. Firstly, the action in this movie is very enjoyable and is nothing too over-the-top, although some people may argue me on that, and yes is does push censors for an R-rated, non horror movie to be this gruesome at times. The story in this movie is also something more than you're classic shoot-em' up cops and robbers movie, it adds an element of philosophy in the ideas of humanity and poses the question of where does one draw the line between robot and human? Not only is this a question posed, but it is a reoccurring issue throughout. Another angle this movie takes on is the idea of man's desire for control over man by a newer means; technology. Extending from this is the idea of how much control man has over machine (an element we've seen in so many movies before, and after) and can a machine actually perform the functions of a human being with the obvious lack of emotionable ability. Throw in some quality acting, great directing, a cool cyborg, another cool robot with big guns, more big guns and a wickedly evil Red Foreman and you've got a movie that shimmers the light of hope in a dismal future and a Hollywood classic." "I first saw this movie years ago and didn't remember it too well so I saw it again recently and I thought the movie was really horrid. Most of the violence to me is very bad. Very was little of it was necasasary. The guy getting hit by the car after being in a bunch of toxic chemicals had no point except to show something gross. The idea of this movie is nice and shows a great view of the world in the future. Otherwise I think this movie is overrated. 3/10" "ROBOCOP (1987) ***1/2 Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, Ronny Cox, Kurtwood Smith, Dan O' Herlihy. Sci-fi actioner from director Paul Verhoeven paints a nifty portrait of the future set for a world of violence, corporate take overs and lastly a gang of murderous thugs who kill a Detroit policeman and used as the force's special projects group pet project of assembling a law enforcement cyborg (Weller in a humdinger of a role) to serve and protect the public good. Sly satire with a dash of comic book non-chalant gore makes a diverting entertaining flick. Best line: after baddie Smith disables human-for-the-moment Weller the fallen officer retorts \"Buddy... I think you're slime!\"" "An entertaining movie with plenty of action and gratuitous breasts (bar scene) but something interesting caught my attention: A possible low key slam at Pontiac by Ford via the writers? Here is my logic: The OCP officers drove futuristic Ford Taurus police cars, correct? Normally car manufacturers provide cars to movie makers for advertising purposes, though I didn't see an acknowledgment in the credits. Thus the potential for sponsor influence. I know, without the acknowledgment it is a bit of a stretch, but bear with me. There were numerous references to the \"6000SUX\" gas guzzling car, including the cute commercial by the CHIODO Bros. What relevance is this? The number 6000. Robocop was released in 1987. The Ford Taurus hit the streets in 1986 and it's main competitor was Pontiac's \"6000.\" 6000 SUX... 6000 sucks? Subliminal suggestion? Are the writers that clever? Food for thought, but funny if true..." "I don't mind violence...but the Robocop Director's Cut is mind boggling. Murphy's death is violent enough in the released version. In the X, it is very disturbing. It made me want to jump into the screen and punish those guys in the most horrific ways just to let them know how FUBAR they really were. For die-hard Robo fans, do not waste the $35-$40 it costs just to be grossed out. The R-rated version is fine just the way it is. It is also so bad, that after Kurtwood Smith and Ray Wise (Clarence and Leon) saw the screening, they said that they pleaded with Paul Verhoeven to tone it down since they didn't want to be forever linked as the psycho killers in Robocop. It took awhile; but luckily for their career sakes they have gone on to do other stand-out performances that sometimes for the regular film-TV viewer, they don't automatically associate them as the former." "You know I was only 2 years old when this movie was released and my parents said they actually let me watch it when I was 4 years old when it was released? My sister always teased them about how they wouldn't let me watch other movies with little violence or just a little nudity, but they'd let me watch Robocop? Well, they took it to heart, I never saw Robocop again, figuring now that I'm 21, maybe I have a right to see it on my own and may I say that this was a true action flick and a definite cliché of all action movies of the 80's, gotta love them. Murphy is a cop, but when he goes to bust a drug and weapon scandal going on, he gets brutally shot that automatically kills him, but OCP, the police organization he works for have been looking for a cop that doesn't rest or can be killed while being on the job, they take Murphy's body and turn him into Robocop! A machine that acts like a cop and performs the duties of one, but he starts to go haywire when he has flashbacks of Murphy's memories and there may be a traitor in the police force! While Robocop is one of the most unrealistic movies you will ever see in your life, it was all in good fun. I have to say that I have never heard a more useless way of the F Word like I did in Robocop, but that was so funny! Not to mention I loved the death out the window! It's not a true 80's action flick without a death out the window. If you are looking for a movie to take seriously, don't watch it, but for good fun, just please get the popcorn and have a good time! 7/10" "Add another review" "Find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your Watchlist and rate your favorite movies and TV shows on your phone or tablet!")("Movies, TV & Showtimes" "Celebs, Events & Photos" "News & Community" "Watchlist" "" "Find industry contacts & talent representation" "Manage your photos, credits, & more" "Showcase yourself on IMDb & Amazon" "Sign in with Facebook Other Sign in options" "Own the rights?" "It's a shame that this movie wasn't done better because there's a lot of potential because the story is great. But unfortunately this movie was done in the 1980's which means you're stuck with cheesy, over-the-top acting, mediocre effects (though I'm sure they were at least typical when the film was made), and the same crappy directing that plagued so many films in the era. I think there's a lot of potential to the story and the human element and internal conflict of the RoboCop/Murphy character but the film largely skims right past most of that focusing more on needless side clips of a setting that was never established or non-critical villains. I'm interested to see the reboot version and hoping they go the direction so many other films in this generation of action movies have gone... dark, realistic, and gritty. If you gave this concept to Christopher Nolan, you'd have an amazing movie. Hopefully the reboot can be everything the original wasn't. Now it sounds like I'm being really hard on the movie and yet I gave it a 7/10 so what gives? Well, it was still a good movie, even with all the minor negatives, because the story has so much potential and even with the poor execution it manages to pull you in." "\"RoboCop\" has not aged gracefully. The action sequences seem stagey and flat in this post-\"Matrix\" age, and the clay animated ED209 now looks more like a \"Wallace & Gromit\" villain than a fearsome metallic menace. The violence is indulgent and over-the-top, the women all have silly '80s hair, and the main villain is the Dad from \"That '70s Show.\" The whiskers on this movie are about a mile long. Aside from that, though, it's pretty good. Ronny Cox is an engaging bad guy, often picking up the slack when the rest of the movie is falling down around him, and his final defeat is one of the cleverest gimmicks I've ever seen in a movie. The social satire is entertaining, but ultimately quite predictable; don't all sci-fi movies predict that marketing will become infinitely more obnoxious in the future? I have mixed praise for Robocop himself; he's got personality and he's easy to root for, but why is Murphy so much cooler as a cyborg than as a human? He had to die to acquire a shred of charisma! At the end of the day, this is dated but fun - and it's nowhere near a masterpiece. The Criterion Collection must've released this movie on an off day, when they couldn't get the rights to something better." "I will admit I would have probably given this film a couple more stars back in the day. It was popular because it was different. A new, somewhat original concept is always embraced excitedly. But our attention to detail and critical eyes have evolved since the eighties. There's no chance this movie could survive with such high ratings if it had been a new release in this generation of film. Even if it'd been lavishly souped with our great special effects of the day. The utter absurdity that was the violence in this film is laughable. People shot so heavily and so continuously and still they live? Even if they die, they die so dramatically it's ridiculous. I finally had to completely suspend all belief to finish this film, and simply embrace it's whole-hearted science-fictional ways. 'Okay, so this is a world where people don't die like real people do. Cool. There are robots running around. I can handle it.' Still, after making such an adjustment, it failed, sadly, to make the movie good. They spent all their time developing the effects and less time with the story and characters. That's not to say they did NO work. I liked the female lead. She was cool. But there wasn't enough of her. Robo was cool, too. But I could have used a little more of developing the male lead and a little less of the pointless time spent developing the robot. The rest of this fantasy world was just hopped up on a whole lot of crazy and I couldn't care one hill of beans about how it turned out. I knew how it was going to end, but the process of getting me there left me seriously wanting. I gave it three stars because I thoroughly enjoyed seeing my surly 'That '70s Show' father, Kurtwood Smith, playing a bad guy." "The first movie of the popular \"RoboCop\" series is considered to be the best of them and a masterpiece of science fiction. While it is really original and has strong message, it is too gory (and I say this being a horror-fan), chaotic and unpleasant to watch. The main character, RoboCop is very interesting and the villain is really ghastly and memorable, but the bad robot looks very stupid and the film is full with scenes of sadistic violence, which made it tough to watch. Unlike the sequels, the first RoboCop is considered to be a \"serious scifi\", but it's neither good nor as enjoyable as the best movie in the cyborg genre - The Terminator." "i was just wondering if RoboCop ever felt sexual longing for women. anyone care to respond? if there is a part where he displays (i'll even allow references from the less-enjoyable sequels) such a characteristic, tell me where it is, because i certainly missed it. another funny thing i noticed is that the actor who plays Joe Cox is named Jesse Goins. add an 'r' after the 'G' and what does it spell? i thought that was humorous." "A surprisingly nasty and off-putting action film from 1987. \"RoboCop\" is set in a near future where corporations are creating robotic sentinels to help fight rampant crime. One such creation haywires and runs amok. Enter RoboCop, created when a police officer (Peter Weller) is killed in the line of duty and resurrected as a part human/part robotic commando. An intelligent screenplay would have used this set up to explore some moral questions about man vs. machine, or nature vs. mechanization. At the very least it would have explored the psyche of Weller's character a bit more, examining the act of killing from the point of view of someone who's neither completely human nor completely mechanical. But this isn't an intelligent film, so it opts instead to wallow in sadistic and graphic violence. By the end of the film, whole scenes are being set up for the sole purpose of seeing people be flayed, dismembered, immersed in toxic waste and killed in other splatter-porn variations. It's a film that invites you to enjoy it as a bit of escapism and then makes it difficult to have much fun with it. Stephen Flick and John Pospicil received a special achievement Academy Award for their Sound Effects Editing, and the film received two competitive nominations that it did not win: Best Film Editing (Frank J. Urioste) and Best Sound (Michael J. Kohut, Carlos de Larios, Aaron Rochin and Robert Wald). Grade: C-" "I would recomend this movie to people but not all.The reason this movie isn't great is it is very very gory.It also has a lot of drug use and other stuff.But other then those things it is a good action film.I would give this a 6.5 out of ten and recomend it to action fans but be warned it is a gory film." "I guess I'm going to be the outcast here and say this movie was a major disappointment in just about every category. I watched the Criterion version, OOP and therefore expensive, and simply don't get it. What qualifies this to be nominated for Oscars? If this one claims Oscars, then there is simply no award that would do justice to 'The Terminator'. OK, let me not compare this to any other movie. How does it weigh on its own? The dialogue - agonizingly flaky and juvenile. The FX - blasé. The storyline - predictable to the end. The acting - remarkably unremarkable. To its credit, there were about 5 minutes of film that stood apart from the rest. The 'robot demo' at the executive meeting, and Murphy's bloody demise. The savagery in both cases was well captured and made a point. Everything else was script-out-of-a-can, acting-out-of-a-can, plot-out-of-a-can, etc. For e.g., how does Robocop prove its battle-worthiness on the mean streets? By foiling a convenience store holdup and a rape. These 2 scenes were so tired and clichéd - they're standard procedure in just about every cop and robber movie ever made. There's a lot of discussion and appreciation in these forums about the 'humanity' of Robocop. OK, so he forgets his folks, but figures out their/his address from a computer and wanders through his abandoned old house, and is programmatically unable to enforce the law on his creators. I'm sorry, but for me, that's hardly a portrait in humanity. C'mon folks, if you look real hard for something, you'll likely wind up imagining its there. If it had the least shred of humanity, for example, it wouldn't go letting loose its guns for target practice when its partner (who rescued it, btw) is sleeping just a few feet away, dog-tired. The ending was completely predictable and unworthy of any subsequent contemplation. Its hard to not compare this unworthy conclusion to a real one-of-a-kind classic - The Terminator. The conclusion there was nothing but humanity, as best a machine could manifest. It was a conclusion that made me reflect, and feel, and imagine, long after the movie was over. In closing - I am not saying that this was a lousy movie - For it's time (1987) it was OK. I am saying that this is a vastly over-hyped movie that simply does not do justice to the accolades it has gathered. It is as good a movie as Tango and Cash, or Black Rain, or Dirty Harry. There is much better scifi out there - like the Alien series, The Terminator, The Matrix, Donnie Darko, etc., and what the heck - even Disney's Tron. That Criterion picked this to represent a high point of scifi cinematic accomplishment - is simply unfathomable. This gesture is not just a matter of conferring unwarranted and unworthy credit, it is additionally an affront to the real giants of scifi that have carved their names forever in cinema, our hearts, and our consciousness." "When I first saw this almost 20 years ago, I thought it was one of the most violent movies I'd ever seen. It may still be ranked as such, despite 20 more years of violent films. Much of it, at least in the first half of the film, is entertaining but it gets just too carried away with cartoon-like villains and overdone violence. I think what bothered me was that it looked like a film geared to attract kids, even with the R rating and millions of kids did indeed watch this. The villains are so outlandishly bad you almost have to laugh. Ronny Cox has to be one of the best actors and being someone the audience hates and Daniel O'Herlily isn't far behind in that category. Like many other, I like a good crime/science fiction film but this was just too nasty, too hard-edged and needlessly profane. What the movie needs is more humor in place of all the overdone shooting and profanity. It would have made it much better." "Sorry to say that RoboCop just didn't do it for me. If they were trying to be over the top and ridiculous, they failed. The film was kind of slow and to be completely honest, boring. It wasn't too silly, although the humor seemed kind of...blunt. The acting is fine, although some characters only succeed in being annoying. The effects are fine for the 80s, but the action is not very entertaining. I was just underwhelmed. I know that \"The Terminator\" is a very different sort of film, but as far as Cyborgs go, the movie and the character Terminator are a hell of a lot cooler and better. Anyway, enough of my ranting. Maybe I missed something, since many seem to like this film a lot. I personally didn't. 3/10, I would avoid."

"*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "From director Paul Verhoeven (Total Recall, Basic Instinct, Starship Troopers), I remember watching this film a few times when I was younger, but I could only remember certain moments, so in my older days I had to see it again. Basically in the not too distant future in Detroit, the city is ridden with crime, and the police department have been bought out by Omni Consumer Products (OCP), so the staff are going on strike. While Officer Alex J. Murphy (Peter Weller) has been transferred from Metro South to the West and partnered with Officer Anne Lewis (Carrie's Nancy Allen) the large corporate company taking over, run by senior president Dick Jones (Total Recall's Ronny Cox), are trying to find new ways to lower crime rate, and they have developed new robot ED-209 that goes wrong before it can even go into action. While Murphy and Lewis are trying to track down a gang of criminals, led by Clarence J. Boddicker (Dead Poets Society's Kurtwood Smith), the group beat up and shoot Murphy dead. One of the OCP employees makes another law enforcement robot to rival with Jones, with Murphy's corpse he transforms him into and creates RoboCop, a crime fighting machine with three prime directives: serve the public trust, protect the innocent, and uphold the law. For a good amount of time RoboCop proves himself as a worthy force for good and a great machine to clean up crime, with his gun skills, his ability to avoid injury, and his unrelenting attitude, but having the brain Murphy still inside him he is having flashes from his former life as a human. He is seeing flashes from when he was killed, more so after an encounter with one of the criminals, and flashes also include his life with his family, but with what is coming back to him he is finding a way to catch the gang and possibly have the chance to take revenge. Obviously Boddicker realises he is wanted by RoboCop, and Lewis recognised that it was Murphy inside the body of the robotic cop, and when he tries to kill the one bossing the gang, Jones, he discovers a fourth directive he was unaware of, that he cannot arrest or harm people who work at OCP. After a damaging encounter with the villain of the piece Murphy has pretty much completely remembered who he is, and with Lewis they hide out in a place the criminals will be gathering, taking of his mask, and ultimately getting his vengeance by killing them, and especially Boddicker. In the end RoboCop returns to OCP to prove that Jones is a criminal, and it is only after he is \"fired\" by the villain's higher in the company that RoboCop can kill Jones, and he walks away assuring the company he will surely carry on fighting crime. Also starring Miguel Ferrer as Bob Morton, Daniel 'Dan' O'Herlihy as The Old Man, Robert DoQui as Sergeant Warren Reed, Ray Wise as Leon C. Nash, Felton Perry as Johnson and Paul McCrane as Emil M. Antonowsky. The acting is good for all the parts, especially of course the leading star creating a magnificent cyborg police officer with mime like characteristics, the film is full of interesting ideas of how to create a \"perfect\" world, little pointers about the power of promotion and advertising, and niggles on social issues, and of course the sometimes comic violence and special effects really make this a fantastic satirical science-fiction action thriller. It won the Oscar for the Special Achievement Award for sound effects editing, and it was nominated for Best Film Editing and Best Sound, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Make Up Artist and Best Special Effects. Very good!" "'RoboCop' represents a low point in '80s sci-fi cinema. The acting is laughable, the plot redundant, and the dialogue stale. I suppose the film was intended to be brain candy, but its sheer unpleasantness causes it to fail even in this respect. The fun factor is further reduced by the movie's almost unbearably annoying villains who, for whatever reason, find it necessary to giggle with girlish glee whenever they kill or threaten someone. A stupid, pointlessly violent, and thoroughly unenjoyable movie. If you're looking for an enjoyable cyborg flick, this ain't it. Try 'The Terminator' or 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day' instead." "Leaving aside the sophomoric \"satire\" that seems for some unfathomable reason to have impressed far too many people, ROBOCOP is just a big, dumb, overblown action flick. This would have been a perfect vehicle for Steven Seagal (who pretty much acts like a robot anyway) if it had been made a year or two later. On the other hand, my taste and that of the American public do not exactly run parallel, thank God. Statistically speaking, given that everyone else seems to absolutely *love* this piece of garbage, you probably will too. So watch it, if you're impressed by red-colored Karo syrup and exploding stuff. But if you happen to notice that it's continually insulting your intelligence: remember, I'm the one who warned you." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "I saw \"Robocop\" on TV for the first time in 1990,and I actually enjoyed it even tho I was just a teenager.I liked the action and the violence,and Robocop himself looked cooler than everything...so what's not to like about this sci-fi action?First of all,the Verhoeven touch:the Dutch director loves the extreme violence and Robocop doesn't make exception..I actually have no problem with violence in movies,it could be funny as hell and also a sign of style.John Woo in his best Chinese days directed some of the best action movies I've ever seen,and they all had oceans of blood in em.But Verhoeven is different,his representation of violence is pure splatter and gratuitous.You can almost see the smile of his face when he represents the ultra-violent Murphy's execution by Clarence and his men.And then we see brains splattered,eyes ripped off,a guy obliterated by a malfunctioning prototype and so on.So this is the first problem,the over the top,gratuitous violence. The second problem is the crappy stop motion.I don't know why they used a horribly animated ED-209 instead of a real-size thing,but the scenes in which we see it,it looks hilarious. Third thing:not so much and not so good action.Don't get me wrong,Verhoeven is capable of filming some good action-Total Recall over all-,but this movie needed more and better scenes because it has such a cool character. Peter Weller does a good job although we mostly see him with his iron mask on,but it must have been a pain to wear that suit.Good supporting characters and a always great Kurtwood Smith who portrays the ruthless crime lord Clarence Butticker-so brave that he thinks he could go hand to hand with Robocop,and obviously fails with one eye less.The soundtrack is great,nothing to say about it. Last word:Robocop is a good movie,it has a good screenplay and it's entertaining,but leaves a lot to be desired.Cut off the flick all the things I mentioned above and you will have a great action sci-fi drama.If only they gave it to a different director....." "OK, I'm not a fan. But undoubtedly this movie had startling success; which led to a second part, a third part, and a fourth TV one, not to mention a TV series and another TV series but animated! So, why is that ? RoboCop (1987) is original when it comes to accumulate that load of drastic and loud live cartoon action, and in a big production too. Its title character was one of the first icy rigid heroes (as a machine, not like Arnie from the same era) who you love to combine with; to immerse in his violence, live the solidity, and forget all the feelings which make you too weak, fall in love, and have that human yet cruel wounds. It's a perfect way to enjoy the illusion of owning a super distractive ability, blowing up your annoying foes, and serving the society in the same time. So RoboCop, as a movie or a character, managed in the late 1980s to get a special place in the pop-culture and be a noticeable indicator in terms of the direct connection between the violence of reality and the violence of art, whereas the first comes always first, and art is naturally the mirror. Now let me elaborate on why this successful hero and movie aren't successful for me. First off, that literally metallic hero. They gave us a Ropo-Dirty Harry or his inbred development in the sci-fi genre after 15 years of its first appearance. Nevertheless, Inspector Harry is more human and less ridiculous (and you can say that again if replaced Dirty Harry with Darth Vader !). In short, with the way he speaks and moves, Robocop is too silly he's laughable ! As for the movie, I believe that its success had a lot to do with its violence, and the exaggerated representation of it on screen; by the camera's angles, the rough editing, the crack-brained special effects and the very profuse explosions ! This movie loyally imitated the foolish violence of the video games, with doubling it many times. To some extent, RoboCop (1987) did for the action movies what Madonna did for the pop singing; since both of them crowded the materialistically attractive elements; the harsh violence in the action blockbusters, and the sexiness in the modern singing and dancing; to shake up the pop culture, and  yes  win more money, rephrasing the rule from \"Sex Sells\" to \"Abundant Violence and Sex Abundantly Sell\" ! While it pretends to be satirical, the movie is so flat and hollow. Don't wait for a respectful satire about violent toys, inane media, or rotten authority; whether governments or companies. Because any social or political commentary, rather any serious concept; was exterminated by the heavy violence. In fact, the sole substance this movie has is seducing the audience and seizing their money by hectic and bloody fights ! Let alone, how this so-called satire was presented through comic touches; as TV news or commercials (about cheap violent toys !), with repeating them, in rhythmical manner, till the end of the movie.. the very movie which confirmed all the time that it's a real cheap violent toy in itself, having no difference except for its too much violence, extravagance and pretension ! Over and above, that insufferably disturbing spirit all the time. And it doesn't come from the cold mechanical cadence of the title's character only, but from the character of the director as well. He confessed, in a documentary about this movie, that in 1987 he didn't know any English; therefore he handled the work, so everybody, with great nervousness and unbroken outburst, and it's obvious how this infected the crew and the movie. Hence, it's easy to understand the secret of all the hysterical atmosphere and the burning pace.. It's Mr. Paul Verhoeven ladies and gentlemen ! Objectively speaking, RopoCop is some icon in the history of the American culture, which tells you a lot about the Americans themselves in one era. Plus it did leave an effect on the next era (Judge Dredd for little instance). Though, subjectively speaking, RopoCop is one heck of a stupid odious hero, all of what he does is goofy and ludicrous, this movie is sickening delirious nightmare, and whenever I hear its last line \"Call Me Murphy\" I instantly replay \"Sorry, I Call You Jerk\" !" "Boy is this film rubbish. If you want a robots film you will not find one that is worse.It's just a piece of rubbish on the ground. The story is so dumb and it goes on forever before it ends. It's a story about a cop who is shot all over the place but still doesn't die, and then he's turned into a robot. See what I mean? This is such a rubbish story. He goes after the man who killed him and tries to kill him back. This will make you feel so miserable, like coming home to find your house burgled. All the actors look weird and they are too old. The cops in the movie look more like salesmen. The special effects are rubbish which means that when they happen in the movie it makes you point and laugh at how rubbish they are. If they had made more effort to make them look better the film would have been better." "this is what i call unrealistic film. and i hate unrealistic films. behavior of people is unrealistic. it's not bad because of the story, which i like, and i think is possible. if you're kid then this film is probably good because you dont notice lack of realism yet. filmmakers think because science fiction is not real, then they can make also all other stuff in film non-realistic. this is problem with bad science fiction films. good science fiction films are realistic, like Alien and James Cameron films. realism in Alien is for example this: when man with beard goes with flame gun to chase alien. then when he is there he says: \"I don't think this is good idea. I want to get out of here.\" This is really how human psychology works. you can't know how you will feel in certain situation until you are there. 1/10" "Add another review" "Find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your Watchlist and rate your favorite movies and TV shows on your phone or tablet!")("Movies, TV & Showtimes" "Celebs, Events & Photos" "News & Community" "Watchlist" "" "Find industry contacts & talent representation" "Manage your photos, credits, & more" "Showcase yourself on IMDb & Amazon" "Sign in with Facebook Other Sign in options" "Own the rights?" "It's a shame that this movie is usually snubbed by shoving it into the \"action\" category. Sure, there are lot of legendary action sequences to be found, but RoboCop is a LOT more than that. Next time when you watch it, try to shift your focus from the cyborgs, explosions and gore towards the writing. From the main theme of criticizing the modern money driven society (a topic still relevant today, and will most likely be so in the future as well) all the way to the smallest bits of dialogue, the writing is nothing short of outstanding. RoboCop is simply the most intelligent \"action\" film to come out of Hollywood, ever. Unfortunately, the cleverness is hidden \"between the lines\" of comic book action. No wonder so many people fail to see this film for what it really is. Amazing cinematography, solid performances (especially from Kurtwood Smith and Miguel Ferrer), memorable musical score.. The list is endless. Granted, the stop motion effects of ED-209 look quite old today, but you have to remember we're talking about a movie made in 1987. RoboCop has its faults, like the rather embarrassing toxic waste scene, but they are easily forgiven compared to all the good things. You must be thinking \"What is this guy on? It's just a dumb little action flick about a cyborg!\" .. Relax, take a deep breath and watch it again. I like obscure art films as much as the next guy, but I'm not going to dismiss such greatness just because it comes wrapped in cartoon violence. I'm not saying RoboCop is art, the best movie ever made or the most important film of the year/decade/millennium. But it definitely deserves to be regarded higher. My only question is: How could Verhoeven succeed so well with this movie, and fail miserably in ALL other Hollywood titles he has worked on?" "Robocop is an unbelieveable experience. I haven't watched the film since 1988 and the other day I recieved it on DVD. So I eagerly popped it in the player and BOOM!!! The only way I can describe Robocop is ultraviolence. The film is so over the top and out of control. The film speaks of a future where big companies will run the governmental defense. Those times are upon us more and more everyday. Paul Verhoeven has made one of the most important science fiction films ever made and it's a brillant piece of cinema." "Paul Verhoeven's career in recent years has been wildly uneven, but back in the 1980s he rocked! His movies 'Spetters', 'The Fourth Man' and 'Flesh & Blood' are all brilliant and worth tracking down. His next movie, his first Hollywood one, could have been a complete disaster. Verhoeven initially passed on it without reading the script and wasn't experienced in working with special effects or a fan of science fiction. Thankfully his wife insisted he make the picture and the end result was a triumph. Apparently this was a very tough shoot for all concerned but the bottom line is what is on screen, and it really works. Few movies if any have managed to juggle SF, action and grim satire in such an entertaining and original fashion. Verhoeven was blessed with an excellent script, a well chosen bunch of actors, and a great behind the scenes team, and added to his own vision 'RoboCop' turned out to be one of the best movies of the 1980s, whatever the genre. Peter Weller ('Buckaroo Banzai') pulls off a difficult job - making the audience care about a guy in a monster suit. Probably the best performance of its kind since Boris Karloff in James Whale's 'Frankenstein' back in the 1930s. Nancy Allen ('Dressed To Kill'), Kurtwood Smith ('12.01 PM'), Ronny Cox ('Deliverance'), Miguel Ferrer ('Twin Peaks'), and the rest of the supporting cast are all first rate, and everything about this movie is perfect. Verhoeven stumbled with his next movie 'Total Recall', and apart from 'Starship Troopers' has pretty much failed to fulfill his potential, but 'RoboCop' remains a classic SF/action movie and a fantastic way to end a great decade of work." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "The success of this movie can be credited to one man; Paul Verhoeven. His special touch of violence, gore and social satire make the movie more than just your average B-movie, with a lame title and simple story and characters. Yes, without Verhoeven this movie seriously would had been nothing more like another B-movie on par with science-fiction/action movies like \"Timecop\" and Albert Pyun movies. The main story of \"RoboCop\" itself is simply and not that complex, however Verhoeven manages to put many different layers for the story as well as the characters in the movie. The social satire in the movie works out brilliantly and is what makes the movie perhaps more entertaining than thrilling or tense. Especially those typical Verhoeven news sketches are brilliant! But also those who will not be able to understand or fully appreciate the social satire elements in the movie, will have plenty to enjoy while watching this. The action itself is top-class and the characters are fun as well as cool. RoboCop himself looks awesome, both in his movements and the way his costume looks. Oh and of course I may not forget his awesome gun! The movie is not only filled with some typical Verhoeven social satire elements but also with some trademark Verhoeven gore and violence. The way Murphy gets killed is very graphic and disturbing. But as always in most Verhoeven movies is the case, the violence is so over-the-top that it's not really shocking to look at but almost more comical like because it's just so over-the-top. Especially what happens to Emil at the end, the gore is way over-the-top there and I absolutely love it! In a movie like this the characters are also always important. Especially the villains and yes, \"RoboCop\" has some highly entertaining and good villains. The group of Clarence, Leon, Joe and Steve are a bunch of entertaining, charismatic stereotypical villains. But also the more educated villains like Dick Jones (Ronny Cox) and Bob Morton (a very young Miguel Ferrer) who also isn't a very nice person. But also the mechanical villain ED-209 is extremely cool and dangerous looking. The stop-motion effects for him are of course heavily outdated this days but it takes away nothing of his threatening appearance. All of the character are entertaining and well developed. Characters also worth mentioning are The Old Man (Dan O'Herlihy) who plays the president of OCP and you can tell by his face gestures that he's not very pleased with the direction Dick Jones is heading towards with the company and Johnson who is always smiling. And of course let's not forget Bixby \"I'd buy that for a dollar!\" Snyder, he's a real classic! They should given that guy a real show on TV. Also the musical score by Basil Poledouris is what helps to make this movie a very memorable one. Poledouris delivers one of his best works. When will he finally get some more attention from the big awards? He has made some great stuff but he rarely has won anything of importance with it. A bit of a disgrace for such a wonderful composer. All in all this is a brilliantly entertaining science-fiction/action movie that simply is perfect in every way, mainly thanks to Verhoeven his input. 10/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "When I first saw \"Robocop\" on Showtime back in 1989, I was about 8 years old. It was definitely the most violent, and one of the most sophisticated films I'd ever seen (at that time...being 8, my dad had issues with showing me \"Blade Runner\" though he seriously wanted me to since it was first released). Everything about the film grabbed me on some level. A lot of people seem to really like this film, though I've heard a share of people and critics say that it's a second-rate film due to the extensive violence and sappy dialogue, calling it cartoon-ish. Well, I have to say that the cartoon-ish quality to the film is part of its allure. It's not only a humorous device for the sake of entertainment, but its significance to the story is great. This is a dystopian future where big companies control almost every part of our existence, from the government to the police to our domestic lives. It's almost Orwell-ian (anybody notice how the OCP building is the tallest in the city?). It's a future where criminals run rampant in every form, from street thugs to business execs. Seriously, the head villain is a greedy business suit who uses a street gang to create trouble so he can provide a solution in the form of a droid with enough firepower to put up a fight with a tank...only to have that blow up in his face and mutilate a fellow exec at its unveiling. Bill Gates never had a bad day like this. Or how about when the gang blows Murphy into a million pieces with enough shotgun ammo to make even the NRA cringe, totally destroying any remnants of his right arm. It's cartoon-ish because it's a comentary on the direction the world could conceivably take, while at the same time being a source of entertainment. Whether the entertainment value was intended for people who love to see guns blazing or for people who like to see horrifying sights (Murphy's execution, for as long as it was and as bloody as it was, HAD to demand a lot of sympathy from people...if it didn't, there's something wrong with you, and let's not forget when Robocop was getting shot up by the swat team). This film has everything going for it. A plot that exists on more levels than its B-movie surface. It's a social commentary, a satire, an action film, a sci-fi film, and at times even a comedy (when Robocop dragged the guy away by his hair, I laughed like mad). The acting is great, the effects are great (not perfect, but that adds to the visual appeal because it's as gritty as the story), the music is great (kudos to Basil Poledouris on an amazing score), and overall...this film is one of the greatest films of its genre. I wouldn't call it \"THE\" greatest, but it's very high up there. I still have yet to see the uncut Director's version, but knowing Paul Verhoeven's work as I do, I know it must be far more brutal than the domestic version (hard to grasp with how far this film goes, but...it evidently went further, showing just how cartoon-ish things can get I suppose). I give it a definite 10/10!!!" "\"RoboCop\" is a surprisingly impressive action film about a young cop (Peter Weller) who is killed by a gang of cruel criminals and is brought back to life with both human and robotic characteristics. Now he is cleaning up the city of Detroit and going after those who brutally murdered him when he was 100% human. This film is ultra-violent in every sense of the word. Anyone under the age of 17 should be strongly cautioned before seeing this film. However, the violence makes the film realistic and more exciting. Paul Verhoeven does some of his best work as a director. The screenplay is very smart for an action film and all the actors give bravura performances. Peter Weller will always be remembered as the original \"RoboCop\". Ronny Cox, Nancy Allen, Miguel Ferrer, and an incredibly evil Kurtwood Smith all do the best work of their careers. An impressive film from the action genre. 4 stars out of 5." "The thing people are starting to realize about Paul Verhoeven is that most of his films are ultimately high concept satires. Both \"Showgirls\" and \"Starship Troopers\" have been recently undergoing reevaluation and getting the critical praise that was completely absent when originally released. \"Robocop\" was Verhoeven's first American success, and while it was never damned in the way his later projects were, many viewers are just starting to pick up on the abundance of satire the material contains, even past the television parodies. The main jab is that Robocop is ostensibly the hero, but his tactics against criminals are often more brutal than the initial crimes themselves. Fortunately, audiences don't need to pay attention to the subtext to enjoy the film. In addition to being an extremely low key comedy, the film also works as an action picture. The action sequences are very well handled by Verhoeven, full of excitement and violence. Its easy to see why this was a huge box office hit when originally released. The pace never once slows down. Another memorable aspect of the picture, even more so than Robocop possibly, are the colorful villains. Ronny Cox is an underrated actor and excels here as the big business villain. Even more astonishing is Kurtwood Smith, an actor best known to my generation for playing Red on \"That 70s Show\", as one of the most hiss-worthy and flat-out sadistic bad guys ever in a film. The rest of the cast is good, but its the villains that steal the show. Overall, \"Robocop\" remains incredibly enjoyable to watch over twenty years later. (8/10)" "Robocop, born of technology is a cyborg, half man/half machine. The future of Law enforcement is here, and he's kicking ass. Alex Murphy was the unfortunate candidate chosen to be robocop after he was brutally massacred by a gang of scumbag criminals. And the robocop program was brought in, after the E.D. 209 (An all robot killing machine) proto-type failed so disastrously. Alex Murphy, now Robocop is effectively dead, but he still has a memory, and sets out on a quest to avenge his own Death, by finding the scumbags responsible. With some quite horrific violence (E.D. 209 and Murphy scenes mainly) and some brilliant action, Robocop is character that you will warm to, as he fights crime on a personal level. Solid entertainment 8/10" "In a futurist Detroit, crime is high and the police are run by a massive private company, keener to reduce running costs than reduce crime. When their new police robot ED209 develops a glitch, they turn to a prototype that blends human tissue with high-tech circuitry. Meanwhile Police officer Murphy and his partner Lewis are out gunned by criminals leaving Murphy mortally wounded. OCP take Murphy's body and use it to make Robocop. However Robocop is so successful that he is targeted by criminal Boddicker. Boddicker turns to his shadowy partners in crime, while Robocop struggles to deal with human memories and a programming system that seems designed to control him and keep him in the dark. Verhoeven's first US film was to set the mould for how the rest of his career would pan out - extreme violence and very little idea of restraint. However this is one of his best films and has much in common with one of his other best (Starship Troopers) - ultra-violence, funny black humour, great action and tonnes of satirical digs at modern life. Here the plot revolves around the creation of Robocop and his fight against crime that goes right to the top. This is complimented by the sub-plot of him trying to rediscover his human side. This is full of great action scenes and eccentric villains. The black comedy is funny, although sometimes you feel bad laughing at so much violence, but the sideswipes are the best. Verhoeven takes digs at TV with his advert filled news broadcasts, at privatisation by showing the crumbling police stations and the huge corporate towers and at heroism by showing Robocop creating just as much mayhem and destruction as the criminals he pursues. His strength however is the action scenes and the sense of tension he creates - I'll don't think anyone can forget the sheer terror of ED209's `glitch'. Weller is good - cast because of his strong jaw and ability to project emotion through a suit of armour - and he does manage to bring out the human side. Allen is good but a but dry. The real support comes from the eccentric, and well known villains and corporate bosses. Ronny Cox, Smith, Ray Wise, Perry, O'Herlihy and Miguel Ferrer are all great in various capacities. Criminal or greedy corporate leader - it's hard to tell which is which at times. A classic bit of sci-fi. Verhoeven has sadly not had a moment as fine as this since and has recently had problems being excessive in Hollywood - the land of excess! This is a landmark film that may not be to everyone's taste." "I've got the music for this movie humming in my head as I type the review. Maybe it's the effect of the movie, or the computer-game based on the movie, I'm not quite sure. Either way it's put me in a more agreeable mood towards this picture. In the future-world of `Robocop', crime is running wild. The OCP, the police of Detroit, try desperately to fight against it but it's a losing battle. When Officer Murphy is brutally gunned down by a bunch of thugs they see an opportunity to test a new technology. Infusing the body with cyber-technology they create the ultimate crime-fighting machine - the synthetic Robocop. Robocop is out to fight crime. but finds that the fight may take him places he never thought of, including inside his past that he thought erased. Acting? It's actually above average for a sci-fi flick. Peter Weller is mostly stoic and chisel-jawed here, as he should be seeing as how he's a robot. However the emotion underneath is shown in the glimpse of the eyes, the almost too-determined posture. It's subtle but it works. Those playing the villains have the real fun. They seem to have delight in playing utter pieces of scum, camping it up in a delightfully menacing fashion that's a joy to see. Speaking of camp. this movie has a great comic-book feel to it. Paul Verhoeven, and the script, have their tongue lodged firmly in their cheek as they make this movie into a satire about the way our vales are changing. The over-the-top violence of the future is reflected in a blackly humorous style by contrasting it against fake-news and ad-snippets. The sheer amount of bullets flying is too much to take in and so you are reduced to incredulity and smiles rather than horror. This is intentional, a saturation of the sensibilities. Without it the movie could feel very bleak. With it there's the feeling of adventure, and an ironic acknowledgement of our own blood-lust in movies. The tone melds with the viewer very well and makes the movie appear more intelligent than it actually probably is, which is something to be said in the IQ of 0 sci-fi culture we're often in. There's enough action throughout this movie that you're never left bored. The villains have about as much dimension as a dot, but Robocop himself has enough character to have merited the concept of a franchise (even if the follow-ups failed to live up the series' potential). It's a very entertaining piece which is told in a manner that's quite amusing. Worthy of a watch, just don't accept to be blown away. 7/10."

"In a crime ridden Detroit of the near future a corporate company OCP has the answer to fighting crime - invent a new type of policeman who won't go on strike . After the death of a policeman called Murphy they stick his body in to a metal shell . Murphy however can still remember a time when he was human I once did an evening film course called Talking Pictures which would involve watching a film then having a two hour group discussion on the film . I saw the filmography before the class started and the vast majority would be art house foreign cinema . The one exception was ROBOCOP and I knew instantly this was the one that was going to split the group right down the middle in to love it or hate it with no in between . True to form this how things worked out . Most the class despised it wondering why the class had to watch such a cartoonish commercial film . I however did state I loved it and considered it to be the third best SF movie of the 1980s behind THE TERMINATOR and ALIENS What makes ROBOCOP such a cerebral enjoyable film is the uncommon mix of social satire and no holds barred Verhoeven excess . While \" greed is good \" to a certain extent the idea of corporate capitalism is something to be rejected . A small self elected clique ruling over the Universe in order to maximise profits is a bad mix of capitalism meets self serving communism . Not so much a mixed economic system but more a combination of greedy speculators from one system being merged with the unthinking party loyalty of the other system . It's greed for money plus greed for power which is a marriage made in hell and being dead isn't enough to make you escape the clutches of OCP and the film revolves around the human element of Murphy remembering who he once was and it's this that is at the core of the movie Of course Verhoeven isn't a director who does sentimental mawkish stuff and I doubt if the audience was wanting to see a Walt Disney film . What they were wanting to see was bad things happen to very bad people and you can't help cheering as criminals get killed , maimed , mutilated and in one case melted . It's a violent film but one that is so cartoonish that the violence is not to be taken seriously , a fact reflected in the loud slightly unrealistic acting style . This attitude wasn't enough to stop its British network premiere on ITV becoming farcical with a TV version being broadcast with notorious lines like \" you gonna be a bad mother crusher \" along with key scenes like the ones with mister melty conspicuous by their absence There is of course a new version of ROBOCOP hitting the cinema this week but is a film I have no interest in watching judging by the clips I've seen of it . It's strange to think that another Verhoeven classic TOTAL RECALL was also recently remade . As it stands the original ROBOCOP remains one of the greatest genre films from the 1980s containing wit , satire and enjoyably mean carnage" "Detroit is under siege by a corrupt CEO in the police department...also by rapists, robbers, and the group of thugs who murdered Officer Murphy. Murphy (flawlessly played by Peter Weller) was a family man with a big heart whose body is eventually 'saved' by tech-geniuses, transforming him into a robot-cop (with a big heart, natch). The violence in the film is incredibly brutal in the manner of \"Death Wish\", yet it can almost be overlooked--even deemed necessary--in the context of the plot. Weller exudes sensitivity (not easy to do under that coat of armor), and he's matched very well by Ronny Cox (delightfully sinister and sniveling) and spunky Nancy Allen (in her best performance). A bleak vision of the future, though one which offers hope underneath its chestplate of destruction. Followed by \"RoboCop 2\" in 1990, \"RoboCop 3\" in 1993, and a television series in 1994. ***1/2 from ****" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This was a film that I enjoyed watching when I was a kid and it was my favorite film. Now, years later I just watched it and I was hesitant because I thought it would be cheesy, but it was amazing. It is ultra violent even by today's standards. It is a great mix of action and sci-fi and it has a message. You would not have to look hard into this film to see some deeper meaning in it, though it appears to just be a action film it is also a testament to human life. One of the most prominent messages in this film is that you can put a human in a robotic shell but he is still a human. It also has messages about corporations running our lives. There is a scene where the main character has been killed and the company that owns the police is about to turn him into Robocop and someone says is this OK and the corporate rep says \"we own him, we can do whatever we like with him.\" It is a classic film and one that has to be watched by everybody. It disappoints me that in every top 100 movies list or somethings like that you will never see this film, I think it is a classic and is one of the most underrated films of all time." "Back when I was the proud owner of a top of the range ZX Spectrum +2a, Robocop was probably the best platform game that I ever played. It had every thing you could want from a game: A good plot, great graphics and really cool guns! I hadn't seen the film at this point, I'm not sure why, I was way too young, yes, but that has never stopped anyone, least of all me. When I did get around to seeing the film (I still would have been underage) I loved it! It had everything: A good plot, good effects and it had really cool guns!! A few years ago, given a gentle prod by an interview with the director, I sat down and watched Robocop from a different standpoint and bugger me it was even better, it had everything: Social comment, religious overtones, biting satire and really cool guns! When Murphy is killed at the beginning of the film it's because he's a policeman, a man who gives his life to help others, a man who has no crimes and no sins. He has a wife and child and lives an idyllic life despite working to help the beaten and bedraggled, the down trodden and helpless. He's persecuted, crucified and when the scientists get hold of him they seal him in a metal tomb from which they believe he can never escape. I'm being unsubtle here but there really is no need to beat around the bush with these things. Murphy is being depicted as a Messiah for 21st Century America, a messiah as the America dictates, a messiah, that is, with really cool guns! Robocop is, despite this, a VERY funny film. But is it a piece of Hollywood trash masquerading as intelligent cinema? Or is a clever comment on America masquerading as trash? Well, let's face it, it's both! The social commentary on how big business is big crime and money is the route of all evil is as clumsy as it is obvious. However, the accusatory tone it adopts when dealing with its hero is superbly realised and works brilliantly because of it. Robocop is a character ripped from a 50's comic strip; he is violent but just, mechanical but warm and yet still, somehow, attractive to women. The director pokes fun at the ease with which he attracts the audience to his central character and develops the messiah characteristics almost as a joke on his own creation. He knows Robocop is too good to be true and has fun raising his status to king of men, even having him walk on water as he extracts his revenge on the men who 'killed' him. The real twist for me is that in order to dispense with the man who masterminded the criminal activities he has been investigating, Robocop has to break the rules. Having already begun to regain his memories and escape his tomb he proceeds to OCP to meet his Nemesis. Robocop wants to kill him, he needs to kill him, and the only way he can escape his tomb is to destroy the man who put him in it. Yet his directives, his internal rules-set down by someone else- that guide his life forbid him to do it! Thall Shalt Not Kill. You've all seen the film, you all know what happens. So what is Verhoevan saying about his messiah for the 21st century?" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "\"Robocop\" was what gave the world the robotic police officer that would rival the Terminator as the greatest cyborg film character of all time. Although, I'm not gonna take a side in that debate, but I am gonna give Robocop the recognition it deserves. He was something that was totally new at the time (1987), and since then the movie got 2 (crappy) sequels, a comic book and a mini-series. Robocop is set in the future and portrays a very dark version of Detroit, and its crime level has gone up considerably. In it, a cop named Alex Murphy gets literally blown away by a gang of nasty criminals on his first day on the job. But later a company (OCP) uses his remains to build a mechanical cop in order to cut down on the crime in order to build \"Delta City\" to replace the corrupted dystopia that was once Detroit. Later on, Robocop makes a name for himself around the city, but unexpectedly he starts remembering what he was before his death, and through this we start to learn more about Murphy since we didn't zilch about him before he died. And this is how he starts to regain his lost humanity. And the first rule about making a movie with a robot for a character is that you MUST make it human in some way, that's the reason why Robocop worked so well and why \"Terminator 2\" worked so well. Towards the ending, after he takes off his helmet for the final battle, reveals his face. And a little later, after the Old Man asks him for his name, he replies \"Murphy\", this is one of the most heart-touching moments in science fiction which generally don't have moments like those. The symbolism in here is perfect. Another thing that really got me were the bad guys. And the best of the gang is without a doubt, Kurtwood Smith as Clarence Boddicker. Honestly, I have never seen a guy who looks like a 50 year old pencil pusher to be so threatening. He delivers his lines with such ferocity and perfection that he becomes perhaps one of the greatest villains in the history of cinema. And his classic lines, \"Can you fly, Bobby?\" and \"B*****s, leave!\" will never be forgotten. Also, his crew is worth noting, Emil will be known for the gas station scene (probably the best part of the movie), Joe will be remembered for his laugh and his \"Does it hurt? Does it hurt?\" line. And Leon will be recognized for his hilarious expression he makes when the disfigured Emil confronts him and when Robocop pulls his hair in the dance club. And lastly Clarence will be known for pretty much everything he does and says in here. And all these guys are MEAN, plain and simple. They basically kill and hurt others for their own amusement and express no pity or remorse at all. These guys are as real as movie villains could possibly get. The action is excellent, the gas station scene was bad@$$, the drug factory shootout was fantastic and the ending when Robocop takes out all the bad guys in the same place where they killed him at the steel mill is unforgettable, thanks to the Cobra Assault Cannons (forgot what they're called), but it's one of the sweetest weapons ever made up in a film. The one liners couldn't have been better. \"Dead or alive, you're coming with me\" is a quote that should've been on the Top 100, but for some reason, it's not. \"Your move, creep\" is another worth mentioning. And the before mentioned stuff that the bad guys say are pretty cool to say in real life situations as well. Robocop is a classic in the golden age of science fiction when we didn't have too many of that over-the-top, unoriginal crap that we're getting now. I'm gonna cherish this movie forever, and I hope you will too." "\"RoboCop\" is the sort of movie that seems like it would be more than idiotic if you only hear about it once. But it turns out to actually be quite good. Less of an action movie than a look at urban decay, the movie makes the most of its potential at every turn. Officers Alex J. Murphy (Peter Weller) and Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen) patrol the streets of crime-ridden Detroit. One day, while tracking down a gang, Murphy gets cornered and shot to death. But that's not the end of him; a group of scientists turns him into the steel-clad title character. Before too long, RoboCop is out fighting crime like never before. In the process, he not only decides to find the gang that killed him, but also investigates a conspiracy going to the city's highest levels of government. Watching the movie, you get the feeling that everyone must have had a lot of fun making it. It's really neat now that I know that Kurtwood Smith - aka Red Foreman on \"That '70s Show\" - played one of the gang members. Paul Verhoeven, who turned out the masterpiece \"Soldier of Orange\" in his native Netherlands, created something more than cool here. You'll love it." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "\"Robocop\" is one of those movies that inspires debate, as well it should. The director, Paul Verhoeven (who later became an even bigger player with films like \"Total Recall\" and \"Basic Instinct\") has definitely indulged in extreme violence and has no qualms about presenting violence as an object of fun. But I would defend it even if its only virtue was its action sequences because those elements are handled so well. There's a number of imaginatively staged action scenes, and it never devolves into an arcade-style shooting gallery like so many 80s actions films do. The action is compelling because of Verhoeven's style and because he's given the characters enough substance that we care about what happens to them, including at least a half dozen interesting villains. A lot of discussion has revolved around whether or not this film deserves to be called satire. Those looking for Moliere-like pearls in Verhoeven's modestly amusing commercial interruptions are understandably disappointed. This isn't the kind of movie that you can look at or objectify in order to access its ideas on an intellectual level. It's a different kind of beast: it must be entered into, it must fulfill its function as an action narrative first and foremost and it carries its ideas like a wedding train dragged by a semi-truck a prominent after-thought. At any rate I feel it's closer to camp than satire, one of the first camp action films of the 80s style I would argue (\"Remo Williams\" being another, now largely forgotten). It's a good drinking movie, and this most recent time when I watched it my friend and I were laughing and yelling so much that we probably missed half the dialog. But I don't think we missed much of the point. If it was a satire, Robocop wouldn't emerge as such a serious figure invested with pathos and personality. The movie itself is best enjoyed in my opinion as a joyride with some interesting commentary about America's relationship to violence thrown in by way of farce; you wait for each villain to meet his fitting end and watch the carnage pile up. The villains are all so easy to hate, and all the actors playing them are having a lot of fun. Ronny Cox is fantastic as the corporate heel, but I've always enjoyed Kurtwood Smith the most. Really this is a very well-cast movie all around. I love the scene where Miguel Ferrer has his coke party interrupted by Smith with his bomb and his video. It's easy to underestimate the kind of skill Smith shows when he's so funny and obviously has his tongue in cheek but still manages to be convincingly sadistic and evil. Honestly, a comparison to Vincent Price in his heyday is not unwarranted. Weller for his part is adequate and it's a difficult role so that's no insult. I didn't care for Nancy Allen in the movie but I can't really put my finger on the reasons. I guess she just came across as very tentative. I think it was a small mistake for Verhoeven to have her play it in a more grounded mode; his butt-kicking females are more fascinating but he does always have problems directing female heroes (see \"Showgirls\" and \"Total Recall\" for example). I think this is a pretty intelligent movie with some layers to it. It's better as science fiction than you would at first suspect, mining Frankenstein territory in a number of scenes  particularly where the callous nature of the creator is shown (\"lose the arm\") and when the police force turns on Robocop like the mob of angry villagers in Whale's film version. In Shelley's time perhaps a single scientist was a suitable object of terror, but by choosing corporate monster-makers the writers of this film gave the story a far more prescient object for paranoia. Indeed, even since I last saw the film in the late 90s, the film's central premise has become even more relevant due to America's misadventures with corporate security forces in Iraq. This time around I noticed all the elements of Western parody in the film. Not just the twirling pistol (which also, interestingly, performs a plot function by identifying Robocop as Murphy) but also in various other scenes. For example one poster here complained about the \"generic\" or obligatory nature of the convenience store scene and the rape scene where Robocop is introduced as a hero. I couldn't disagree more. They parallel the arrival of the hero in a traditional Western; the convenience store works for the trading post in \"Shane\", the nightclub scene doubles for a tavern brawl (i.e. the beginning of \"Rio Bravo\") and the attempted rape parallels any number of damsel in distress scenarios. That's a very funny scene for me because of the way the girl goes up to Robocop after he rescues her and kind of drapes herself over him (\"My hero!\"), a very prototypical American bit that you'd see in a Randolph Scott Western from the 40s. Robocop's sterile reaction is perfect, again a parody of the emotionless law enforcing gunfighter of the Old West of American mythology. I expect to find more and more interesting elements the more I watch the film over the years. I think recently its reputation has taken a slight hit  look at the interesting life this film has had. Originally it was a big hit both in theaters and on video. Over the years it was not forgotten because action movie fans would return to it and be surprised at how well it holds up and how many ideas are floating about beneath the surface. Then based on their recommendations movie-goers of a more intellectual bent gave the movie a chance and were disappointed. It's time for the pendulum to swing back and for the movie to be reclaimed as what it is  an intelligent violent film." "RoboCop is a very good but violent film that in My opinion is not for kids. I say not for kids because unlike most films the violence it shows is very graphic. Though the film is somewhat sad but the film is never boring and has good acting. Peter Weller did an outstanding job being RoboCop! Ronny Cox puts on a great performance but to me his role is similar to his role in Total Recall and Kurtwood Smith was good aswell. Miguel Ferrer was good and Nancy Allen looked good. Great music by Basil Poledouris and good direction by veteran director Paul Verhoeven. This is the first of a three film series. This is a great film for action and sci-fi fans alike!" "Robocop is Truly a great violent movie. Packed with plenty of blood and Violence, this is one entertaining movie. Set in Detroit, one of the most violent city's, Robocop is the story of a police killed by a ruthless gang. He is later used in a experiment, and becomes the half man half machine, Robocop. Peter Sellers gives us the best movie of his entire career. Paul Verhoevan has made some great film like Basic Instict, Hollow Man, Starship troopers and Total Recall. I think Robocop, is still is best work out of the lot. It is the best out of the Robocop trilogy by a margin. The Second part was entertaining in some scenes and is worth watching. The third was a absolute disaster, with nothing great about it, apart from robot Ninjas. Watch Robocop 1, it is a fabulous movie." "Director Paul Verhoven, the director of TOTAL RECALL unleashes a very original film, that despite what my first thought upon seeing commercials was, is not a copy off of the Terminator. The actors are not very famous, but sometimes the best films have no name actors-and sometimes you get the best performances out of them because they're not full of themselves. The blend of sci-fi, action, and thriller was very good, and the stunts and action scenes themselves were memorable. Overall ROBOCOP is a very under-rated film (in the way of critics and popularity) but for anyone who's seen it, they know when it's over that THEY have found an entertaining blockbuster. That's how films like 'Speed' and such were accepted so well. Audiences not only can recognize with the characters symbolically, but they can also sit on the edge of their seats. Such a film is Robocop. A very entertaining at the most, well done film. I give it a good rating-it's just pure entertainment! 3.5/5 STARS--" "Add another review" "Find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your Watchlist and rate your favorite movies and TV shows on your phone or tablet!")("Movies, TV & Showtimes" "Celebs, Events & Photos" "News & Community" "Watchlist" "" "Find industry contacts & talent representation" "Manage your photos, credits, & more" "Showcase yourself on IMDb & Amazon" "Sign in with Facebook Other Sign in options" "Own the rights?" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "SOME SPOILERS \"You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.\" - The Miranda Warning For me, one of the best parts of \"RoboCop\" comes at the very end. An old man asks the robot, \"What's your name, son?\" The robot cop turns his head, sports a wan smile, and says, \"Murphy.\" Then as he turns to start to walk away the camera cuts to black and the theme song roars in as we read the bold print on-screen that says, \"ROBOCOP.\" \"RoboCop\" could be called a rip-off of \"The Terminator\" in many senses. The trailer even used the exact same theme song as that of \"Terminator.\" But \"RoboCop\" is a different story in many ways, and, in some ways, the action is even better than that in \"The Terminator\" (though I must include that the latter film is a better one overall). The film's hero, RoboCop, has a gentle affection to him absent in the evil \"Terminator,\" mainly because he is still human in some ways. It starts with a man named Murphy (Peter Wellers). Amid talks of a police strike, he and his new partner (Nancy Allen) chase down a pack of criminals to an abandoned warehouse. After being caught, graphically tortured and then shot in the head by the gang, Murphy is shipped off to a hospital whereupon he is announced dead on arrival. However, Murphy is revived by fusing his body together with that of a machine robot named \"RoboCop,\" the \"future of law enforcement.\" RoboCop is a cop who will never hold a strike against the police force, never take a bribe, never become corrupt in any way. There is only one problem with RoboCop--he has flashbacks of his past life and family. He also remembers who killed him. And so RoboCop sets off to find his killers. \"RoboCop\" is an action man's action movie. Things blow up, people get killed, and there are some impressive stunts. But all the while the movie keeps true to its core. The simple premise behind the film is nothing more than a B-movie so typically found in the era of the eighties (a decade of some very memorable, very forgettable, and/or cheesy films). But it's nevertheless brought out of mediocrity by its lead performance from Peter Wellers, whose acting skills seemed pretty bad out of the suit rather than inside it, where he seems at home. Wellers (a.k.a. Buckaroo Bonzai) also extends a technique Arnold Schwarzenegger used in \"The Terminator.\" As a cyborg, Schwarzenegger would turn his head, then let the body follow. Wellers' character is even more rigid and robotic in movements than the T-800, and so he turns his head, for example, far to the right, and after a second his body spins on its heels and follows the head. Something like that takes a lot of concentration--just try walking around like that. Now add acting and remembering your lines. Wellers does a pretty good job. The director, Paul Verhoeven, knows how to construct a well-oiled action vehicle. He skips the bull and gets right to the harcore blood and guts stuff. But he does manage to bring a certain sense of connection with the character--and a sense of morals. Given another director, \"RoboCop\" would have been an average 80s film at best. Its plot vaguely resembles \"The Terminator,\" and the script isn't always A material. But Paul Verhoeven knows when and where to insert touching scenes (like when RoboCop goes through his old home and sees flashbacks), and he firmly grips the point of the story (messing with nature can be dangerous, not only physically but emotionally for the person you screwed around with). Another director helming a movie like this would never have thought to include such things. Unfortunately, Verhoeven does not know how to construct a film about a strip club (see \"Showgirls\"), but that's another story. \"RoboCop\" had amazing potential for sequels. Murphy's quest to find his family, to unlock his past, and to continue fighting crime are all the sort of stuff you hear about in comic books and comic book films. Unfortunately, the two sequels that followed \"RoboCop\" were major drags--the sort of films that \"RoboCop\" avoided becoming ever so carefully. Overblown, cheesy, stupid action flicks with no plot nor affection. As it stands, the third film has exactly 3.3 out of 10 stars on the IMDb, giving it a place on the Website's list of worst films of all time. I wouldn't go so far as to say the sequels were necessarily some of the worst films of all time, but after watching \"RoboCop\" you have an odd starvation to dig deeper into the film franchise and deeper into the story. The sequels kind of negate that starvation. \"RoboCop\" is a superhero movie, make no mistake about it. But it's an extraordinary one--an action film that starts and never lets up on its goals. And all the while it presents a truly lovable main character who is nothing more than a robot. In a time when every single action film out there presents us with overblown budgets, crappy acting, writing, directing, horrible buddies, and nothing but special effects we've seen mimicked since the release of \"The Matrix,\" \"RoboCop\" is a gentle reminder that, at one time, action movies were what they were--action movies--and the directors, writers and actors behind them had a wide range of talent. \"RoboCop\" is a B-movie, but movies of this B-quality are simply not made anymore. 5/5 stars. - John Ulmer" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "\"The sooner we admit our capacity for evil, the less apt we are at destroying one another.\" - Paul Verhoeven. Most of Verhoeven's films deal with different forms of fascism or excess. As a child, Verhoeven himself witnessed firsthand the brutalities of the Second World War. Indeed, the German Army occupied Verhoeven's own hometown, and quickly implemented a policy of \"enforced conformity\" (Gleichschaltung), shutting down all non Nazi organisations and forcing strict curfews and laws upon the Dutch population. Verhoeven himself was lined up against a wall and heckled by a German execution squad. They fired their rifles up into the air, and teased him for wetting his pants. It thus seems only normal that, later in his life, Verhoeven would become contemptuous of man. His films are routinely violent, bloody, and satirical, and some even broadcast disguised contempt for we the audience. Verhoeven's \"heroes\" are themselves often base, nasty creatures, whether they live in war-torn Europe or the contemporary psychedelia of Western techno-capitalism. Indeed, films like \"Robocop\", \"Total Recall\", \"Basic Instinct\", \"Starship Troopers\" and \"Showgirls\" all revel in a kind of tawdry decadence. Ugly, crass and loud, they're mock-celebrations of junk, money, lights and noise. Verhoeven seems to believe that Americans are capable of responding only to idiocy and base stimuli. Verhoeven's two science fiction films, \"Robocop\" and \"Starship Troopers\", are his most openly critical. Simultaneously pandering to and sneering at lug-heads, these films manages a strange juggling act; both consist of a number of ironic jokes aimed at sophisticated audience members, yet are also devoted to B movie gore and violence. The simple notion of \"revenge\" also drives both films, Verhoeven's audience whipped up in a frenzy of both blood lust and revenge. Perhaps what Verhoeven does best in these films is highlight how complacency and stupidity are prerequisites to different forms of control and abuse. \"Robocop\" makes this implicit with its truncated 3 minute news bulletins (for its ADD society), its consumer catchphrases, its themes of dehumanisation - through technology (robocop), capitalism (OCP) and the media (\"I'll buy that for a dollar!\") - all of which point to a world in which man is too busy bowing to biochemical impulses than look around. The film is so cynical, that it even suggests that the bad guys are funded by the same omniscient company that funds the military and police force. In this future world, capitalism has evolved to the point where it shoots itself in the foot just to sell itself band-aids. Verhoeven's other films do similar things. \"Basic Instinct\" and \"Showgirls\" are not full blown satires, but they are deliberately garish, mocking the very sex and sleaze they trade in. Verhoeven's Hollywood filmography itself seems like a calculated assault on sex (Basic Instinct, Hollowman, Showgirls), money and violence (Robocop, Starship Troopers), America's chief excesses. Significantly, Verhoeven's also had long-time plans to film a religious movie. 7.9/10  Some kind of classic." "For the sake of posterity, I must register my opinion of \"Robocop\", but there's not much to say that hasn't already been said. The film is a science fiction masterpiece, but it's not a heavy-handed one like \"2001\" or a ponderous one like \"Blade Runner\". It is packed not only with action and the most explicit of screen violence, but with incisive ideas and frightening concepts about the future, many of which have already come to pass. Director Paul Verhoeven, who has made great films like \"Turkish Delight\" \"Spetters\", \"The 4th Man\" and the awesome \"Starship Troopers\", directs with amazing skill and energy, and injects a vein of black humor that elevates this to levels way beyond previous genre watersheds. No masterpiece lacks a brilliant screenplay, and the screenplay here is just that. Few science fiction films in history have so masterfully combined great ideas with violent action, sharp characterization and jaw-dropping special effects. The film's most brutal set piece -- the gunning down of Murphy (Peter Weller) -- is one of cinema's most harrowing and tragic achievements, a hard, cruel punch to the gut and emotions that sweeps us into the film's amazing second act. The performances are flawless, the villains are incredibly mean-spirited, and the special visual and make-up effects are superb. If you want to know how to make great science fiction, \"Robocop\" is a great place to start." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Ahhh...Robocop. How I've missed you. The tale of one man's death and rebirth into a formidable robotic killing machine really tugs at my heartstrings. From the brilliant action scenes (Clarence running down Emil and turning him into a splash of toxic sludge is genius), to the acting (Miguel Ferrier is especially good here as Bob Morton, Robocop's creator. Too bad he bought the farm halfway through the film. Maybe he can come back in Robocop 4 as an apparition?), the actors themselves (Peter Weller does an admirable job as Robo, and Nancy Allen is still hot, no matter what anyone says), and even the in-jokes about corporate control and capitalism, you can't help but love this film. Everyone should see it immediately. Bottom Line: Watch this and not the two sub-par sequels that followed...but you could try watching the TV series. Or the cartoon series. If you want." "I've a very personal connection to RoboCop. It's been my favourite movie since I first saw it 25 years ago and was also the first truly adult film I'd seen at that time in my life. It's extreme violence shocked me and left and indelible mark, it's vile, memorable villains, breakneck pace and frenetic action were like nothing I'd ever seen. I have revisited the film at various ages over the years and have regularly reappraised it, each time trying to gauge it objectively without the haze of nostalgia. Whilst other movies I loved in my youth now rate far less favourably with me when viewed as an adult, RoboCop is as good now as it was all those years ago. As an adult I now clearly see the deeper thematic elements such as the commentary on 80's corporate greed and Verhoven's Christ allegory of Murphy's crucifixion and resurrection. The most powerful aspects of the movie are some of the more emotional elements such as Murphy's \"I can feel them, but I can't remember them\" scene and Murphy going to the abandoned family home, all played with perfectly balanced pathos by Peter Weller who puts in a career best performance in a very difficult, unconventional acting role. The script and editing are second to none. It careens from one classic scene to another yet is perfectly paced. There is no scene that feels surplus to requirements, no fat on the meat. It's tone is also very unique, due in no greater part to its director's style. Verhoven employs a hyper-realism, gun shot wounds look as horrific as they would in real life, the use of a non-scripted crash team to work on saving Murphy after he's shot, all these things give a pleasing sheen of authenticity to the film. Special mention must go to the film's technical aspects, namely the great production design and the RoboCop suit designed by Rob Bottin who also did the film's superb practical effects. The designs of RoboCop's suit and Craig Davies' imposing ED-209 have aged extremely well and have a timeless quality. And let's not forget Basil Poledouris' majestic score. It perfectly complements the film and is both equal parts rousing and mournfully melodic. One of the things RoboCop is most famous for is the aforementioned violence and indeed it is uber violent but the violence is an intrinsic factor that adds to the film's unique quality. Never before had such brutal, graphic, sadistic violence been portrayed in a major Hollywood movie. Again this is Verhoven's doing. Coming from Holland where there was no equivalent of the MPAA he was able to do as he wished as a film maker in his native country. He grew up during the Nazi occupation of Holland and violence was something he saw frequently and this shows in much of his work and none more so than here where it is used to great effect to instill sympathy in Murphy's character who doesn't get a great amount of screen time before being so brutally killed and it also paints this future Detroit as a cold merciless place. It never feels excessive when seen in context of the movie but is certainly not for the faint hearted. Whilst on the subject, special mention must go to Kurtwood Smith's exceptionally vile and sadistic Clarence Boddiker, easily a contender for Best Movie Villain Ever. RoboCop is very much a product of the 80's, particularly Reagan's 80's America and this is in no way to its detriment. Indeed as the recent neutered, generic, typically modern Hollywood remake shows, they'd never be able to make a film this visceral these days. It even manages to be strangely prophetic - the real city of Detroit recently filing bankruptcy and Downtown Dallas, Houston, where the bulk of it was filmed now more than ever looking like the Old Detroit seen in the film. The film has in it's arsenal, amongst other things, an incredible, almost mythical third act which is more Western than Sci-Fi. From the point where Lewis goes back to the Steel Mill to bring Murphy supplies the film starts to peak and doesn't let up until the incredibly satisfying final scene which scored off the chart with test audiences causing the originally planned final Media Break ending to be dropped leaving the \"Nice shooting son, what's your name?\" ending we have now. For me this film has it all, a great script with endlessly quotable dialogue, great performances across the board, great effects that service the film instead of acting as a distraction, a superb score, perfect editing, a classic revenge theme, The Greatest Film Location Ever (The Old Steel Mill), the list goes on. I'll finish with this, don't look beyond the original RoboCop as it's greatness is only sullied by the poor sequels and dire TV series that followed. Instead see it as it should have remained, an undiluted classic, a masterpiece of modern film making with wit, brutality but also a very clearly defined soul. Nice shooting indeed!" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "There is a cornucopia of action scenes in this movie, so the Arnold Schwarzenegger demographic won't be disappointed. Guns of every type are deployed and powerful semi-automatic pistols are the least of them. There are heavily armed robots weighing a ton that walk with reverberating thumps. There's a van with a murderer at the wheel that embeds itself into a huge tank labeled \"Toxic Waste\" and we see the driver melt before our eyes. And then there's Peter Weller as the half-human cyborg cop, ripped apart by bullets, reassembled with electronic components by villainous Ronnie Cox who heads the OCP corporation. When this first showed up on television I caught a few minutes of Weller's titanium-coated figure blasting some people to pieces and thought, \"Oh, (expletive deleted), another comic strip hero brought to life.\" But, having just watched it through, I think it's rather more than just another mindless superhero story. Neither the director, Paul Verhoeven, nor his two writers ever went anywhere after this, but they hit the ball with \"Robocop\" as typical action movie, black comedy, and social commentary. The opening is hilarious. It's a satire on the evening news. Two handsome, cheerful faces -- one bland guy and one Leeza Gibbons who looks like she could eat a man alive -- run through the news of the world in the near future -- riots here and there, police strikes, a war at the Mexican border, and so on. Cut to a commercial for some heart transplant business. Some huckster with silvery hair, a television actor's voice, and a white coat and stethoscope takes us through the corporation's offices, telling us we get to choose our own heart at a discount price, even \"the Jarvik model,\" and he grins and holds up a model of the artificial heart, which looks like two pink plastic concertinas glued together. \"And remember -- we care.\" Another commercial advertises the new Model 6000 \"Sux\" car, which boasts 8.2 miles to the gallon. Later, the news anchors tell us about a tragic incident in which dozens of satellites forming a missile shield (\"the Peace Platform\") have gone awry and struck the earth with lasers, killing more than one hundred people -- a human tragedy. And who built the lasers? OCP. \"Hell, we practically are the military,\" remarks Cox. Everything is being privatized. \"The military/industrial complex\" has become \"the militaryindustrial complex.\" The corporation runs everything. Hospitals, construction, social control, security, \"urban pacification\", energy, the whole magilla. And OCP makes worse mistakes than the government, if that's possible. At a board meeting, Cox introduces a two-ton super robot that will replace human cops. To demonstrate, he has a board member hold a gun. The robot orders him to put down the gun, giving him fifteen seconds to comply. The frightened suit complies but somehow the robot continues its countdown. The two dozen other board members dive out of the way as the robot blasts the innocent victim to bloody shreds. \"A big glitch,\" somebody mutters. Nobody mentions the dead man. It's just that the failure makes the company look bad. The basic plot has Peter Weller, who is only half a man, slowly recovering his memory and his identity. As he goes about obeying orders and trying to enforce the law, he's smitten by all sorts of objects and weapons. He's not entirely invulnerable either. Like Achilles, he has a vulnerable spot -- his lips and cheeks -- that never seem to suffer any damage. And he's human enough to bleed when his armor is punctured. By the end, he's removed his helmet so that we can see Weller's hairless face and part of his head. He's recovered his memory completely too. He answers to the name of Murphy and even smiles. A dreadful thought occurs to me at this point. With it's sour view of privatization and corporate culture, in some sectors of social space this is going to be interpreted as socialist propaganda. That's not actually the case, though. OCP is run by the avuncular and well-meaning old Dan O'Herlihy. The flies in the corporate ointment are Ronnie Cox, Miguel Ferrer, and the smarmy henchmen they hire to do their wet work and their cocaine running. The henchmen are led by Kurtwood Smith, who has never done anything on screen but lead henchmen. When you see Kurtwood Smith headed your way, you know there's trouble. You just don't know whether it will be prolonged and debilitating like prostate cancer or quick and painless like a severe stroke. The modern screen is full of splinter-group villains. They've included Russians, the IRA, and the CIA. Not the originals but some violent cabal within the group. Let's not offend anyone who might buy a ticket. Still -- inside this prototypical, titanium-coated, two-ton action movie behemoth there is a humanitarian trying to get out. And I get down on my knees and grovel in gratitude that the writers and director had the decency never to let Weller's half-human face show any tears, not even during the moments that were nearest the sentimental." "Spoilers Ahead: Want to appreciate this treasure? Watch the lobotomized, badly acted, boring piece of crap sequel. Look, if you are so inventive, could you stop stealing our movies and turning them into crap? Put down the comic book, write something original like this generation did. An action movie rises or falls predicated upon its villains; this has two excellent ones Dick Jones and Clarence. They can act, by the way, as can Weller. He doesn't look and sound like he had a massive stroke with a glassy eyed, dumb ass stare. Verhoeven fills the movie with biting, trenchant satire the breadth of the entire 80s Yuppies culture. Weller makes you care about him with his acting ability coupled with the real suffering Clarence and the boys mete out to him. The alliance between Jones and Clarence is well developed and understandable not introduced and then disappearing; I don't know maybe they ran out of crayons for the new script? When you compare both of the Vorhoeven's treasures that were bastardized by the lobotomies, this and Total Recall, what you notice, right away, is the drop in intellectual content. This movie is not just a great action picture; note, it contains action, not four scenes, two of which are training exercises. The acting, writing and directing are so superior. Satire requires much more intelligence than a straightforward narrative. This movie moves very well, has biting satire with great humor. Ferrer's Bob Morton is worth owning the movie for, what a depiction of a cut throat take no prisoners executive. I will be honest with you, it was after watching the abomination that is the remake, that I really appreciated this movie more. As soon as I was done, I put this one in to cleanse my mind. Yes, all of Vorhoeven's movies are quite violent, this is certainly no exception. It also is quite intense, fast moving and you will not be bored for one minute. Even with the dated effects, the dialog is funny and sarcastic. Weller's acting ability dwarfs lobotomy boy. The new guy has this expressionless insouciance devoid of one scintilla of inflection in his voice. For everyone who has not seen the remake, watch it then watch this over, believe me, you will have a new found respect for Vorhoeven's film. Cox out-acts Keaton badly in comparison, it is not even close. The real difference is the intelligence of the writing: everything is in the proper place and depth. We get his assembly but it doesn't consume half the movie. Also, his trip back to his family is but a detour here, in the remake it eats twenty minutes out of the film. You have no idea how utterly brain dead the remake is until you revisit this movie. All the cutting jabs at our culture, the intense corporate infighting and throat cutting which gave the original its bite has been castrated out of the remake. This movie is also free of the Deus Ex Machina ontology for retards that we have to endure in the remake. Look, it is RoboCop not Being and Nothingness? They think if they throw ontological babble at you it makes up for a boring, badly acted piece of crap. The cast and the writing are the stars of this film. Weller, Cox, Ferrer and Kurtwood Smith tower over the cheese ball group of a no talented ensemble with the exception of Oldman. Keaton is so lost in the remake; hey, he tried menacing in Pacific Heights, it is out of his range, Hello? Do yourself a big favor, make yourself watch the Curious George version of RoboCop before you re-watch this classic. A Very Good Cutting Satire. \"A Wise Man Strives For Clarity; A Fool For Obscurity.\" Schopenhauer" "In future Detroit, the crime rate has gone through the roof, the police are on strike and a private corporation has taken over the police force. After the death of one of their rookie officers (Peter Weller), they try some experimental surgery and create RoboCop. This film is vastly underrated, perhaps due in part to the stinky sequels. The plot is brilliant, the political undertones are there... we have action, we have science fiction, perhaps even a touch of horror. There are the intentional metaphors and symbolism that hark back to Frankenstein and even Jesus Christ. I will not even begin to talk about privatization... The cast and crew are quite impressive. Rob Bottin, quite possibly the best special effects wizard in history, was there to see things through and gave us such excellent moments as \"the incredible melting man\". The incredible Nancy Allen, in one of her landmark performances (and maybe her best outside a Brian DePalma film). And Wisconsin's own Peter Weller. Hard to believe Orion studio head Mike Medavoy pushed for Arnold Schwarzenegger. Big mistake, and we are fortunate Weller won the role. What is really amusing is how they used the backdrop of Detroit, rather than one of the more traditional film settings. Because, as we all know, Detroit today (2010-2015) is a crime-ridden cesspool. I find it hard to believe that this film shows life all that much worse than it really is in Detroit today. The film has been released in various formats, including from the Criterion Collection. The MGM 20th Anniversary edition DVD is particularly strong. The list of features is almost endless, and the double disc offers two versions of the film. And, of course, the excellent audio commentary. All that really remains is the possibility of upgraded picture and sound. (A blu-ray release may have that already.)" "This is one of the best science fiction films ever made. Unfortunately, neither the sequels nor a T.V series could top this entertaining mix of action,humor and emotion. Robocop 2 relied a little too much on action and not enough emotion. Robocop 3 could have been good if they had written a better storyline and script. The story in 3 just did not work out with audiences, and that's why it got such negative reviews. If there ever is a Robocop 4 i hope that they bring back Paul Verhoven, The director of the first. Maybe he can help bring Robocop back to life. The producers could not wait to make sequels and that is why they weren't like the original" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This movie is about as close to perfection as one gets. It has a great story, great acting (good emotion on the part of Weller as Robo), the amount of violence is perfect (not over-the-top like Robocop 2, not too watered down like Robocop 3). The villains (both the street thugs and the wealthy businessmen) are so dangerous than they're downright scary in their ruthlessness, and the heroes are brave (though a bit too red, white and blue). It's the kind of film that inspires one to be righteous, and stronger, and in some situations, it may even persuade you to become a cop :) There are deeper meanings to it also. The shame of big business is obvious as it explicitly described how OCP gives cops inferior products, like faulty body armor that are said to not work, in the hopes that the police will go on strike and, as a result, OCP will have a very lucrative contract to provide the city with \"security\" (ie, protection for the rich). There's commentaries about the cheapness of human life, as well as one about corruption (a criminal who's the suspect in over 30 cop deaths being allowed out of jail in 24 hours?!) *****SPOILERS***** It's not ironic that there wasn't any backup when Murphy and Lewis confronted Clarence Bodicker's (sp) violent gang, but there was an army of cops readily available after Dick Jones called for help when Robo and the larger robot were trashing through his office. Why wasn't that army of cops available to take down Bodicker's gang, one asks? For same reason as above with the faulty body armor, where the hope is that cops will quit their post if they perceive it to be too dangerous and OCP will be granted absolute power by a scared population that *thinks* the company is looking out for the masses. Though, I must say, the one bit is when Murphy and Lewis decide to go after a gang of 8 violent robbers when they're told there's no back-up? I think NOT. There's brave and then there's stupid, and that kind of behavior is crossing the line towards the latter."

Of course, being only 10 at the time, and brought up on a TV diet of kids cartoons, I was completely traumatised by the experience. This lead to months of nightmares about people dissolving in toxic waste, and me becoming terrified of the twitchy microwave in our kitchen. Thanks Teach!! Anyway, Now I am 35, completely desensitised to violence in films and I stumbled across this on Netflix and decided to watch it again with adult perspective, to see if I really hated it as much as I thought I did. It is as gory as I remember so anyone looking for lots of blood, squishy corpses and explosions, this is the film for you! It hasn't aged well, but some of the effects are still decent. It is fun to revisit the 80s and all that 80's cheesy dialogue, obsolete technology and ridiculous bad guys, complete with a greedy, evil corporation running the show. Definitely worth a watch if you are into this genre. I'll be interested to see how the remake turns out." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "1987 was a significant year for action, sci-fi, and horror films, and on-screen violence conveyed as shocking, grotesque imagery moved many members of a more juvenile audience that year and more to follow. Paul Verhoven's \"Robocop\" is a perfect example of an excessively violent comic book sci-fi fantasy box office smash. Its a film that engraved itself into the consciousnesses of minds such as my own with a very modern interpretation of villains and archetypal heroes, good versus evil, and science versus humanity. Peter Weller is perfectly cast as good-hearted policeman, Alex Murphy, newly transferred to a futuristic Detroit where corporations rule, and crime has taken its toll. After he is cut down by ruthless bad guys, Murphy undergoes a transformation into a cybernetic super-cop equipped with the latest and greatest of futuristic technology, and must eventually take revenge against the gangsters that took away his human identity and confront his adversaries protected by the corporate hierarchy. Verhoven's vision is one of sheer brilliance, unexpectedly utilizing extreme violence to depict a world of viciousness and moral desensitization. Murphy's horrifying murder is so graphic, that it only sets the stage for his later exercises in revenge and retribution. The cast is absolutely top-notch, with Nancy Allen as Murphy's tough but caring partner, Ronny Cox as a white collar shark businessman, Miguel Ferrer as an amoral and ambitious executive, and Kurtwood Smith who steals the show as one of the most detestably amusing villains in modern movie history, Clarence Boddicker. Superb directorial touches include excellent point-of-view camera work, hilarious spoof-style in-movie commercials and news reels, and plenty of twisted dialog and comic relief. Weller's performance provides the man versus machine human story and the ED-209 prototype (although stop-motion FX seem dated), is a blast. \"Robocop\" is a solid example of a coming of age tale of brutality and bloodshed, giving audiences of the extreme action genre exactly what it came for with plenty of surprises and no-holds-barred thrills. With all the computer graphics and 3D enhancements of today, they just don't make them like this anymore, and when Robo unleashes his fury on old Detroit, you'll buy that for a dollar! The unrated Director's cut is the way to go, with the extended Murphy killing (complete with rotating camera head shot). Verhoven will go on to direct \"Total Recall\" and \"Basic Instinct\" and Peter Weller and the surviving cast will return for an entertaining sequel, \"Robocop 2\"." "The 1980's were and are a treasure trove for action movie lovers who were blessed with an abundance of classic action tales ranging from Terminator, Lethal Weapon, Die Hard and countless other flicks that looked to take names and ask questions later. Dutch wild child Paul Verhoeven's 1987 bout of robotic justice can sit proudly alongside those classic entries as a shamelessly fun and over the top piece of blood infused entertainment. For some unbeknown reason I have in my many years of film watching never seen Peter Weller strut his stuff as Alex Murphy a man who becomes our titular Robocop (a fact made all the more shameful on my behalf considering I was holed up working in a video store for more than 5 years) but I am glad I have now rectified that problem. Robocop is a film filled with subtle smarts and ingenious ideas that were fantastically realised by Verhoeven with some ripping makeup design and typically brutal 1980's action scenes littering the picture. There is an air of fun and playfulness throughout the picture that are all infrequent in today's action films with Robocop not afraid to lighten the mood along with mixing in themes that are more meaningful and heartfelt, a mood that is heightened by a cast full of colourful and committed actors. Peter Weller in the role he will always be remembered for is great as our hero Murphy, playing the man and machine with an always calm yet readily menacing presence. As he quips his way through the movie we are always on his side and that's without the film bothering with much exposition at all. Other actors in the piece from Nancy Allen's female cop Anne and Kurtwood Smith's downright slimy Clarence J. Boddicker. All make their characters there's which fits in fantastically with Verhoeven's at times ingenious direction. When you watch Robocop today you really get the sense that even though it has now happened a remake/reboot is entirely unnecessary with the original still standing up in today's standards and still packing both a punch in the entertainment and social commentary stakes. If you're thinking about going to see the new Robocop why not just watch the original instead? As they say the original is always the best. 4 steps out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com" "When I look at the modern day West, and the 2008 financial crisis, I often see parallels with images from RoboCop: protests, mind-numbing commercials, crime as the result of huge poverty, profit as the main goal of life, no matter at what (or whose) expense. There is not one OCP today, but dozens of OCPs, huge modern mega-corporations that influence every aspect of the society and drain it of its wealth. Just like in RoboCop, the middle class is almost gone and we only have the poor and the rich. RoboCop started out as a pure B-movie, but unlike Cyborg (1989) or The Six Million Dolar Man (1974), it kept its relevance, satire and sharpness precisely because it is so close to today that it hurts. Even as a kid, I somehow got that one of the messages of the film was how the power was slowly shifting from the government to the OCP. Let's be fair, though, Verhoeven sometimes directs a scene in a heavy, clumsy manner, and some cheap ideas slightly reduce my enjoyment whenever I re-watch this. Overall, this is still a strong film, and I stand behind what I say. Kurtwood Smith is one of the most fiendish villains of the 80s, and one of the most unorthodox ones, too, with those glasses, but we must also mention Peter Weller who is often overlooked under that armor, yet his stoic presence tells us everything we need to know. His Murphy is a character designed by the corporations, a being that is a product, not a being anymore. The way he finds his humanity, nonetheless, is still powerful. He defies the system, he defies the cold exploitation - and he becomes worthy to become recognized. And the ED-something-something robot is still cool as ever, too." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "For starters Robocop is an underrated and misunderstood movie by many. Yet if you watch this movie and see passed the dark sense of humour and ultra violence there is a story which is reflective of our world today. Robocop is a satire and a well thought out one at that. OCP represent the big corporations, Robocop/Murphy represents the human spirit and this is the irony of the movie that despite Murphy becoming almost entirely machine by the company they could not destroy his human side. Murphy did not become a mindless, emotionless product that is Robocop!! His human emotional side was still too strong and Murphy's emotional journey as Robocop and losing his contact with his family give this movie depth which makes the original movie vastly superior to the hollow sequels that followed. So the analogy here is business, power, money and technology attempt to dehumanise mankind but showing that eventually human spirit will win the day and essentially this aspect is most important in life. An increasing focus in today's society I believe. In the final sequence of the movie this is emphasised by the Old Man asking Robocop what his name is, to which he replies 'Murphy'!. He was no longer the machine he was Alex Murphy the man! OK so I have now analysised this movie at its core but on a more superficial level this movie is fantastic action flick with humour added in bundles. It has some very violent scene which will stick in the memory especially the murder of Murphy. The Robocop suit special effects are brilliant, with his machine pistol style handgun being iconic and symbolic of the Robocop character. The acting is very solid and believable. The stop motion effects of ED-209 are probably not up to today's standards but in my eyes give the movie an authentic 80's feel and add to its charm. The action sequences are all great and no shot in the movie is wasted and all of it is relevant. The adverts in the movie and news sequences also adds to the satirical value of the movie and give the movie a dark humour. This is a movie I would recommend to all sci-fi and action fans but I warn you this is not a movie for the faint hearted as it contains uncompromising violence and lots of foul language. Most importantly though this is a movie that has more depth than meets the eye and is really giving a message to the more observant viewer but can also cater for the more shallow movie watcher. This is a shame because Robocop is much more than guns, blood and bad language. Its a satire of the modern world and I highly recommend it!!" "Every now and then a film comes out with so much action and mayhem, that an audience member cannot tell weather they were anesthetized from the drama or made to feel numb from the killings and body count. I saw this film in the surround-sound theater and the explosions and gunfire sent me into a tail-spin. It was a good action film, but the level of ambivalent destruction reached a peak when one of the characters spoke of the deceased as a 'product' and not as a human being. The tale of \"Robo-Cop\" begins when our hero Officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) signs up to be a candidate for the Robo-cop project. A gang of vicious thugs, headed by Clarece Boddicker, (Kurtwood Smith) are on a murderous rampage through 'old Detroit' and have little compunction to kill police at every opportunity. One such opportunity occurs when Officer Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen) accidentally allows her partner to be gun-down and left for dead. Thus initiating the transformation from ordinary cop to Law Enforcement Robot, created by O.C.P. headed by none other than Dan O'Herlihy as President. Ronny Cox is superb as Dick Jones, VP. at O.C.P. But he is about to be rivaled by up and coming Bob Morton. (Miguel Ferrer) Great film. ****" "Quick, what do Peter Weller, Ray Wise, and Paul McCrane have in common? If you say they were all in RoboCop, you're all halfway there. What they also have in common was they all were in Day 5 of \"24\" (with McCrane's role partly expanded to Day 6). Besides those names other familiar faces include Ronny Cox (Beverly Hills Cop series), Nancy Allen (ex-husband Brian De Palma movies, I Wanna Hold Your Hand), Miguel Ferrer (\"Twin Peaks\"), and, in the movie's best role, Kurtwood Smith (\"That '70s Show\") as the main villain, Clarence Boddicker. While partially predictable, RoboCop has some of the most badass action in movie history with wonderful humorous touches throughout. Director Paul Verhoeven really keeps a constant pace during the chase scenes. Check out Leeza Gibbons as one of the news anchors in the TV clip sequences. This movie is most highly recommended." "Paul Verhoeven's \"Robocop\" looks and sounds a lot like James Cameron's \"The Terminator\" (1984) on initial glance, with a mechanized, half-man/half-machine creation placed inside an ultra-violent action plot. The key difference is: whereas Cameron doesn't have a satirical bone in his body, Dutch director Verhoeven does, and transforms \"Robocop\" into a fine-tuned blend of futurist comedy and riveting action violence. Detroit cop Murphy (Peter Weller) is ambushed and brutally executed by a gang of thugs (headed by Kurtwood Smith!); left for dead, he is seized upon by a corporate creep (Miguel Ferrer, patenting his sleazy screen persona) who transforms him into the titular character--a seemingly perfect and unstoppable crime-fighting machine. It goes without saying that there are more than a few complications, and when Robocop suffers flashbacks of Murphy's death, his world is turned upside-down. Verhoeven's sense of frenetic action direction is matched by the incisive satire of corporate politics, where money-hungry vultures like Ferrer and Ronny Cox subsidize gangsters and drug manufacturers; similarly, the vision of future-media (while outdated with its distinctly '80s fonts and graphics) possesses a sarcastic, desensitized attitude that is ironically fitting (the malfunction of a satellite that laser-fries 100 from space is shrugged off as no big deal)...and could there be a bit of foreshadowing to our SUV-obsessed populace that the car everyone wants is an SUX 6000? It may look like a conventional sci-fi/action flick on the surface, but \"Robocop\" has an intellectual pulse that makes its thrills all the more satisfying." "This is a very good film. It was excellent in the 80s, and it's excellent today. It ages so very well. Satirical, bathetic, funny, heroic, worrying, sharp... it goes on and on. Maybe in a few more years, this film will be viewed with increasing amazement, at being so very prophetic.... and salutary. The music is good, too. You probably don't notice it with first viewing, but later, you do. All the acting performances are good, and in later years we saw some of the actors reappear in prominent roles, but they never rang true as they were all bad baddies in Robocop. The only problem is that Weller has to go around for most of it with his face mostly covered. Such a waste. stay out of TROUBLE." "Law enforcement is a dangerous job for all police at the best of times. That is no more apparent than in the 1987 science-fiction movie, Robocop. After seeing this movie a few times I appreciate what it must be like to be a cop and what it is like to be the target of criminals, and at the mercy of the public they are protecting. Robocop allows us to see first-hand what it means to have your life 'robbed' away from you, then what it takes to right the wrong that has been committed. When a good cop, Alex Murphy, gets blown away by some ruthless criminals, innovative scientists and doctors are able to piece him back together as an unstoppable crime-fighting cyborg called 'Robocop'. Impervious to bullets and bombs, and equipped to with high-tech weaponry, Robocop quickly makes a name for himself by cleaning up the crime-ridden streets of violence-ravaged Detroit. But despite his new, hardened exterior, Robocop is tormented by scraps of memory of his former life, and relives vivid nightmares of his own death at the hands of the vicious killers. Now he is out to seek more than justice.he wants revenge! I am fascinated by Robocop director Paul Verhoeven. His direction style is pretty good, with his most famous work being Basic Instinct, a movie I did like. I am sure that this movie took along time to direct, and I also know that Verhoeven was very 'hands-on' directing it. However he has a very weird mind, especially with his obsession about the crucifix. In Robocop, Verhoeven said 'I wanted to show Satan killing Jesus', in reference to the character of Alex Murphy. I question this man's morals and values, as they are very confronting. His fascination with violence is also a very hard thing to understand. The other people involved in making 'Robocop' were screenwriters Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner, who wrote a wonderful script for this movie. The hero of the film was especially well written. The people who were involved in making the 'Robocop' suit, had an arduous task, but did it beautifully. The suit was designed by Rob Bottin. I am sure he would have had to put a lot of thought into what and how the suit would be like. Actor Peter Weller had the difficult, but enviable task of being Police Officer Alex Murphy/Robocop. I feel that he was a great choice for being 'the knight in shining armor'. The way he makes us believe that he is a robot is terrific, as is the way that he brings a human side to his other personality. I recently saw Weller in the movie 'Styx', starring alongside Aussie actor Bryan Brown. 'Robo's' partner is female cop Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen). Her character remains loyal to Robocop, because when other people believe Alex Murphy is 'dead', Lewis knows her old partner is inside that machine somewhere. There are some really bad characters in Robocop. Robert 'Bob' Morton (Miguel Ferrier) would seem to be on the side of good, as he is the one responsible for making 'a man become a robot'. However it also evident that he is only doing it for his own gain. The meanest character on this film was a man by the name of Clarence Boddicker, (Kurtwood Smith). His character has no conscience, as he goes around Detroit killing innocent cops without blinking an eye. He is doing this under the evil instructions of OCP employee Richard 'Dick' Jones (Ronny Cox). By the end of the movie you are willing that Dick and the bad guy are blown away by Robocop. I would describe the scenes to this movie as being either 'gruesome or heroic'. Alex Murphy's death is one of the most challenging pieces of cinema I have ever seen, as was the introduction of Police robot 'Ed 209'. When Ed goes haywire, killing an innocent man, once again the violence is very confronting for the audience. This scene also shows the subtle use of comedy. After shutting down the robot, a person calls out for a 'paramedic' to help the dead man. This was very humorous, as the man was more than just 'dead', and makes what was something so violent seem to be just a joke. By the end this movie, I felt very desensitised by the violence, as if it were commonplace. This movie also has some heroic scenes. All of the screen time with Robocop seemed to make him feel like a hero, as we are all willing him to do his job, by being a tough indestructible police officer. My favourite two 'Robo-scenes' are one, when Robocop confronts one of his killers at a 'Shell' gas station, and two, when our hero uncovers a major drug raid, again involving the scum that ended Alex Murphy. I also like the soundtrack to 'Robocop'. The Robocop 'march' highlights the status of our hero and these scenes. Yet we are also made to feel for this cyborg. I like how we see him revisit his former home, and what affect his 'human brain' has. This robot is still very vulnerable and disturbed by what has happened to him in the past as a human. It is a known fact that people hated working on this movie, which is understandable. I am sure it would have been demanding, on and off screen. Peter Weller also openly admitted that being 'Robocop' was the worst experience of his acting life, simply because of the costume that he had to wear. I was not surprised to hear that. Yet he gave the Robocop figure great 'heart' which it needed. This movie will test your threshold for violence, as it is 'cynical and unblinking'. It will also make you feel good, as the main star is a 'likeable' robot. Watch out for the wonderful DVD which is now available for this movie. For an 80's movie, Robocop was a very good one.

"Sharp, ultra-violent (particularly the director's cut) and undeniably funny (if you're into this kind of) action/science fiction set in a not too distant Detroit, Michigan future (though actually filmed in Houstan, Texas) where crime runs rampant and people sell out regularly for the sake of the all mighty dollar. One particularly annoying criminal is Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith, who later went on to play the cranky dad Red Foreman on TV's \"That 70s Show\") a sadistic drug dealer who secretly works for OCP (Omni-Consumer Products) 2nd in command Dick Jones (Ronny Cox). Jones tries to sell a new state of the art security robot called ED-209 (Enforcement Droid), but ED malfunctions and kills a young executive during demonstration so the Old Man/OCP President (Daniel O'Herlihy) gives the green light to up and comer Bob Morton's (a much younger Miguel Ferrer who actually has hair) ROBOCOP program, which is supposed to blend a dead policeman's flesh and experience with those of a machine. Later that day, family man Police Offer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is brutally mutilated by Clarence and his gang of sadistic scum-bags, much to the horror of his lady partner Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen). Murphy is then resurrected with a blanked memory as Robocop, a hulking, 6-foot tall cyborg, heavily armored and wielding a big gun. After being unveiled and thwarting a machine gun toting convenience store robber (who tries to pick up an Iron Man comic book along with the robbery), shooting a rapist in the balls and throwing a blood thirsty ex-city councilman out of a window thus saving the mayor, Robocop becomes a sensation and security factor in securing revitalizing Old Detroit as part of a big city project (Delta City or something). This angers Jones and he swears revenge on Morton. Later Robocop (who only Lewis recognizes as Murphy) has a dream/flashback to his brutal murder which freaks out his personal technicians before he goes off for his nightly patrol. While out on patrol he encounters Emil (Paul McCrane), one of Clarence's thugs while he's robbing and terrorizing a gas station attendant and, after a voice from beyond the grave moment, the gas station is blown sky high and Robocop shoots down Emil's bike, demanding his identity. Later Robocop checks out Emil and his known accomplices, which leads to him coming across Clarence and one of his murdered victims, Alex Murphy. After Robocop goes back to his old home and regains enough memories of his previous life to realize that HE IS Murphy, he becomes enraged and hellbent on beating the crap out of Clarence and his minions any which way he can. The only thing standing in his way are his prime directives - 1) Serve the public trust, 2) Protect the Innocent, 3) Uphold the law and \"Directive 4\" (no attackng senior OCP staff members), OCP man Jones and ED-209. Did I mention that the other cops are trying to go on strike? Naturally, since this is a feel good 80s movie, Robocop naturally triumphs over evil and destroys Clarence and his minions. Peter Weller is mesmerizing as Robocop, Kurtwood Smith is a threatening villain (my ability to enjoy this film has been hampered somewhat by Smith's role on \"That 70s Show\") and Jones is a charming villain. Nancy Allen does capable work as Lewis. Sadly, what could have been a great franchise was ruined by kid oriented toy marketing, \"Robocop 2\", which had a plot that just didn't go anywhere, the unnecessary presence of a sadistic, foul mouthed boy who we're expected to feel sorry for when he dies and an obnoxious, manipulative conniving little bitch who doesn't get her just desserts played by Belinda Bauer (who's only acting ability IS conniving little bitch) and \"Robocop 3\" which turned Robocop into a joke and didn't even feature Peter Weller as Robocop. At least \"Robocop 2\" had some cool action scenes and cool music Leonard Rosenbaum (or Rosenman, I forget how you spell his name). Still, \"Robocop 1\" is a classic of the action/science fiction genre and features numerous memorable pot shots at capitalism run rampant along with the whole humanity VS technology thing and when it stops being a machine and becomes a person. Music by Basil Pouldouris, who also did the music for \"Conan the Barbarian\". Stand out stop motion special effects by Phil Tippet." "Robocop along with Lethal Weapon and Predator were the three action films of 1987. Robocop is about a law officer(peter weller) who is killed on the line of duty and is resurrected by a greedy company called OCP(omni consumer products)and the man responsible is Bob(Miguel Ferrer) who is being challanged by Dick Jones(Ronny Cox) with the same idea but different structures. Dick has his own design called Ed-209, a 10 foot robot with cannons the size of gas tanks for pick up trucks. With Robocop in action, the city is safe, until his past as a human gets him to get even with the people that kill him. great action movie with funny dialogue and humor along the way, Robocop proves to be one of the greatest action movies ever made." "Paul Verhoven, who originally turned this project down, must have known what a big joke this film was going to be if made right. But exactly right is how he's made it, as it's the kind of joke that one wants to get told by someone who knows how to tell it, so that one can remember how it goes to tell the next guy. It lays in its satire in sharp stabs that are wickedly dead-on, as far as consumerism and living in a state of decay by the media and complete omniscient (and sinister in playing both sides) corporate control goes, with commercials for 'Nukem', a variation on battleship, and a dinosaur-attacking-a-city movie coming soon, which comes at the strangest of time in the story. In fact, RoboCop in a big way can be seen as the older cousin of Starship Troopers, and to a smaller extent Total Recall, Verhoven's other futuristic sci-fi ventures: the society itself, which is encompassed with authorities, the corporate interests, the criminals, the cops with their low morale and high body count (cops deaths, not criminals), lends itself to being led on to get dominated by technology. What RoboCop brilliantly posits is that when the human element is suppressed in a society driven head-on by mindless and lethal technology, it's bound to come out somehow in some form. Just so happens Murphy (Peter Weller) is that form. The simple lowdown: Murphy and his female cop partner are out chasing some bad guys, they track them down to a warehouse where Murphy is captured, shot repeatedly (his hand gets shot off first, then past the bullet proof vest), and killed...Or so it seems, as he's not totally dead, and is brought back to life, though not really. In a series of first-person perspectives- a real inventive way to show passage of time as well as a level of cynical manipulation in the guise of wild progress in making a human-robot- we see Murphy turned into Robocop, his arms replaced, a gridding and shooting system loaded in, and finally taking his first steps. Like any superhero, RoboCop is a kick-ass force to be reckoned with, and completely objective: he's there to serve and protect, and make the occasional PA for kids, \"Stay out of trouble.\" The same thugs from before however are still lurking around, and a run-in with one stirs memories, if not exactly feelings, of Murphy's demise, as well as the loss he feels for his wife and child. Little by little, a routine investigation/crackdown by Robocop turns into a sort of vendetta. This, unfortunately, stirs up wrath in the head of the OCP, who is, as luck would have it, also the boss of the big-hoodlums Robocop is after in Detroit's glummest of slums. It's worth to point out some of these story points, as Verhoven and the writers are actually very strong on pushing forward the story, but in a level that makes material that should be in a 25 cent pulpy comic book from the 50s into something more tangible. Like the Terminator, Verhoven keeps the adrenaline going forward as far as directing the action set-pieces, from small scenes with liquor store robberies, to a big crackdown of Clarence's drug operation, and to a scene involving many, many, many guns firing on Robocop in one fell swoop. But there's often an attitude to action, specifically the \"excessive violence\" (as the MPAA put it when it gave the film an X at first sight), that reminds the audience that it's bigger than life, like a movie should be like this, and at the same time graphic enough to point out the very chaotic nature of gang warfare. It's a thin line that Verhoven and his collaborators walk on and pull off tremendously, in making scenes that should be horribly horrific, like when the big walker-gun-machine is introduced and kills one of the board members, hilarious in the darkest possible way in how they unfold, and at the same time keep excitement to it, of the kind of danger one saw in Death Wish (and, like that film, Detroit's crime scene is probably not far from the one depicted here). And when it comes down to it too, RoboCop/Murphy is the kind of big-screen hero that audiences can get behind, if after a slight adjustment to the whole goof that comes in just picturing a Robocop before it comes on screen. There's tragedy inherent to Murphy's original demise, hence the sort of bitter edge of the first-person creation scenes, especially because Robocop's creators didn't work out making it a figure that is entirely robot. Programming stays the same, but the past ends up informing the character, and brings what is otherwise a walking bill-of-rights machine with a big (bleeping) gun to being human again, in its black-and-white manner. In his own kind of twisted way, this is for Verhoven what Brazil is for Terry Gilliam; a near-future plausible not for the advances in technology (or lack thereof), but because of human beings not being able to know how to function society, and what a consciousness in technology brings to the situation. This as well as each director's obsessions, in this case Verhoven's knack at shameless artifice, bigger than life bad guys, twists in the plot, and a lot of bombastic violence. And all the same, it's an rip-roaring adult popcorn movie, one of the best of 1987." "Remember watching this movie as a schoolboy at home on small TV screen from an old VHS-player. Through a very small TV-set, with crappy sound, and crappy picture. But it still blew me away. The story, the settings, the special effects, the dramatic events, the gloomy violence, and insane breaking of the law did not let my mind go from the first frames till the very last. There was information once in our Soviet magazines that the movie had been originally shown in the USA to people of 21 and older only. Wow! And the movie does not have any serious sexual material. A darn good movie. A sci-fi of the first rate. A classic. A little picture that changed my attitude to sci-fi action genre forever. \"The Terminator\", \"Predator\", \"RoboCop\", and a few others are really the iron fist of the genre. The biggest achievement of the American culture. Guess what? Yes, 10 out of 10. Sequels do not matter, but the original does big time. Thank you for attention." "Since I was born in the late seventies, I missed a lot of classic movies as a kid and in the eighties there just weren't made that many excellent movies. But if you ask me to name on of the movies that I saw then and which I still like, than chances are that it will be this \"Robocop\". It looked great back then, but still hasn't lost any of its power today. In a futuristic Detroit, violence is everywhere. The police department isn't able to react in a proper way and every week several officers get killed in the line of duty. But a private company called OPC may have come up with an excellent alternative for a police officer. They have developed E.D. 209, a powerful and huge crime fighting robot that can be used 24 hours a day. The only problem is that the robot doesn't always do its task correctly and sometimes shoots an innocent man. So it isn't used and the human cops will have to keep doing the dirty work. While Officer Alex J. Murphy goes on his first patrol, he is ambushed and shot by the feared gang leader and cop killer Clarence Boddicker. In the hospital they try to save Murphy's life, but when that appears to be impossible, his body is used by OPC to develop an entirely new robot. They use him to create the much better RoboCop. He is very successful against criminals, but when memories of his former life begin to surface, he starts looking for revenge... I guess that many people who now see this movie for the first time might say that some special effects could have been better. Especially the scenes with the E.D. 209 don't always look perfect (as long as it stands still, it all looks OK, but when it moves you see that the special effects weren't what they are today). Personally I didn't really have any problem with that because I kept in mind that this is still a movie from 1987. Let's be honest, in 20 years time today's special effects will probably look dated as well. But a good thing about this movie is that it didn't just rely on its special effects. The story is more than OK, and even though written almost two decades ago, still looks futuristic enough to be believable. A good thing about the story is also the fact that they don't mention a date. Some eighties Sci-Fi movies say: 'in the year 2002...' Back then that may have felt futuristic, special and believable, but when you see it today, you know that it wasn't like that at all in 2002. But what would a good story be without some good directing and acting? Absolutely nothing. It wouldn't be the first movie to fail completely because one of those things wasn't exactly great. But not in this case: Paul Verhoeven established his name in Hollywood with this movie (which is completely understandable, although he never came up with another movie that great.) and actors like Peter Weller and Nancy Allen also did a very good job (although they too weren't able to come up with another excellent project). In the end this is a Sci-Fi / action movie that really stands out above the average movie in the genre. Normally I'm not a fan of this kind of movies, but this time I'm willing to make an exception. The acting and the directing were very good, the story still feels futuristic enough and believable... That's why I give this movie a 7.5/10." "Robocop (1987) *** (out of 4) This extremely entertaining and original action picture was a box-office hit when first released even though the controversy of its violence would cause a firestorm even after the MPAA took out several seconds of footage. The film takes place in a crime filled Detroit where various psychopaths are killing cops at an alarming rate. One mastermind (Kurtwood Smith) has killed over two dozen cops and adds Murphy (Peter Weller) to his life. A local company, building for the future, takes what's left of Murphy and turns him into the machine Robocop. What they don't expect is for the robot to have memories of his human life and soon he sets out for revenge. I think the reason this movie grabbed crowds in 1987 and remains so fresh today is that the screenplay really went for broke and tried to mix everything it could. Not only is it sci-fi and action but we also get a lot of nice humor scattered throughout the ultra-violence and gore soaked story. It also helps that the screenplay was smart enough to make sure it builds up our human cop to where we care for him and want to see him get his revenge. It also helps that the bad guys here are among the greatest scum ever gathered in a movie. Smith is downright masterful as the head psycho and you can't help but want to see this guy beaten to a bloody pulp and the same holds true for his supporting cast. Weller is very good in his role as both the human cop as well as the machine. Nancy Allen also adds nice support even though her role isn't all that big. Verhoeven does a terrific job at building up this futuristic setting but he also manages to make it quite dark and moody. I think people forget what a great director he can be and he really puts his mark on this film and especially with the graphic violence. Seeing this thing in its R-rated form is certainly not the way too go even if you can't stomach the strong violence." "This is the original Robocop movie. It is still a very good movie, and it is much better than the new version. Many years have past since this came out, and it still deserves to be in the top. Many of the new versions of old movies that come out is missing some of the good feeling due to so much special effects, but they are not always needed to be a great movie. All is there. Action, Sorrow and the thoughts afterwords. The story is great and still and perhaps it is not so long in the future that we have these robot cops. The movie is about the police officer Alex Murphy, who somehow turned out to be a robot cop. He struggles with his past and present and the movie is really thoughtful these days were robots turn up everywhere. The special effects are not that good but when you think of when the movie was made it is no problem and the story makes you to forget all of that. Do not miss it." "My reasons to love Robocop : 1 - The interesting argument , savage capitalism , the high crime of a futuristic city ; corporate corruption , privatization, the struggle of good against evil, greed, technology development , cruel villains , the hero, the police loyalty, social criticism , and light humor. 2 - The impeccable direction of Paul Verhoeven . 3 - The excellent performances from the entire cast . 4 - The wonderful special effects , effective cinematography, beautiful music by Basil Poledouris ; and great editing . 5 - The spectacular action sequences, graphic violence , and brutal death scenes . 6 - A police flesh is killed, loses his family , then the hero is resurrected , his body is steel, and the new hero fights against the worst of society, throughout the process the hero has a new identity in the film takes the theme of revenge and amnesia. 7- Brain-computer interfacing in fiction. Robocop is a perfect action film and science fiction." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Unfortunately, for me, I didn't first get involved with the lovable Robocop until part 2 came out in 1990. Since I was a kid then, and trying to watch as many movies as I possibly could at that age, I had a good time with Robocop 2. Now, I think I've seen it only once since 1990 and not again in over two decades, so we'll see when I revisit that movie. I digress. Speaking about Robocop, the original  and not the not-anticipated-by-me remake in 2014, I was way too young to see this when it came out in theatres. Oh, and I was banned for most Rated-R flicks, unless my parents just had to see a Rated-R film and they had no babysitter. When I finally did, of course, I fell in love with it. It was the perfect 1980s action movie  make that, superhero movie. Yeah, Robocop is a superhero and the movie had all the eight stereotypical qualities of one: 1. Introduce a peaceful do-gooder and abruptly (and literally) shoot him down. 2. Reintroduce him with special powers. 3. Show just a handful of \"saving the public\" examples. 4. Our hero learns more about himself while inadvertently, inventing a smart, wealthy and obviously evil nemesis to take down our hero. 5. Shoot the hero down, again. 6. Show examples of the evil nemesis's, ah-hem, evilness. 7. Have hero learn and regain confidence...and muscle. 8. A SUPERHERO is born and comes back with a vengeance in the climax. Now, technically, I didn't spoil anything there. This is literally the formula for most superhero movies, including one of my all-time superhero movies, 1978's Superman: The Movie. Oh, and this movie is now 26 years old. Get with it, if you haven't seen it! Generally, in my reviews, I cover the synopsis. Since, I did above, I can move on. I truly loved this movie. It never seems to age for me whenever I revisit it. Sure, there's a few 80s technology/animation  mostly by ED-209  that I can't get past and no remake next year will make me side with them to correct any budget issues here. The lines were great, the action (ah-hem) explosive, the comedy funny, the heart attached and it truly defined that era of films. This movie, if it has to be remade, which it doesn't, deserves better follow-ups. The sequels  now thinking back on them  were comical and the TV seriesI didn't even bother. After seeing the trailer for the 2014 remake (not reboot, because, likely, it'll go nowhere or make that much,) I'm not enthused. But, sticking with this Robocop, it'll be a classic to the end of days. Side Note: My headline reads: Robopop. The reason? When I was young, and we had one TV with limited channels  never had cable until I moved out and there was this Bob Hope special on where in one segment, he dressed as Robocop, but was these kid's Robopop. I thought that was the funniest thing at the time and it's stuck with me since. Perhaps, I should YouTube that to see if someone else agrees with me Side Note II: Okay, not on YouTube, or Google But, I'll always have that memory. Ahhh, the past." "I thought this movie would be a stinker. It reminded me of Blade Runner and contrary to most people, I didn't like that movie too much. So I was skeptical about seeing this. However, that skepticism didn't last long. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie. This movie is about a young cop who was brutally murdered. He is resurrected as part human, part robot. In his new life, he goes after the people who murdered him. The acting is very good. I enjoyed the performances by Peter Weller, Ronny Cox, and Miguel Ferrier. Overall, this is an enjoyable action/sci-fi movie. This movie is very violent though. I rate this film 8/10."

"*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "When I was a kid, the word \"Robocop\" would bring into mind a silly robot policeman who talked funny (thanks Robocop 3). When I grew older,I saw the first \"Robocop\" and all I could say that I was blown away just like Peter Weller's Hand. I never thought that a movie about a very cartoonish-looking character could be so vicious and brutal. Peter Weller's mutilation was disturbing and his revenge as Robocop provide equally stomach-churning tableaux of undiluted nastiness. Aside from the gruesome set pieces, we are also treated to violent gun battles punctuated by bloody arterial sprays from each unlucky victim. But \"Robocop\" does't only exist to show us a human hand being blasted in graphic detail by a shotgun, it also serves as a biting, funny social commentary on how consumerism and capitalism have morally downgraded our society. This is evident in the \"infomercials\" that pop out of the film from time to time, which advertises bizarre and violent entertainment for the enjoyment of the entire family.(like that nuclear war game) what's good is that Verhoeven actually maintains the films unique mood throughout the film. The combination of violent splatter and social commentary is evident when the dumb robot, the ED-209, splatters an executive all over the place. The old man's( Dan O'Herlihy) response? \"Dick, I'm very disappointed.\" Films like this not only entertains us with violent action, it also takes its time to make us laugh as society spirals downward. ROBOCOP FOR TOP 250!!!" "Yes, the guy who did this movie would later make Starship Troopers, here though I think is a more realistic take on a future society. A rather violent society, a place where the average cop just is not enough so they try to make a super cop. First, they try a totally robotic one with very deadly yet somehow darkly comic results. Since this one fails another person gets to try it his way and they make this robotic cop using the remains of an officer who is simply gunned down in a most brutal and unpleasant way. So the officer goes out on his beat and takes out criminals very effectively albeit a bit emotionless. His former partner though jogs his memory and all hell breaks loose at a factory where we have a very cool fight that even involves a dude getting toxic waste on himself. Then you have a conclusion that while not as great as the factory fight is still rather cool and a bit funny as well. So there you have it, Peter Weller does a rather good job as Robocop, Nancy Allen is okay too, but nothing special. Good villains too, but I can not really say if I remember seeing them in other movies other than Ronny Cox as if has been awhile since I have seen this movie. Though as a kid I thought this movie was the bomb as I saw it at the theater. Did not care for the fake commercials in it though." "Usually I don't like thin, action movies. However, RoboCop is far from thin. The plot here is actually quite complex. In the near future, Detroit is a city packed with crime, and the normal police aren't enough to stop it. The police force is bought out by a big corporation, Omni Consumer Products (O.C.P.), and they have new plans for the police force to stop the crime. Their answer? RoboCop. The performances here were excellent. Peter Weller was entertaining as Officer Murphy (RoboCop). Nancy Allen was good as Officer Lewis, Murphy's partner. Dan O'Herlihy was perfect as The Old Man, the owner of OCP. Ronny Cox was good as Dick Jones, the #2 person of OCP. Miguel Ferrer was great as Bob Morton, the OCP executive who creates RoboCop. And Kurtwood Smith was great as Clarence Boddicker, the unofficial \"crime boss' of Old Detroit. Besides great acting, there are great effects, costumes and props. Making this movie much MUCH more than a thin, no-plot action movie. RoboCop is very entertaining and should appeal to nearly all audiences. 9/10." "RoboCop was one of the first R rated movies I ever saw as a child. Back when they had this allure of being forbidden and dangerous. I'll freely admit I was much too young to catch its satire and a lot of the plot points flew right over my head. I was more affected (and to a degree traumatized) by its graphic violence and the horrible circumstances of Murphy's fate. But the film stuck with me. It was such a compelling character surrounded by equally interesting supporting characters. The villain gave me nightmares and I was flat out terrified of him. It was also one of the first movies with morally ambiguous individuals I'd ever seen. Until then the good guys were good and the bad guys were bad. But it wasn't that simple in RoboCop. And even at that young age that resonated with me. As I got older I began to appreciate the film on entirely other levels. And now, at 25 I love it even more. What we have here is something that could easily have turned into straight to video silliness. A mediocre script and laughable concept made into something revolutionary by great film-making. The lower points on Paul Verhoeven's resume can be forgiven because of gems like this. So many of the sequences in this film are just brilliantly shot and conceived (Murphy's death, the slow introduction to RoboCop, the Rock Shop bust, and the entire third act). He took subpar material and managed to shape it into so much more. But Verhoeven doesn't deserve all the credit. Peter Weller's performance is suitabaly repressed but somehow still so emotive. Not an easy task when all the audience sees is the lower half of your face. Kurtwood Smith takes corny and clichéd dialogue and makes it haunting and believable. The film has a down and dirty tone that no subsequent versions of the franchise have ever matched. There's beauty in its brutality and a cohesiveness sorely missing in the sequels. It feels epic and intimate at the same time. It's imaginative and awe inspiring. There were so many places to go with this character and so many possibilities. It's a shame the films and TV series that followed wasted all of them. Now the franchise inspires laughs and is all but dead. It's too bad because it's easy to forget how powerful and truly rock solid this first entry is." "In the near future of Detroit City. The major corporation \"OCP\" wants to built an Cyborg by making the perfect futuristic Police Officer. One day, Police Officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is killed on the line of duty by an ruthless gang of murdering/thieves (Lead by Kurtwood Smith). The \"OCP\" finds the perfect candidate by using several body parts of Murphy of their division. When \"OCP\" actually succeed by creating the perfect law enforcer and the cyborg is been called Robocop. Robocop becomes very successful with the public and the media, they think Robocop is the Ultimate Defender of Justice. Until the mind of Murphy has resurrected on Robocop and now taking personal revenge on the thugs, who murdered him. Directed by Paul Verhoeven (Black Book, Basic Instinct, Showgirls) made an thrilling, extremely well made violent film with plenty of action, humour, emotions and soul. Weller gives an solid believable performance as Murphy/Robocop in this instant classic film. The script is very clever and original as well. This film also stars Nancy Allen, Dan O'Herlihy, Miguel Ferrer, Ray Wise and Paul McCrane. Verhoeven's movie is an stylized cop-thriller.

"*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "i liked this movie quite a bit.it's very well paced,the acting is pretty good and it is ultra violent.it's basically about a part human,part cyborg cop who cleans up the streets of the city.there are some glitches along the way,of course.i think the movie,at its heart is a social satire.it's very relevant,even more so today.there are touches of irony and humour through out.Paul Verhoeven directed it and it's his first Americna movie.Verhoeven doesn't shy away from violence and if that sort of thing bothers you,you'll want to skip this movie.there is another,maybe more futuristic robotic cop,which i really like the look of.(possible minor spoiler ahead)there are two showdowns between RoboCop and this other futuristic,more advanced robot,both of which i found exciting and well done.for,me RoboCop is an 8/10" "I can't say that Paul Verhoeven is one of my favorite directors, but I have to admit that he definitely has a sense of humour. Robocop is a type of title that would make it sound like the dumbest thing on the planet or at the very least \"Diet Terminator\". Luckily the film is neither of these things. Robocop combines a rather standard action film with an interesting political message. A serious film is the best kind of satire and the various elements that make up the gritty tale of Robocop are what make it rather distinct in its B-film class. It is a violent film with a lot of heart. The 80s cheese-factor is noticeable in the film but luckily most of the film was shot very impressively and Robo himself only has a few moments of cheesy method-twitching. I was rather blown away by the quality of the stop-motion animation. In all Robocop is rather unusual film. It does not quite rise to the level of stand-out hits in the genre but is a notable film in its own right and definitely an enjoyable cinematic experience." "Robocop was a definite commercial success both in the United States and overseas. It has since become a classic example of the futurist genre alongside such great films as The Road Warrior, Blade Runner, and the much overlooked Charleton Heston classic Soylent Green. The thematic intertextuality of these films is clear, as they all deal in one way or another with issues such as overpopulation, the deterioration of the human lifestyle, consumerism and the corporation as the root of all evil. Robocop has earned it's place in popular culture as a prime example of its genre and has been nominated for Academy Awards in film editing and sound. Director Paul Verhoeven won the Saturn award in 1988 for his work on Robocop, and the film went on to receive more than a dozen awards and nominations including BAFTA and the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films. Robocop has become a classic meditation on the detritus of modernity, and reminds us not to lose our humanity in the rat race of the post industrial world." "This movie is both a reason not to lose hope in Hollywood, and at the same time painfully reminds us how tame, boring and stupid most of the action genre has become. Paul Verhoeven never used more efficiently the unparalleled resources Hollywood has to offer. With a decent - but not overblown - budget, he manages to show a spectacular display of action and great special effects that you can still watch today without laughing, unlike many other 80's movies. The story (a cop working in a corruption-ridden society is brutally murdered and turned into a robotic law enforcer) is fairly simple, and in other hands could've ended like many other childish action movies. But the satiric tone and the full-frontal violence not only validates the humor, but helps the audience to understand the social critic without hammering it down. It's a moral tale, but certainly not a lecture. The unbelievable boldness of the tone and the nifty execution turns this sci-fi/political pamphlet into a \"Clockwork Orange\"-like phenomenon. It's not aimed at kids, but if the brutality wasn't so over-the-top it should be shown to the youngest moviegoers, as the REAL action movie. No over-use of CGI. No annoying sidekick. No stupid humor or \"satisfactory\" ending. No compromise. The 21st century truly NEEDS a movie like this. Not a remake, or a reboot, or whatever fancy name the studios come up with. Just a new kind of no-nonsense, clever, ambitious big budget movies that doesn't insult the audience's intelligence for a change. To settle the score with subsequent shallow Hollywood flicks whose makers brag about carrying on RoboCop's legacy while reaching for the lowest common denominator (\"Iron Man\", anyone?). To set a new standard in blockbusters, an alternative to silly, brainwashing and heartless \"entertainment\". The sooner's the better." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Saw this in the cinema and have seen it numerous of times since. Fantastic from second one with an incredible story and super cast. The story of how technology has created the ultimate Super Cop. Poor Alex Murphy is gunned down by scumbag criminals and is recreated into RoboCop. The city is overrun by criminals and the hope is that RoboCop can bring some order to chaos. Peter Weller puts on a fine performance as RoboCop as his memories creep back of who he is and of who 'killed' him. Action is brilliant and eye pleasing as much as is the bloodshed!! Kurtwood Smith puts on an excellent show as Clarence Bodicker, the main bad guy too. The whole story of vengeance and corruption is so well versed in this movie and will certainly please all! Watch the director's cut for a real treat if you've seen this! Such a shame about the multitude of follow ups though........"

"oh my god what a movie!!! i was only 8 when this hit the cinemas in the UK so my 1st viewing was 9 when it was on VHS everyone at school was raving on about it and one day my dad came in drunk with a copy from the video rental store. i was scared at 1st given its 18 rating but when i seen it all the way through i was soon bouncing round the house thinking i was robocop shouting \"your move creep\" to any of my other toys that would listen. now as an adult watching it i can appreciate everything all over again including storyline,characters,plot and direction even to this day i still get that nostalgic 80's feel of the movie. granted it looks slightly outdated now and you can clearly tell its just a man in a suit but even to this day and for anyone who has not yet seen it there is something fascinating about the robocop character from the way he looks and moves to the great acting from peter weller robocop is like your dark side of a superhero for the more adult audience. if you love your 80's sci-fi movies then this is one of the greatest up the with the likes of 'the terminator' i have had many favourite movies I've loved over the years since robocop but this movie will always have a special place in my heart. a must and i mean MUST own DVD!!!" "When Alex J. Murphy (Peter Weller) is killed in the line of duty, OCP scientists put his brain into the ultimate law enforcement battle droid however when he starts remembering who he was, he sets out to avenge his brutal execution and along the way much blood spills. What makes Robocop such a classic is because the movie is more than just a good action flick. It has genuine ideas, black humor, excellent satire and an unpredictability that shows up most in the genre. Also there is a depth to the sequences where Peter Weller wonders what he's become and there is a really powerful scene where Weller walks into his house he owned when he was human, and his memories come flooding back. It's a mix of drama, humor and action that works to extreme satisfaction and although Robocop sometimes goes to excess, there is no denying that it is one of the best science fiction movies of the 80s. But what really makes this brilliant is mainly the acting and the characters, all of the characters are sketched out three dimensionally and the film gets it's moments of heart out of Weller's excellent performance. * * * * out of 4-(Excellent, a must see!)" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This is one of those movies you see again and again. Peter Weller portrays an police officer who gets shot a million times and dies. but then company officials decide to make a \"Robocop\" out of him. The quotes in this movie are endless and memorable! like: \"Rape Victim: Oh God, I was so scared! Thank you! RoboCop: Madame, you have suffered an emotional shock. I will notify a rape crisis center.\" In many ways this is a fun movie to watch, and there's plenty of action to go around to. So if you and your friends want some thrills and some laughs, i highly recommend \"Robocop\". 20 years after its release it's still as entertaining and memorable as it was then!" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Big words, perhaps, but in this case they are undoubtedly true. To compare RoboCop to films such as Casablanca, The Godfather or Rain Man would be foolish, but it easily ranks with these classics, even though it of course a very different film. RoboCop is probably looked upon as simply another sci-fi action film. A very good one, perhaps, but no more than that. To those who don't know a lot about films it is indeed probably a rather silly film about a man in a tin can shooting people. Indeed, on the surface, it pretty much is. Looking deeper the film it is clearly something of a revenge film, about a cop who is brutally murdered and comes back to avenge his death. But at the heart of the film, RoboCop is a story about the human spirit and how, despite however many mechanical additions are made to a person, they are still the same man underneath. Murphy is a regular cop, with a wife who he loves dearly and a son who he loves and tries to make happy, even if it is just through the simplest of things like imitating his son's favourite television character. He is of course though brutally murdered by a gang of thieves, and when he returns months later, is a cyborg law enforcer(a product of corporate America, in essence) who, despite the best efforts of the company who 'built' him (OCP), underneath all of the fancy new equipment he is still the same cop that began the film. Indeed, on his very first day on active duty (before he sets foot out of the police station, even) Murphy displays that, as he holsters his gun the same way as he had been practicing for his son. Slowly RoboCop, still only suspecting his true origins, pieces together his life as Murphy, and in the final act of the film, eventually comes to the inevitable conclusion that he was Murphy, and indeed still is Murphy. Thus, RoboCop is not simply a ghost in a machine, he is in fact a human being; the very same human being who started the film, albeit in a different body. As for RoboCop ranking up with some of the greatest films ever made, the answer is relatively simple. Now that we have discovered the true meaning of the film, we then realise how well put together the whole film actually is, from opening to closing. Not a scene is wasted, as every line spoken and every bullet fired (of which there are a lot) contribute to the film in a way that most action scenes do not. Whilst the same can be said for a lot of films (from Shawshank to Road House) it cannot usually be said for an 80s Action film, especially one that is predominantly played so seriously. Indeed, there are only a few times when the film invokes moment of excess and comic book-style violence. But this is always to get the point across. The ED-209 boardroom sequence, where the robot malfunctions and utterly obliterates a member of the board (and the following line \"somebody call a paramedic!\" when the man had been shot hundreds of times), is simply showing how warped corporate America has become. The same can be said for many of the films most violent scenes, such as Emil not only melting alive from the toxic waste, but then being run over and exploding like a water balloon, and even Murphy's own death at the hands of Clearance's gang, where Verhoeven just pushes the scene into ludicrous proportions when Murphy's entire right arm is blown off; although it is a scene of horror, when the arm goes one is almost forced to laugh as it is simply so silly. The violence isn't there to be 'cool,' it is a metaphor for the ridiculousness of many aspects of American society. And unlike most robot/cyborg films, the central character is not an unstoppable, cool and morally correct individual. RoboCop is a flawed human being, encased in a metal shell, trying to come to terms with his new existence (never has an actor invoked such a tearful performance using just his jawline), and whose actions are often morally ambiguous; for example, every time he stops a crime he does a lot more damage than the criminal was doing (destroying the convenience store, blowing up the petrol station etc.). The political and social satire, the brutal graphic violence, the tragedy of the main character, the special effects (which at the time were groundbreaking, and really haven't dated too badly at all), the brilliant main theme and the message of the film all place it among the very best that cinema has produced. Paul Verhoeven is a master director, and RoboCop is undoubtedly his (American?) masterpiece. To conclude, then, RoboCop is an action film with a heart, so much so that it is in no way shameful to cry at the last exchange of the film: \"Nice shooting, son. What's your name?\" \"Murphy.\"" "Being a cop can be dangerous, being a cop in the future can be twice as dangerous. Peter Weller does an spectacular job as \"Robocop\". Weller is Alex Murphy, a very dedicated cop who get transfered to the most heated precinct of Detroit. And on the first day of his job, he gets gunned down brutally by Boddicker(Kurtwood Smith) and his henchmen. His partner Officer Annie Lewis(Nacy Allen) rushes him to a hospital. There he becomes a perfect candidate for a cybernetic design fit for him: \"Robocop\". This piece of work may just give Steve Austin a run for his money. 10 times more durable, very accurate, and somewhat struggle to find out more secrets about the company who made him. I liked the parts where the would-be thief is taken care of swiftly, and the other part where he shot the would-be sex offender in the groin through her skirt! Apparently, she didn't care about her skirt, she was just grateful that she was rescued. Then, I liked the scene where he told one of the men who shot him to \"DROP IT!\" Those ED-209 droids were fun to watch, they were very flawed, because of the malfunctioning. It took the heavy gun to put it out of commission. Even battle-damaged, Robocop lived up to its name. Avery good sci-fi movie. And Ford got a lot of credit with their cars. I enjoyed this movie very much! 4 out of 5 stars!" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "The setting is futuristic Detroit. OCP (Omni Consumer Products) is a giant conglomerate company who owns almost everything, including Detroit's police department, which they run as a private enterprise operation. However the future is anything but perfect, in fact it's one big violent nightmare. \"Old Detroit\" as it's now called is overrun by criminal scum of all kinds & numerous officers are being murdered on the streets daily by the could hearted criminals which are quickly taking over the streets. In an attempt to curb crime & save money from hiring new officers & regain control of the streets. They seek a cheaper much more efficient way of dealing with crime, what else but a heavily armed robot? it can withstand a lot of punishment, doesn't have to be paid, will be on call 24/7 & cannot be killed! OCP vice-president Rich Jones (RONNY COX) & his team have been working on what they think is the answer: ED 209, a massive & very dangerous robot & what they think will be a perfect prototype & cheap & sufficient answer OCP is looking for. But when his creation malfunctions & violently kills a co-worker, his hard work & plans are trashed, by the head of OCP (DAN O' HERLIHY). Robert Morton a young yuppie like OCP employee, then presents his idea to the owner for creating a smaller, easier to control, but much more efficient, cyborg model, if only they could find the perfect specimenthis all comes to them, in the form of family man & fellow police officer ALEX MURPHY (PETER WELLER) who has re-located with his family from Metro South to a Precinct in Metro West Detroit. On his first day, Alex & his partner OFFICER ANN LEWIS (NANCY ALLEN) chase down an truck involved in an armed robbery at a bank, that just happens to be driven by a group of sadistic drug dealers. Tracing them to an abandon factory, Alex & Ann radio in for back-up but are told it cannot be sent, due to most of the units being tied up at the moment. They decide instead to head in themselves to apprehend the criminals, which proves to be a very big mistake, when Alex is brutally murdered by the drug dealers led by the cold hearted KURTWOOD SMITH. Morton immediately claims full ownership of Murphy's body, wiping Murphy's mind clean & then rebuilds his body with Armour & a computer in his head full of data & police commands & laws. Released to the public as \"RoboCop\" a well trained, well armed, half man, half machine, Murphy quickly rids the streets of the criminal scum who run it, while becoming a media sensation in the process. However he soon starts having flashbacks to his past & as a result, regains his full memory. Robocop then sets out to dispatch the violent felons who did him in. ROBOCOP has to be without a shadow of a doubt one of the best sci-fi action films ever made! it was so influential that it would spawn a whole catering of cyborg movies well into the 90's. The film is a refreshing (albeit violent) salty poke in the eye of the Regan-era sense ability prevalent at the time of it's release. It's loaded to the eyeballs with pitch black, droll humour featuring inane TV commercials (most of which promotes OCP products, video & board games). The film is insanely violent, as we see people thrown through plate glass windows, attempted rapes, a hand is blown off, bodies are literally shot almost to pieces with bullets, a body meltdown after a criminal has been dosed in toxic waste, various stabbings etc. Murphy's death in particular is one of the most violent ever committed to celluloid. The acting really works here, PETER WELLER was a good choice to play Robocop, while NANCY ALLEN stands out as Murphy's tough, but caring partner. KURTWOOD SMITH plays his villainous drug lord character to a hilt, while RONNY COX does well as the sadistic vice president of OCP, who attempts to destroy Robocop & re-install his own ED 209 robots. The direction by PAUL VERHOEVEN is perfection, as he is able to balance the action, science fiction & humour at a perfect balance & manages to capture all of the action set pieces at all the right angles. The only downside is, is that while the film is highly entertaining & it's plot really engaging & it's action set pieces tremendous, the film skimps on many other factors that I felt could have made the film that much better. For example we learn about a half hour in, that Murphy is a family man, with a loving wife & son & yet we never see Murphy with his family, we just catch glimpses of his past with them through a TV monitor, that Robocop has inside his memory bank. This plot point is incredibly watered down, so much so that it could so easily have been lifted from the film & we could still have a movie! A particular memorable (albeit sad sequence) sees Alex re-visitng his old home that he & his family moved into a few months prior when he re-located to this precinct, only to find the house empty & learning that his wife & kids have moved on. In fact, Murphy never meets his family again, who assume he's really dead & I felt this robbed the film of the emotional impact it could have had. All in all, ROBOCOP is highly recommended for all action fans, who want to see a nonstop in you're face action movie, you won't be disappointed! A box office smash that was quickly followed by a live action TV series in 1994, two animated children's series & a four part made for TV mini series called ROBOCOP: PRIME DIRECTIVES & a remake in 2014. Followed by two sequels, starting with ROBOCOP 2. **** stars" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "I was about 8 years old when I first saw RoboCop. Of course at that age I was much too young to be watching such a violent, grim movie but I loved every second of it. The breathless action, the dizzying pace and the surprising humour. As I got older, I began to realise the humour I'd picked up on was actually a very sly, cutting level of satire. RoboCop is not merely senseless violence (unlike some of director Paul Verhoeven's subsequent outings). It's a very carefully balanced blend of action with an astutely observed satirical view of the future that makes RoboCop a superior film of the genre. RoboCop is not too specific about how far into the future its set, but I assume the writers have placed it fairly close to our own time so its not too unrecognisable, but also distant enough with subtle changes in society to make it the near future. RoboCop is clever the way it draws the audience into this frighteningly realistic portrayal of our future. Instead of monologues or captions explaining what has happened to the world, the film quite ingeniously begins with a three minute news show headlining violent events underscored with a sharp wit, like neutron bombs used as a peace platform. Not to mention the hilarious adverts included that eat up the showtime, promoting everything from nuclear war boardgames for families to overpriced cars (6000 SUX!) with the slogan \"Bigger is Better. An American Tradition.\" The action is centred around the city of Old Detroit. Crime is rampant. Urban chaos is through the roof. And ever since OmniConsumer Products (OCP) took control of the police department, cop mortality rates have skyrocketed. Since OCP is nothing more than a faceless figurehead of heartless capitalism, they couldn't care less what happens to police precincts. So to remedy the crime in Old Detroit, Senior Vice President Dick Jones (Ronny Cox) has designed what he calls the future of law enforcement, ED 209. ED 209 is a giant cumbersome robot that is supposed to crack down on crime. But in one inspired scene, it is hilariously inept in everything it does. It makes mincemeat out of an executive after it unwaveringly follows its programming. And another exec comes up with a solution. Create a cyborg. Something that is programmed with police procedures, but tempered with the actual experience of being a cop. OCP get their chance when Officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) becomes a living shooting gallery at the hands of gangland hood Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith) and his cronies. OCP take what's left of Murphy, erase his memories, and turn him into RoboCop, a titanium armoured juggernaut, programmed with the desire to eliminate all crime. But when Murphy's human memories begin to surface, he tracks down Boddicker and his gang to get revenge. Including Jones, who's in league with Boddicker. If you look carefully behind all the bloodsoaked violence and shocking gore, you will find a very intelligent action film at the heart of RoboCop. It makes some very astute observations at the directions our society is headed. The idea that the police may strike because of the harsh conditions they're forced to endure is very frightening. As well as the notion that the youth of the future are being brainwashed by televised violence doesn't bode well either. Paul Verhoeven manages to get the focus just right in this film. He creates an extremely violent action film, but infuses it with a witty, satiric side that really enhances the viewing experience. I love the throwaway gags such as the urinals in the executive washrooms that have current interest rates above them. Verhoeven has never really managed to accomplish the same balance with his other SF films like Total Recall or Hollow Man. They have none of the intelligence of RoboCop. RoboCop's greatest asset was the inspired casting of Peter Weller. RoboCop is someone who has more than a passing resemblance to Judge Dredd. The top of his face is hidden, and we only see his jaw, and Weller manages to communicate an astonishing level of emotion. Consider the scene when he returns to his empty house after his wife and son have left. Memories of his previous life emerging briefly, and fading just as quickly. It demonstrates that Paul Verhoeven can infuse a tangible feeling of poignance when the need arises. Weller also does a superb job as RoboCop. With his monotone voice, stilted body language and lantern jaw, he gives a very realistic performance of a cyborg. On a par with Arnie's Terminator, Weller exudes authority, but also real sympathy for his situation. Which is not hard after we witness what happens to Murphy. A shockingly brutal demonstration of the callous disregard for life Boddicker's thugs have. Verhoeven keeps the action going but knows when to dial it down too. Something that doesn't always come easily to him. And its very gratifying watching Murphy whittle down the thugs who destroyed his life, eventually settling the score with Boddicker and Jones. The ending is bittersweet though. Murphy has reclaimed the humanity he was robbed of, but he can never go back to the way he was. And so it should be. There are no easy solutions here. Otherwise it would be a terrible ending to an exceptional action film. The sequels wavered in quality, but the original still holds the candle for being the most accomplished. An intelligent, witty, scathing action bonanza that still holds resonance today. Hard to believe it came from the director of Showgirls!" "I first saw this movie when I was three or four and was scared as hell! This movie is now quite possibly my favorite ever. There's a great blend of tragedy, deep storytelling, interesting shots, intense effects and insane action to satisfy anyone. There's (quite) a bit of blood so if you get sick easily avoid it. Everyone else must witness the awesome power of this sublime production. The effects are quite advanced. The stop motion ED-209 is mind-blowing. The Robocop suit is better than any CGI crap. I'll take props over green screen any day. This movie delivers intense action but also has a great, touching story about the loss of humanity. Peter Weller delivered a great performance, however uncomfortable he may have been. This movie has spawned two sequels, almost 100 comic books, toys and other random product (Robo Stationary), of which I have an interesting collection. Robocop is beyond cult status and I consider it to be an A movie, not a B movie. There are no real flaws in this movie but the action and the plot do slow down towards the end. However, the action does pick up. Robocop two is good, but not as amazing as the original. The end of the movie makes me smile every time I see it. This is truly a can't miss film for fans of sci-fi, action, satire or anyone looking for a cool movie." "It is Steven Spielberg Himself who encouraged Paul to come to the States to work on film making in and for Hollywood. Paul was not very interested at the beginning. When He first saw the script of Robocop, he thought it was rubbish. Sounds like a low budget B movie, maybe. But his wife didn't agree with this first impression and encouraged him to work on it. And the Dutch man did so. And provided one the best Action movie ever done. And trust me, I watched Lots of them! \"Robocop\" is very closed to perfection. Great casting, to begin with. From Murphy himself to Clarence Bodicker, one of the worst Villain ever portrayed. And everything is great in this movie. The Scenario is clever and realistic. The Editing also is terrific. There are no \"blank\" scenes whatsoever. It is action, action and action. Non stop with clever links. The music, the soundtrack, is also very efficient. This movie wont be as good if Paul didn't direct it. Paul got the power from Hollywood and he managed it very well!I love you Paul !" "A Great and totally originial Sci-Fi/Action treat! A movie of sheer excellence, and past all the blistering torcherous violence, there is a fantastic story in which some failed to see. Peter Weller gave a terrific zing to the character and I'm really wishing he stayed with the franchise, coulda provided some shred of hope for the catastrosphe which many fans of this film now know as Robocop 3. Nancy Allen was equally as breathtaking alongside the lead man, her care for Weller was portrayed so sincerely, it was nice to give Robocop a female opposite him, I felt more of stronger presence emotionally with Weller and Allen than I would with Glover and Gibson in Lethal Weapon for example. The villains were outstanding, I remember how much I hated Kurtwood Smith when I first saw this movie, meaning just how great of a villain he was, so empty, sadistic and menacing, a perfect portrayal. Ronny Cox did it for me as well. Paul Verhoeven's craftsmanship is masterful, it's also a shame he left the franchise I wished he had stayed for at least Robocop 2, he really gave this movie a feel that it's sequel lacked, that superior punch in the face of emotion combined with the intense violence, brilliance, one of my all time favourite movies and one of the first films that attracted me to cinema" "Add another review" "Find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your Watchlist and rate your favorite movies and TV shows on your phone or tablet!")("Movies, TV & Showtimes" "Celebs, Events & Photos" "News & Community" "Watchlist" "" "Find industry contacts & talent representation" "Manage your photos, credits, & more" "Showcase yourself on IMDb & Amazon" "Sign in with Facebook Other Sign in options" "Own the rights?" "I don't know why, but somehow this movie got to me more than any Sci Fi Action. Maybe its the cool story, maybe its the perfect storytelling, maybe its the futuristic drama we can find in some scattered places or maybe its the perfect acting from all the actors. Director Paul Verhoeven has directed the movie, and he is one of my personal all time favorite directors (alongside John Carpenter). He made more Sci Fi masterpieces, Total Recall and Starship Troopers, but this still is his greatest moment. Every single detail seems to be thought out completely and the direction is made with love. On his front, there are no negative parts. The acting is great, despite absence of those superstars like Tom Cruise and Mel Gibson. The movie proves that actors who are pretty unknown can make great performances. Peter Weller rocks the sh*t out of many actors with his spotless performance and so does almost every other actor. Maybe I haven't told you enough about the movie itself, but if you just start to look at it, you'll get hooked and after the movie you'll love it. Too bad that the two sequels qualify themselves to the bottom 100." "Major spoilers ahead. Dutch director Paul Verhoeven's \"Robocop\" is a masterful tale of a cybernetic human who has lost his humanity to the corporation that owns him, and his journey not only to exact vengeance on his murderers, but to regain his pre-mortem identity. This dystopian science fiction movie is quite unique because its vision of dystopia incorporates the perils of laissez-faire capitalism and the bloated conglomorates which have taken over peoples' lives. The nightmarish world of \"Robocop\" can be interpreted as an exaggeration of what Verhoeven saw as the problem with American capitalism, that private interests overcame the public good. The conglomerate portrayed in this movie cares little for public safety, even as it buys the decrepit police department of Old Detroit. Its officers, facing a losing battle against heavily-armed thugs and organized criminals, are merely nothing more than gears in the conglomerate's machine, and their lives are worth nothing unless they can turn a profit. So it is with Murphy, the protagonist, whose death proves portentous for one higher-up in the company, who uses the policeman's brain and corpse to power his pet project, \"Robocop.\" The inventor's rival also manufactures a tank-like war machine, intended for law enforcement, and sees Robocop as a threat. The latter company man, the evil Dick Jones, sees the threat as competition for his robot tank which, as he explains in the movie, even if it is a failure (at the expense of one company man's life), is valuable for its parts. Verhoeven's cynicism is extreme for his movie's vision of dystopia, as corporate capitalism colludes with organized crime for their own mutual interests rather than for the public good. The deceased Murphy has indeed lost his humanity, not only by becoming a robot, but also by being considered the corporation's property; he is not an individual, but a patented product. Robocop's assertion of individuality by exacting vengeance on his killers, and later against the corporation that sponsored them, is Verhoeven's allegoric demonstration of the individuals will to assert himself against those who see him as a mere cog in a machine, in this case a thing to be owned and to make profit for a corrupt capitalist oligarchy. Late-twentieth century news media---and the 1980s concerns of the Cold War, Latin American proxy wars, and the bourgeois culture of greed and consumption---are viciously and hilariously lampooned in a series of faux news broadcasts. It was wonderful of Verhoeven to include some delicious irony in his satire by casting Mary Hart, the bubbly blond co-host of \"Entertainment Tonight\" as a news anchor---one might argue that Hart, unknowingly or not, is caricaturing and parodying real life identity as a purveyor of superficial entertainment reporting. Those who sincerely believe in the capitalist ethos may be off-put by Verhoeven's extreme cynicism with the get-rich-quick way of life but it does bring a very interesting spin to the genre of science fiction which very few directors have been able to portray. The closest film which depicts this sort of dystopia is \"Blade Runner,\" also about consumer products asserting their individuality, but without the satiric bite of Verhoeven's masterpiece. Frank Weller is excellent as Robocop. The other actors all lend credibility to this marvelous film. It is filled with enough action and special effects to please any lover of action or science fiction movies. On important caveat is that this is an extremely violent movie. Verhoeven loves to be gruesome, and he dresses his violent flick to the nines. Do not let very small children watch this film. Other than that, I highly recommend this excellent science fiction classic." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Verhoeven has said that this movie,for him, is about the creation of an American Jesus. Being an American Jesus, therefore, Robocop shoots the bad guys to bring them to salvation. I must say, for years before I listened to Verhoeven's commentary for the film, I never understood this movie in that particular way. My understanding had been much more straightforward: a story about a man brought back from the dead to be used as a crime fighting machine, and, potentially, as a weapon of oppression by the power elites of OCP. That's Directive Four. It's also a horror movie about the forcible intrusion into the body of sharp, mechanical, hard edged things, against one's will. A horror story of a human identity trapped in an ugly mechanical shell. And just why is it that they keep Murphy's face? That always struck me as perverse, more of a designer's fancy than practical. I find the story, for all of its horror and cynical humor, to be uplifting: Murphy finds a way to exist in his new state of being, and regains an essential kind of humanity. He's still bound by his directives (that sinister Directive Four humming ominously away in his consciousness) but it's better than not knowing why he does what he does. Critics have been very unkind to the first sequel, Robocop 2. I find Robocop 2 to be just as brilliant, if not as tight and smooth as Verhoeven's original. Robocop 3 lost the thread for me, though it has one or two moments. Also of interest is Takashi Miike's own remix of Robocop, Full Metal Yakuza." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "What you normally expect from a 80s action film is big muscles, horrendous puns and oodles of homoeroticism. Instead RoboCop is an excellent satire with plenty of violence on the side. A pretty good combination, if I don't say so myself What's most worrying about watching RoboCop almost twenty years since it was released is how acutely the media portrayed in the film correlates with the media today. Hell, Media Break might as well just be called Fox News! Just take the glib, insincere way that Casey Wong says 'Get well, Frank.' It's just the same as some mindless cheerleader of a reporter whooping 'Marines kick ass!' Everything is reduced to inane soundbites. And then there's Corporate America. The film was made during the 'greed is good' era, but things haven't changed. It's still a macho, testosterone packed world where profits and personal advancement come first. After all, what matters more, that someone gets killed or that the 'glitch' that got the person killed costs the company $50m in interest payments? I think you know the answer. But there's also the references to Vietnam ('urban pacification' and McNamara), the state of American manufacturing (6000 SUX), privatisation, the American style of policing (reading someone their rights as you thrown them through a window) and religion (Verhoeven suggests that RoboCop is like Jesus. He gets crucified, he dies and he gets resurrected. And quite appropriately for an American Jesus, he kills a lot of people). So there's a lot there if you want to look for it However, just as an action spectacle the film more than delivers. The action sequences are universally superb. The best one of all is probably the drug factory shoot-out. The music is great, the shots are superbly picked and there's none of that schizophrenic editing that you get in modern action films. Here you can actually see what's happening! Another great piece of action is the gas station explosion. Ah, the age without CGI But the action would be empty if you didn't care about the hero. Thankfully, though, you doeven when he's a tin can! I mean, Murphy must have one of the most grisly deaths on celluloid. He's blown to bits, taunted ('Does it hurt?') and then ruthlessly executed. If you didn't care for him before, you do afterwards. And when he becomes RoboCop, he still manages to elicit more sympathy than most action heroes. Most of this is probably because he's so obviously flawed. Sure he's a ruthless killing machine but he's been stripped of his identity, his family and even his body ('lose the arm'). So when he revisits his house and sees what he lost and when like Frankenstein he sees his reflection and when he's hunted down by his own colleagues; you can't help but feel for him. I also have to admit that I can't help but feel sorry for Bob when he's killed. He's a slimy scumbag, yeah, but anyone who lives the American Dream by doing cocaine with bimbos can't be all bad. And I also have say that his death scene has one of the best lines in film history: 'Bitches leave.' Clarence Boddicker is such a charmer. And that's another thing that makes the film so enjoyable; it's main villain. Clarence Boddicker is exactly what you want every movie villain to be: irredeemably evil. He even kills his own men. You don't get much better than that Perhaps the only bad thing about RoboCop is ED-209. But even that's good. I'll never tire of him mowing down a hapless junior executive (I love the way that his colleagues push him out of the way. Gordon Gekko would be proud). In fact, RoboCop makes me pine for an era free from CGI, where fascist violence was liberal and where there was lots of good old-fashioned cussing. What's happened to mainstream cinema these days? Surely with George W.Bush in charge, political successor to Ronald Reagan as he is, the streets of Hollywood should be flowing with blood by now" "When people hear the words Robocop they often make the mistake of categorising it as yet another sci/fi action movie like the Terminator. Robocop is so much more then that. Robocop is a message, a warning about the dangers of unchecked capitalist ambition and greed. Robocop took the negative aspects of 80's cut-throat society and placed them into a futuristic environment. As such Robocop must be treated with a special reverence amongst films, this is not simply another film but rather a work of genius that allows all those who watch the film to gain an understanding of 1980's society. Robocop is indeed a philosophical masterpiece. The Suffering of Alex Murphy/Robocop is perhaps best comparable to the saviour myth of many religions including Christianity. Robocop is the great Irony whilst he personifies moral corruption it is he who will save Human Society from self destruction. As a film Robocop has it all, a great Plot backed up by Great Characters. Notably Clarence Boddicker the films villain. Hde is perhaps one of the most believable and effective screen villains of all time. The great story and characters are backed up by premium effects and high paced action. In conclusion Robocop is a life changing film that you will want to watch again and again." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Along with the Terminator this was the best scifi action film to come out during the 1980's. Though Peter Weller didn't become a household name, he does an excellent job as a murdered police officer, who is resurrected as a type of cyborg programmed to fight crime. As \"Robocop\" he dispenses justice with computer controlled pinpoint shooting accuracy. There is a lot of camp (some of it is extremely funny) which does nothing to diminish the serious drama of the film. Nancy Allen does a good job as Robocop's partner and look for the guy from That 70's Show as the evil villain." "Truly science fiction action-film at its perfection. Director Paul Verhoven (of Total Recall) paints a distopic view of future Detroit, a crime-ridden city where cops are threatening to go on strike. A large corporation that practically runs the United States Military comes out with a new machine: Robocop. This film explores the hauntingly Frankenstein-esque life of a man who has died and been transformed into a machine, or rather, super-human. The film asks questions, like what does it mean to be human? We explore the human side of robocop, as he uncovers his mysterious past. He finally gets to confront, and possibly get revenge on his killers. The film also challenges ideas of growing corporate control, as shown by the corrupt nature of OCP, a corporate entity who becomes \"above the law.\" It explores the city, a corrupt city much like an American version of of Moscow, where criminals have infiltrated the highest levels of corporate power. The distopic city has been so neglected that there is a \"New Detroit\" or \"Delta City\" where there can be hope, the rich can live in, and be away from the unsavable crime of \"old detroit.\" Although the film was made in the 80's, it is definitely still watchable today. It has much violence and gore, and is quite realistic in its special effects which are mostly animatronic. The special effects still live up to this day, and give the film a certain \"edge.\" In addition, this film challenges certain notions about corporate control of the military, and how the military-manufacturing industry, when out of control, can become dangerous to the common man and common society. It is an important watch in the strange world we are seeing develop in the United States. With such great questions & futuristic action, this film wins in both the action & science fiction category, and is easily one of the most perfect marriages of the two genres. It even has good acting, which can be rare for both of these genres. 10/10!!! (rare)" "Robocop is a film that almost didn't get made. Most people loved the concept, but hated everything else, especially the title. Some say this film is about violence and it is violent. (30 people are killed in the film according to this site)The film has to be violent to get the point across that something like Robocop is necessary, but the film is not about violence. It is more then a bloody action film. Paul Verhoven has stated that he intended this film to be more about death and resurrection then anything else. To state the idea that the sort of everyman that the character of Alex Murphy embodies could overcome death to rise again. Only to find that it is not worth the trip. Although that is felt throughout the whole film, deeper than that is what Edward Neumeier said he wanted to make the film about. What would life be like if Reaganomics had kept going? What if the yuppie population had continued to grow? What if the whole world became populated by guys like Dick Jones? (played so superbly by Ronny Cox that it is hard to tell where Cox ends and Jones begins) Alex Murphy lives in a world just like that. In a world where mans unchecked greed is finally starting to consume him. In Murphy's world there are no people, there are only consumers. Those who cannot afford to consume, become themselves consumables and are consumed. O.C.P could be any number of corporations. It is a symbol of everything that is wrong with our country. It is accumulated wealth and power, it is the big unfeeling beast that devours everything in it's path, including our friend Alex Murphy. They do not rob Murphy of his life, but of his death. They remove his dignity and strip him down to nothing more then another product, but Murphy fights back. Murphy retains something more than the memories they took from him, he retains the feelings of being human and becomes more than a machine with a human face, more then just Robocop the product. Peter Weller gives him that face and that emotion. Even behind the face shield on the helmet that Weller wears thought most of the film we can still feel his pain. We can see the hurt in his eyes, even though his eyes our covered. Alex Murphy is as Verhoven has stated a futuristic Christ. He bears the weight of our greed and the sin of or lust for wealth. We can see ourselves as the victimized Alex Murphy and we can wonder how much it would take for us to become the victimizing Dick Jones." "Many people give lame reviews for Robocop but I found it a very entertaining and in-your-face movie. The acting was, actually, pretty good and the story was deep. One thing that drew me to this movie was its raw humor. Parts of the film are so cheesy that it adds to the film's laughs and makes it more unique. Robocop himself is a great design and one of the better Sci-Fi characters in recent history. Peter Weller plays Robocop in his one truly famous role. The Musical Score is terrific and you will find your self humming it after the film's end. The film is surprisingly bloody, but in a good way. Robocop is a very violent revenge story(Rated R) and the action is first class for an 80's movie. The film is funny and creative, the bad guys are cool, and Weller's voice is a perfect human and machine fusion. I fully recommend Robocop for anyone(who doesn't mind blood)with an open mind seeking something different and fun." "A classic should be something that time does little about its grandeur. Well that happens here. There's no over-extended scenes or unnecessary dialogue, yet, the characters' construction is superb. It's a basically a 'futuristic urban story'; but still is full of ironies about corporative-controlled institutions, media and the place of individual beings in a collapsed society, things that affect us today. Michael Miner and Edward Neumeir's script is very influenced by comic-books and their particular ways of narrative, and it was a great update of a sci-fi classic theme (robotics) for a whole generation. Needless to say that the 'Primal Directives' of Robo are very similar to the 'Three Laws of Robotic' of Isaac Asimov. Paul Verhoeven is one of the greatest directors in history. RoboCop established him as a strong name in Hollywood and gained him lots of fans and even the respect of some intellectual critics always fond on destroying films like this one. The performance of the cast is subtle, but convincing. The most impressive performance is given by the whole cast not by a particular actor or actress. The bloodshed actually works fine showing how Detroit will be: lethal and unsafe. Everyone could be shredded in the streets of the post-urban Detroit. The combination of good actors, agile montage, non-static cameras, great FX and a beautiful score, made a masterpiece that should be used as an example in Cinema's Schools. If you never paid attention to the score composed by Basil Poledouris, it is a shame. It's worth owning given its elegant, grand and constant changing tunes. It fits just fine with every piece of celluloid is accompanying. All kinds of emotions can be unleashed upon hearing it: sadness, melancholy, triumph, tension; very original classical inspired music."

"This classic piece of cinematic art was helmed by dutch uber director Paul Verhoeven. It is kind of a humanoid terminator and whereas most would think that Robocop is but another robo action-flick,- most would be dead wrong. This is actually a robo actionflick with soul and the kind of themes that usually features in Verhoeven films. Instead of a hard-ass hero, we see that Robocop is actually a tragic hero who is de-humanised by the technology that saved his life. This movie is a visual feast and was way ahead of its time...having said that, it kicks serious ass even in modern day standards. And with all the versus movies doing the rounds...AvP FvJ, I half expect Robocop VsTerminator in the not too distant future." "When i first saw the 1st Robocop, i was about 6 years old and my mum had edited out all the graphically violent parts. Then i saw the original version with the violence when i was about 10. And now i have just recently purchased the special edition DVD and it has the full uncut version and oh my god it is brilliant. It has extra gore on the ED 209 sequence towards the beginning, during the mutilation of poor old Murphy and at the end where the main bad guy dies, i wont go into details about the changes, but i will say one thing, this makes it the most violent films ever to hit the DVD shelves. The film itself still contains all the original parts to it and still holds up as one of the greatest movies of the 20th century. Pure 100% adrenaline fueled mayhem combined with a dark look at a possible future to be." "At least in my mind, he takes a script that probably shouldn't have worked when you think about it. A man behind a machine in the 80's? Preposterous, but Verhoven pulls it off with a big hand from Peter Weller in the character of Murphy/Robo. If you're not a big fan of gore this probably isn't for you, Verhoven mentions in the DVD commentary of the directors cut (at least in Australia) that \"You couldn't have the resurrection without the crucifixtion\" and indeed Murphy's death is one of the most brutal scenes I've ever seen, especially in the directors cut as Murphy gets blown away by a group of thugs who knew they had him right where they want him before he's whisked away to the hospital and a seeming death, fade to black. The End. Or so you think, I kinda agree with Verhoven when he says he wanted 10-15 seconds of black before the movie. That would've worked well. Anyway we return with Murphy as Robocop, the new cyborg police machine who immediately makes an impact on the streets of Detroit, but the man behind the machine begins getting flashbacks of his life as Murphy and soon looks to take revenge. I should mention the marvellous performance by Kurtwood Smith in the role of Bodicker, one of the great villians but his role is somewhat underrated. Later on we find that Bodicker is working for OCP but when Robo tries to attack the OCP head we finally learn of \"Directive 4\" Never harm an OCP employee, which all leads to the shootout finale as Bodicker and his toughs try to terminate Robo like they did Murphy. It also features one of the more innovative ways to kill a mega-villian. The movie ends with Robo confronting OCP with the evidence of ED-209s creators collusion and again a simple solution sees him reach his end. Then just like that end of movie. Robocop probably was a few years before it's time and thus isn't as fondly remembered as some films but it's one of the best action movies out there today and fans of that genre won't be dissapointed picking this one up. Everyone was on song in this movie. From the director to the actors to the special effects guy to the guy that got everyone's coffee. Everyone put 110% into their roles and took what on paper may have been an average screenplay and made it a great one. I give it **** or 8/10" "Paul Verhoeven is a master of the futile and messy death, and nowhere does he show this off to better effect than Robocop. The titular character is almost totally covered in impenetrable armour, so when he walks into a gunfight, he cannot be hurt, but the stage can be set for an fetishtically long sequence where countless hoodlums are written off with a single shot while blazing away uselessly. The titular character's nemesis is a walking tank that orders suspects to throw away their guns or be shot, but then malfunctions and shoots them anyway. You can see from this the sort of sense of humour Paul Verhoeven has. And this isn't even the worst the movie has to offer. The goal here is the same as Starship Troopers: take a simple leftist idea like the safeguarding of individual rights or opposition to unrestricted capitalism or militarism, and dress it up with so much violence that the political dimension will be the last thing on anyone's mind. Stupid, conservative, politically-correct North America thus misses the forest for the trees. Sorry, I haven't mentioned the actual movie itself yet. It's good stuff. It shows its 80s roots strongly, but not in a bad way. Upper management having a cocaine party, for example, or \"the orbiting SDI platform misfiring and killing two former US presidents!!!\" Take that Reagan! Oh, sorry, there's the political edge again." "When I first saw Robocop I must have been about nine or ten years old: my mum was at work and my dad had sneaked out to a mates house in order to smuggle me the forbidden film. I had heard about it from a mate at school and was desperate to see it. Within the first few minutes I was enthralled. I was totally convinced I was watching an accurate portrayal of the future - it is gritty, yet authentic. The most impactual element for me - back then - was the extreme nature of the violence, and therin lies the main problem people have with the text. Yes, as a ten year old, the blood and gore is the main attraction - but Robocop is a film which rises above the box office draw reasons to create a multilayered and meaningful film. The notions of corporate power are explicitly unmdermined as inherantly corrupt in the ruthless characterisations of Dick Jones et el. The police are portrayed as humans with faults - unusual for a film whose principle charcter is a cyborg hero. And of course the lead role is a perfect vehicle for an examination of what REALLY makes us 'human'. The inclusion of the way the American media sanitises shocking events and turns them into entertainment, or even something to sell, is especially relevent today. The special armour effects by Rob Bottin are second to none, the stop motion - although dated - fits perfectly with the style of the film and does not stand out as a bad thing, and Verhoven pulls all of the punches on the witty dialogue and visceral violence. Weller shines in the role of Murphy and Clarence Boddicker is a suitably soddish villain. Many people feel that the storytlene mirrors that of Christ - its certainly about retributional violence and Murphy is an almost Christ-like figure (at least in his progression) so maybe there is some weight to the argument. Don't worry about that til the film's over though! Highlights include an arrest at an attempted rape, the toxic waste sequence and Clarence being \"deep-throated\" by Robo's spike!" "Peter Weller plays Alex Murphy, a good cop who is killed in the line of duty by a ruthless gang of villians led by the very excellent Kurtwood Smith. His dead body is then used in an experiment to create the perfect law enforcer...Robocop. All goes well until Robocop starts remembering his previous life and tries to piece together Murphys past which leads him to discover the events leading up to Murphy's death. This film could have been ruined had it not been for the excellent script, great special effects, brilliant performances by the cast including Ronny Cox as the villanous Dick Jones and not forgetting Peter Weller in the title role. Check out Nancy Allen in what some have said is the best role of her career. Dutch director Paul Verhoeven throws in some excellent satire with adverts like Nuke-Em which appears after a news report on the threat of nuclear confrontation. Not forgetting the news reports themselves which feature some excellent Irony \"Top story, the Star Wars orbitting Peace Platform misfired today, three ex president's are amongst the dead.\" Every base is covered in this film and we feel empathy for Murphy's character throughout. It's amazing to think that this film cost a third of what Robocop 2 cost to make but is far superior than the two sequels and the tv series's put together. It's just shows that money is not everything when it comes to making one of the greatest Sci-Fi Action films of all time. Imagination, character development, good story and great script is. I cannot go without mentioning the excellent stop motion scenes involving ED-209. This was before CGI but the effect is superb. If you haven't already seen this film then you must.....Must...MUST. THAT IS THE LAW......Thank you for your co-operation." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "SPOILERS Ok, 1987, Paul Verhoeven directed and released his finest work. That piece of movie history was \"Robocop\", and compared with all his other works, it is still miles ahead in terms of quality. In this movie we are introduced to Peter Weller's Alex J Murphy. Murphy is a new transfer to possibly the worst police station in Detroit. In this near future where everything looks advanced, despite still being scarily 1980s, humanity has become even more capitalistic and crime is at an alltime high. Murphy goes out on patrol with his new partner Officer Anne Lewis, played with a grating irritation by Nancy Allen, and on their first outing is butchered by a group of men lead by the evil Clarence Boddicker. Out of pure coincidence however, at this time the corporate company who runs the police force is experimenting with cyborg policemen and using Murphy's body, they create the future of Law Enforcement, the title character, the Robocop. Murphy's resurrected being goes out into the world to fight crime, stop his murderers, and rediscover himself. Let's just say straight away that this movie is great. The special effects for the time they were based are impressive and the direction by Verhoeven, who planned for this to be a modern retelling of the story of Jesus Christ, is equally amazing. It's hard to know what to say next about this movie really. All the acting, with the exception of the infuriating Allen, is relatively straight forward and nothing too special, but then it was never meant to be anything breathtaking. Ultimately this film is about the action and the question of what it is to be human. Verhoeven does attempt to answer all his philosophical questions, and what he does is impressive, ultimately though, it's as a violence filled movie which this piece will be remembered best as. Put your feet up, press play on your video or dvd player, and enjoy once the finest movies of the 1980s." "When Robocop was released in 1987 it was fresh and original. Nothing had been done exactly like this before and it shows. The actual feel of the movie was amazing and still is. At times violent and brutal but totally enjoyable at the same time. ED-209 looked and moved great (hah! who needs CGI!) and the excellent famous line \"I bet you think you're pretty smart huh? Think you can outsmart a bullet?\" (which was sampled for a couple of top hip-hop and rave tunes) is just one good example of how clever some of the quotes are in this film . The weapons are awesome and a lot of skill went in to making this movie. It could so easily have sucked like Robocop 3 but this movie was in the right hands. The eighties was such a great decade for movie making that if Robocop had been made now it would most likely suck as it would be made less violent for the mainstream viewer even if the effects would be technically superior. Miss this gem at your peril! 10/10" "RoboCop is a classic satirical science fiction film that is probably too violent (and sex saturated) for young children, and a little comicy for thinking adults--which makes it perfect for that money-spending mass we call teens. Plot Synopsis: In near-future Detroid suffering from uncontrolled crime, a young policeman gets shot trying to stop a vicious criminal--and his body is used to make a prototype android-policeman--a cop that never tires, always shoots 100% accurate and has cool shiny protective metal body, and even delivers sarcastic oneliners. But just when RoboCop becomes media sensation and a hope of ridding the city of crime, he faces evil both from the criminal element and the corruption within the Police. The movie is strong on the art direction/ production design--from RoboCop's catchy appearance, to the crime-ridden, decaying Detroid in the near-futuristic America, where Police is privatized. The most memorable sequences is when the aryan looking cop gets resurrected via becoming RoboCop--we do not see how RoboCop looks, as he walks and we see everything through his digitized POV...yet we catch a quick glance of his head in a monitor (or was it a mirror?). And by now everyone knows the film is a satire on the over-the-top media use in U.S. etc. The score is also memorable and heroic-themed. the script is pretty tight, and makes the film roll fast. With the exception of one unnecessary gory sequence in the end, in which a criminal gets acidized and becomes something like a liquid melting chunk of flesh (AND he gets hit by a van), this movie is great, though its atmosphere, if you forget the humour, can seem a little chilly and alienated--which is fitting enough for a movie about an android cop. **** Vlad" "A new Detroit cop is slayed by a band of violent criminals and is chosen to be the test subject of a new cyborg cop program called \"Robocop\". Things start out great, if the criminal body count can be described as great, but Robocop begins to regain his memory. He sets out to find out who he was, and when he does begins a hunt to get back at the criminals who slayed him. fueled by violent, pulsating action, Robocop will give action fans about all of what they look for in an action movie. the film is quite violent though, the criterion DVD is suppose to be much more violent. The ED 209 cyborg is amazing. ***/4" "Add another review" "Find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your Watchlist and rate your favorite movies and TV shows on your phone or tablet!")("Movies, TV & Showtimes" "Celebs, Events & Photos" "News & Community" "Watchlist" "" "Find industry contacts & talent representation" "Manage your photos, credits, & more" "Showcase yourself on IMDb & Amazon" "Sign in with Facebook Other Sign in options" "Own the rights?" "This movie is full of symbolism, social commentary and political satire, it is worth watching more than once. It is far more than a typical action movie and is in the same league as other classics like Highlander, The Road Warrior, Aliens and Terminator (1 & 2). I won't go into detail about the plot because if you are the type of person who enjoyed the above mentioned movies you should run, don't walk, to your nearest DVD store and buy it immediately. This film is so well written and directed that it could be used in a film school to show students how it should be done. Yes the acting is over the top, yes it is extremely violent, and yes the story seems outlandish but this is a real diamond-in-the-rough. If you don't agree then you just don't get it and never will, you're not a sci-fi fan and think this is just another action movie. If you do agree, you probably already own it and have seen it at least three times. Far superior the the sequel which is still worth watching but pales in comparison to the original. If you haven't seen it in a while, watch it again... and pay attention to the details." "A huge hit when it was released in 1987, Robocop was a great action movie and a lot smarter than its maybe given credit for. It spawned a classic arcade game and many a bedroom wall had a Robocop poster on it. Its up there with the The Terminator, Rambo, Aliens and Predator as one of the definitive action films of the 80's. Of course they soiled its reputation by two awful follow ups Robocop 2 and Robocop 3 which even original star Peter Weller passed on. As ever the original is best and is well worth buying on DVD as long you don't buy it with the other two films." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Won't worry about spoilers, cause this is not really a whodunnit. Robocop remains one of the high points of Hollywood movies in the late eighties. Who let Paul Verhoeven direct it? They probably regretted it a thousand times through production, but no-one else could have taken such a ridiculous script and made it into such an admirable movie. Watch it for the satire on modern american society and Reaganism (striking, privately owned cops?). Sure, some of the effects are a little ropey now, but Weller's stand-out physical performance is one of the best mimes ever to make it onto film. I genuinely think he deserved at least an oscar nomination for this. It's so easy to forget that he isn't really a robot. With a strong stomach necessary, this is unmissable." "Police officer is killed and rebuilt as a cyborg, goes gunning for the lowlives that killed him. Sounds like a real silly movie, doesn't it? It should and that is how the sequels and all other movies trying to imitate this movie come off. In this case, Paul Verhoeven weaves a tale that can entertain both the thinker and the action fan. I've seen a documentary where Peter Weller said that he wished the violence that was cut out to make the 'R' rating was left in. He felt it made the film more funnier. I beg to differ. With one exception, the violence was cartoonish enough that anymore would've bogged it down and the exception had to be that way. One of the best things of the movie is that Ronny Cox, Kurtwood Smith and Paul McCrane play some of moviedom's most vilest and memorable of villains. Up to that point, one usually found these three playing some of the more sensitive characters. And they pull it off! Chock full of quotable lines and seemingly throw-a-way parts that come back to mean something later, this movie is a lot of fun." "The story of a cop who is killed and brought back to life as a cyborg by a major company called OCP corporations, Robocop has a little bit of everything a person could want in a movie. It keeps you guessing, The reactions of Weller's Robocop are astounding and emotional. Most people laugh when I recommend Robocop. They think it's terrible. Most of the blame can be placed on Robocop 3, the movie which made people shudder at the sight or thought of Robocop on the Silver/small screen, and thus, Robocop fans suffer: Unable to see a decent new project or sequel by the original team. Verhoeven's direction in Robocop is some of his finest, and Peter Weller is honestly the only person suited to play the character in my opinion. He has the voice, the image, the structure both physically and in his acting. Nancy Allen shines as does Kurtwood Smith and all the supporting cast. The movie is truly one of the best films ever made, offering action, romance, suspense, drama, science fiction, horror (or gore if you want to call it that), as well as great acting, directing, and script writing. This franchise was one of the most poorly exploited, and it's a damn shame too. Highly, Highly recommended." "RoboCop is interesting on various levels for various reasons. In the first three minutes alone we are exposed to a total parody of everything we see on TV--health advertisements claiming compassion and long life, civil dispute, and global conflict all viewed from the safety of your own home (\"It's OK, he saw it on the TV\"). Everything from the obvious business corruption and defective merchandise (\"I'm sure it's only a glitch.\") to architecture and even music. Paul Verhoeven hit his highest mark as a director with this movie. It is not empty-headed like Starship Troopers and doesn't have a dependency on violence like Total Recall. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Total Recall has one violent act every seven minutes, minimum. Whereas in Total Recall, the carnage is merely titillation for action fans, RoboCop has a hidden moral to its message. The pacing is terrific, even though the DoP must have been loafing during production. RoboCop also infuses the original Frankenstein story in an amazing way. Peter Weller's character is frightening yet awesome. He is human and machine with the traits of both, but what happens when one starts becoming dominant? What happens when he starts having emotions? The rest of the cast (except Kurtwood Smith) are comic book in nature. Smith as Clarence Boddicker is the only one who manages to draw more than the typical 2D response because of his nagging charisma. He may not be talented, but here his ability is displayed in whatever glory it can attain. Overall, I found this movie more than satisfying, but weak-stomached individuals (who have no grasp of the real world) will detest its level of brutality. 4.5 out of 5 stars." "I recently bought the 3DVD Box containing all the Robocop movies. Part 2 and 3 aren't really worth mentioning after having seen the original. Robocop's a pure classic with lots of black humour, a very appealing (though tragic) \"hero\" and the real fierce and mean baddie Clarence Boddicker. Ah yes, there also is alot of gunfire, blood, gore and most above all a real message this movie delivers. Find out for yourselves (if there's still anybody that hasn't seen it). Definitely one of the best Sci-Fi/Action movies ever made. Highly Entertaining!! 10/10" "A brilliant sci-fi parody, very underrated modern action film! Paul Verhoevens directing is superlative with great acting and one of the screens best vilians Clarence Bod icker. Should be on everyones top ten sci-fi lists!!!" "One of the most emotional action film you will ever see. Peter Weller portrays police officer Alex Murphy brutually murdered in one of the most violent scenes you are ever likely to see ( especially in the director's cut), and then brought back from the dead as Robocop. The only problem being that Robocop figures out who he really is and sets out to bring his own killers to justice. What sets Robocop apart is our genuine care for the hero. We really want him to win at the end. Weller truly portrays Robocop's humanity really well and quite touchingly. Whilst Kurtwood Smith plays one of the most hated villians I can recall. A real psycho who you cannot wait to see suffer at the hands of the man he killed . Add a great score to the mix and you have a really good movie. Be warned though , despite the fact that is told in a real comic book sense, it is far from a kid's movie. As a matter of fact it is one of the most violent movies I have ever scene." "The one thing I loved about this movie was how good the story was and how original it is. Some would think that it is a Terminator rip off but its far from it. In fact there are a few movie that sole idea's from this one. The whole thing with the perfect fighting machine made from scraps of a dead human was used again in Universal Soldier. And the idea of the soldiers having their bad memories come back and make them rebel is straight from Robocop. This is one of the many original idea's from this movie. Peter Weller was good as Robocop, but I think that Kurtwood Smith stole the show as the creepy bad guy Clarence Boddiker. The rest of the cast is good, and all in all this is one hell of a movie."

"This film has a lot of great things going for it. The directing is awesome, the story is very cool and quite interesting, the acting is top-notch, the action is non-stop, the comedy is well done and well placed, the make-up effects are incredible and the special effects are phenomenal! Paul Verhoeven is a very predictable director, but does a very good job and knows how to do things right! I say he's predictable because there are certain things that he loves to have in his films (i.e. strong violence and graphic scenes), but that isn't necessarily a bad thing, you just have to expect it when seeing his films. I think \"Robocop\" is my favorite Paul Verhoeven film to date (\"Total Recall\" being a close second). Everything in this film is done so well. Robocop is very well done and has a VERY impressive look to him. Not only Robocop, but ED-209 as well, WHAT AN AWESOME DESIGN!!! Peter Weller's portrayal of Robocop is superb as well. Peter does an excellent job of making robotic movements and his voice is very true to character. The rest of the cast was quite good as well, Nancy Allen, Ronny Cox, Kurtwood Smith and Miguel Ferrer deserve some extra notice. If you are a fan of science fiction / action films, then I strongly suggest you see this film! I can watch this film over and over and not get tired of it, it's just that good. I truly hope that you enjoy the film as much as I do. Thanks for reading, -Chris" "This film could have been a simple action flick, but it avoids that completely by having an intelligent plot, interesting lead character, and incredibly on-target satire of late 1980s trends. Although very violent, I can't really say it is gratuitious since the violence always serves the plot. A must-see, I rate it at 9." "A (very violent and) well-assembled action/science fiction thriller that's set in Detroit in the future where a corporate executive takes the remains of a cop, Murphy (Peter Weller) who was brutally murdered in the line of duty and turns him into RoboCop, a cyborg cop who has the marksmanship of Dirty Harry, the heart like Serpico, and the mind of his own. In return, the rebuilt cop goes after the thugs led by Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith) who literally left him for dead, riddled with gun shots and anyone who has ties with them. The film was directed by Paul Verhoeven, who became well-known for his early efforts like \"The Fourth Man\", and unfortunately, for \"Showgirls\" in the mid-nineties. What Verhoeven gives here isn't your typical thriller, it's one that has humor, courage, and most important, heart. Perhaps, the best moment in the movie is when the Weller character tells his concerned partner, Lewis (Nancy Allen) \"You may not like what you're about to see.\" and we see why. This movie also boasts an excellent musical score composed by Basil Poledouris and the special effects/make-up done by Rob Bottin add another benefit to the film." "Robocop is a great film. I had seen it many times when I was a kid, before I even fully understood and appreciated what films actually were. I believe Robocop has a bad reputation as a serious film because it was released at the time of so many other action and sci-fi films around at the time, and it seemed to be a contest as to who could outdo each other in the over the top stakes. The film has lasted so well for so long because it is a great story with a great concept. Just like in Blade Runner, the world that the film takes place in doesn't look so different as it is now, even though it is set sometime soon in the future. And it's certainly not impossible to imagine it couldn't turn out like Old Detroit. The film has also had an infamous reputation because of the violence. The film IS incredibly violent, especially in the unrated version, and for my money is the most so I've seen in American cinema. Murphy's death scene is pretty savage and seems to last forever if it's the first time you've seen it. It's also nicely paralleled with Robocop being gunned down by Lieutenant Hedgecock later on outside the OCP building, Hedgecock and Boddicker both working for Dick Jones. And poor Kinney, who gets shot to tatters by ED-209. The film also touches on other themes such as large multi-conglomerate corporations privatising public services and news broadcasts which relay constantly shocking news daily and perfectly delivered by their smiling anchor's, which seems more and more relevant each year. The score is surprisingly memorable and fits in very nicely whenever Robo is onscreen. For me this is Paul Verhoven's best film, and he never really got as close to something as good as this again, though he almost came close a few times." "I have been mostly rating the content of the movies, and not telling much about the story. This movie is hands down one of the best sci-fi movies around. I am the proud owner of the Criterion Collection director's cut. If you like this movie, this version is THE version to own. The director's cut contains what I feel is two of the greatest maimings ever filmed. You will know them when you see them. Rated R: strong bloody violence, language, and brief nudity. Unrated: intense graphic violence and gore, language, and brief nudity." "This is one of the most violent movies ever. My parents wouldn't let me rent it (I was 8 at the time) so I first saw it at a friends house. Seeing it again, after many years, I found this movie to be very entertaining. The effects are still quite amazing and I've always had a thing for robots. Highly thought provoking and cynical. And the musical accompaniment by Basil Pouledouris is amazing. 8/10" "Robocop was not only the first of Paul's movies I viewed, but also, by far the best. His infusion of the media with character development was fresh and innovative. He has continued to incorporate it within the frame work of his films, but none so poetically. If the majority of scifi movies were half as clever as this one; THERE WOULD BE TROUBLE. Beware. This movie is not for children; even though I saw it as a child and it seemed to be targeting the youth. Nothing like packaging ultraviolence for the kiddies. Ironic, but true. Many shots were attempted at expanding the original idea with as much success as an anorexic in a chocolate factory. At least the original exploited the stupidity of our love affair for violence; what followed just exploited our own tolerance for stupidity." "I see RoboCop as one of the truly great sci-fi films--a mix of cool technology, a dystopian future, a basic hero myth, and a thought-provoking commentary. Some people see The Terminator and RoboCop as two sides of the same coin; I'd say RoboCop is the mechanical monster movie with more of a satirical bent--and that's all to the credit of the smart script. Buried beneath Verhoeven's more-is-more filmmaking philosophy are simultaneous man vs. self and man vs. machine battles--but beneath THAT is a scathing social commentary on a future filled with media overexposure and consumerist overload. What a shame the limp sequels ditched the very premise (Man or machine? Human or product? If you take a brain out of the person, can you take the person out of the brain? Or, uh, something like that) that make RoboCop such a genre standout." "I've seen this film numerous times now and still it entertains me a lot. I really must say that Paul Verhoeven knows what he does (most of the time, for I haven't seen Showgirls (yet) and I thought The Hollow Man was not too good). But this really is a good, action film, which I must say has some pretty brutal scenes and that of course is one of the two things (brutality and a lot of skin) Verhoeven is notorious of and I must say I am not offended by it, I like it. It resembles how sick our society is. But this film does not only show us where we are, but also where we might be going. I mean look at those news broadcasts in the film. The newsreaders are barely (if at all) affected by what they tell us and the way the catastrophe's (cause it all is bad news) are cut in a way that is totally mechanic, without emotions of any kind. They go even further, they just throw in commercials in the middle of the news and not just any kind, commercials of the worst kind. Enough about what I think this movie is about and on to the stuff you care about. This movie is really good. I mean OK, some of the effects are not first class, but other things are. The story is good. The acting is good (except for Kurtwood Smith, who is a GOD as the ultimate mean motherfu..er), there are a few laughs (if you are sarcastic like me and the bad guys) plus there is a lot of action and brutality. Just about everything you need in a good movie. I know I do not say this often, but this really is a film for 16+ I think. 8 out of 10" "One of the best sci-fi movies on the 80's, chock full of political commentary, social and corporate mockery of Reagan-era society, and let's not forget a tough cyborg out for justice. ROBOCOP is the story of a murdered police officer who is \"resurrected\" throrugh the miracles of technology in the near future. Given a bullet-proof exoskeleton, he busts crime and heads in futuristic Detroit. However he soon finds out that he is not just a threat to criminals, but some of his superiors as well. Peter Weller is perfect as the part man, part machine crimefighter, and both Ronny Cox and Miguel Ferrier soar as dualing corporate execs Dick Jones and Bobby Morton vying for the coveted \"teacher's pet\" position with their company's CEO. But it's Kurtwood Smith's performance as Clarence Boddicker, the slick-as-ice gang leader who really steals the show. This film has a lot in common with HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER, and a good atmosphere to accompany it. It's also violent as hell, and is notorious for having extensive cuts to a few scenes. I still crank up the TV during the cocaine factory shootout, so I can get the full feel of the movie's fanfare mixed with Sam Peckinpah-inspired quick cuts of violence. Excellent scene! This is director Paul Verhoeven's best American film, and a great all around movie. The best thing about this film is the story, concerning a cyborg who wants to stay human, and if he can't be, he feels he owes his human half the justice he deserves. 9 stars. If you can stomach the gore and violence while focusing on the story, then you'll see why this is an awesome sci-fi action flick: wicked comic bookish style mixed with biting social commentary. A must for any action fan."

"Robocop worked for me on so many levels that it is still my personal pick for the best film of all time. As a science fiction film, it works because it suspends disbelief in a brilliant manner. It accomplishes this because it only has a single fantasy element - RoboCop. As a drama, it works so well because of, among other things, a score by Basil Poledouris that I can still picture the film going along in front of me when I listen to the music by itself. As a comedy, it works brilliantly because it spares no opportunity to take a shot at the attitude that destroyed America's industrial might, the \"who cares if it works, the people will buy what we make\" attitude. As an action film, it works because the entire style of the film is \"too much\", as Paul Verhoeven states eloquently during the commentary. One of the best elements for me was RoboCop himself. All of my life, people have been stealing things from me. The scummy fiends who passed themselves off as teachers during my childhood robbed me of any desire to formally educate myself. The child abusers who call themselves child psychologists stole years of my life with false statements and false reasoning. Ever since I saw this film in 1988, I wanted to be turned into a mechanised hulk so that I could make them pay by stealing their lives from them. Coupling this element with the corporate greed that leads to the creation of RoboCop is a gang led by Clarence, the most hyperactive and hyper violent villain I've seen in my life. If you added boobs to the guy, he would have perfectly resembled this schoolteacher I'd like to shoot apart in the same manner that the gang shoots Murphy apart. The manner in which he is killed by RoboCop had me standing up and clapping, it was executed so well, and so surprisingly. Where I am concerned, a Christ theme has to have three things. It has to have a likable protagonist, and this is something RoboCop delivers. It also has to have a multi-dimensional villain that I can identify with in spite of hating more than the Christian Coalition, and RoboCop delivers that as well. Lastly, it has to introduce and bind all its elements together in the most powerful manner possible. And RoboCop more than delivers. The scene in which RoboCop first walks into the police precinct is so well-realised that I still hear Ozzy Osbourne growling \"I am Iron Man!\" in my head whenever I watch it. Don't let the negative comments of those who don't understand the film fool you. As a man who studies literature and the English language like it is growing out of his ears, I can firmly tell you that this is the best Christ theme of the twentieth century, bar none. Rivalled only by the Star Wars saga, and successfully gripping in ways where The Matrix was just pathetic and hilarious, if you only ever see one film about justice, make it this one!" "I'm 15. I remember I had a tape of Robocop and I had been watching it for 7 years, but I didn't realize, at the time, that I had been watching the edited version the whole time. I didn't finally get a chance to see the uncut version until about 3 years ago. I have to admit that I had missed a lot during those 7 years. Boy I was in for a rude awakening when I watched this. Robocop has to be one of the violentist movies of the late 1980's. The scene where Murphy is murdered by Clarence and his thugs is absolutely horrific. The ED209 test scene is also horrific in a sense. Everything in Robocop is perfect. The cast, especially Kurtwood Smith's character is clearly an evil man, with no remorse or guilt for his ruthless actions and you know that his own demise will be very deserving. Peter Weller is the perfect choice for the unwilling and troubled Robocop who is haunted by the memories of his family as well as his own murder. 10/10" "STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs Having watched this unforgettable action/sci-fi classic again last time after at least 2 and a half years,I am still completely awed by it.There is'nt a level this masterpiece dos'nt work on.As an action movie,as an intelligent vision of the future (more intelligent and understandable than Blade Runner ever was,and imaginative too)and in terms of brilliantly written charecters.This film is nearly 15 years old,and still today,the special effects are as breathtakingly amazing as they were back then.They are utterly timeless.I certainly hope,in 2002,this film gets some kind of 15th anniversary celebration,like Fawlty Towers celebrated 25 years on UK Gold,maybe a re release on mainstream video for this one. Another thing I came to decide having seen this again,was that all the spin offs from it,the two sequels and the TV series,were for losers.Yes,accept no imitations,this is the definitive,only version of Robocop.Take no notice of the rest of that crap,this now glares out to me as the one main,most important instance where they should have just left the original how it is.*****" "\"RoboCop\" was a major surprise for me when I saw it back in 1987. I didn't think this was going to be all that great. It looked ugly and grimy, and usually movies that look ugly and grimy turn me off. I saw it, and I was glad because this movie took me by surprise. \"RoboCop\" is a very entertaining (and very violent) science fiction/action/thriller that works on just about every level. Peter Weller stars as Alex Murphy, a cop in the city of Old Detroit who gets killed in the line of duty by some truly hateful criminals. Afterwards he is brought back to life, but not as a normal human being. The evil corporation OCP that runs all the police departments have turned this man into RoboCop, part man, part machine. They feel that since crime rate is at an absolute high (and since their earlier robotic experiment ED-209 was a big violent flop), RoboCop is the answer to stop it. And boy does he ever. However there's a little twist in between all the violence. He still has memories of when he was Murphy, and remembers the creeps who killed him. With the help of his partner Lewis (played wonderfully by Nancy Allen), they go after the bad guys. The two main villains in the film give brilliant performances. Veteran character actor Ronny Cox had his first nasty role here as Dick Jones, the #2 guy at the OCP department who creates ED-209 and becomes mad as hell when a younger OCP executive creates RoboCop after the ED-209 experiment fails; and Kurtwood Smith gives one of the meanest performances of all-time as Clarence Bodicker, the leader of the evil gang that kills Murphy. It's really hard to believe that a decade after playing this memorably evil bad guy, Smith would go on to do comedy on the current TV sitcom \"That 70's Show\". As for the other performances, Weller is perfect in the lead, Allen has one of her best film roles as the sidekick, Miguel Ferrer is very good as Morton, RoboCop's creator, Robert DoQui is very funny as Sgt. Reed (the boss at police headquarters where Murphy/RoboCop works at), and Daniel O'Herlihy has a nice small part as the head of OCP who is known to everyone as the Old Man. \"RoboCop\" was Dutch director Paul Verhoeven's first American movie, and it's a winner. One of the things that he does here that really makes the film work is the sense of humor that he put into it. Even though \"RoboCop\" is brutally violent at times, it's also brutally hilarious. I laughed a lot while watching this movie, and that was the biggest surprise for me. But the main reason to see \"RoboCop\" are the action and special effects sequences, and they're terrific. The film is ugly and grimy at times which I expected, but in the long run, it didn't bother me. \"RoboCop\" is so well-made that I didn't care if it looked bleak. This is an excellent movie. And forget about the two sequels that followed. Neither \"RoboCop 2\" or \"RoboCop 3\" came close to matching the excitement, humor, and thrills of the original. ***1/2 (out of four)" "Wow, I love this movie so much. I just bought the Criterion DVD edition and it is worth every penny. Lots of cool extras (audio commentary, storyboards, etc) and the violent scenes are now uncut bloodier and more gruesome than before! This is my favorite film Paul Verhoeven has made, with Total Recall as a close #2. Hidden underneath all the ultra-violence and comic-book-style special effects there is a brilliant satire of what America was about in the 1980s. The acting very underrated as each actor gives a colorful performance which suits their characters perfectly. Ronny Cox plays a great villan and I can't understand why he is never used much in other movies. The entire cast is great. Peter Weller is the perfect choice to play Robocop. The music score and sound are done very well, and a real treat to experience on a home theater system. One of my favorite movies, and one of the best Science Fiction movies I've ever seen. They just don't make movies like this anymore and forget about the sequels to this too." "Robocop is Paul Veherhoven at his finest. The movie is not for the faint of heart. It is a gory, gritty, and very powerful movie that is both visually stunning and emotionally draining. The violence in this movie is intense. There are some scenes that will cause some people to cringe. However, underneath Robocop are some powerful messages about society, the media, business, crime, and identity. Dick Jones says \"Good business is where you find it.\" A laughable premise in such a violent movie, until you realize that many businesses behave no differently than the crooks in this movie." "When Robocop premiered in Copenhagen, released in what was - and still is - Denmark´s biggest cinema (the Imperial), the reviews where to some extent furious. One even cried out, -The stinkiest of movies on Copenhagen´s largest screen! I, however, had the thrill of my life. Now I´m not a violent man - as a matter of fact far from it - I couldn´t harm a fly. But this film, despite it´s over-use of graphic violence, grabbed me by the you know what and held me firmly to the seat. For the last decade or so I´ve seen it perhaps 20 times, and it still amazes me how Verhoeven has managed to put a film together that has a lot to say - beneath the surface of ultraviolence. Especially the news - and commercial spots are todays classics, and to make matters worse, some of it´s prophecies almost happen these days. The pace is excellent, filming by Jost Vacano is clearly innovative and Basil Poledouris´ score is superb. When it comes to stop-animation it might be goofy-looking today, but at the time of release it was state of the art. And given the fact that Peter Weller is actually convincing as metallic monster you might even talk about good acting. I could go on and on, but then I would begin to bore you. However, Verhoeven probably had no idea he made what became an all time SciFi-classic, but the sequel (Tom Noonan is OK) and in particular the third Robocop do no more good than a one-legged man in an a** kicking contest. Maybe my mind is a mess - Robocop ranks in my over-all top 3.and it has to be considered a clean 10." "It is simply impossible to criticise this film. It is totally efficient and without a single flaw in any aspect. The plot is beautifully constructed, goes at breakneck pace, and is filled with stunning set pieces. The script is witty, very quotable (\"Stay out of trouble\") and it doesn't let a single line go to waste. The amazing shiny, metallic special effects invoke a vision of the future in which capitalism is rampant - remember this was before the Berlin Wall fell and Communism collapsed. It is totally plausible. This could have just been a straightforward action movie, but Verhoeven has turned it into a revenge thriller, a quest for identity, a parallel of Jesus' death-and-rebirth (at one stage Murphy walks on water) and a hilarious comedy rolled into one." "... Or, Paul Verhoeven conquers the world. More people have seen RoboCop than probably any other film by him, and his genius is that he can work in big-budget genres and never stoop to thinking that he ought to be more responsible. RoboCop is funny, violent, clever and moving. No sane person would ever want to _watch_ a sequel, let alone make one. People accuse Verhoeven of crypto-fascism, in that he never seems to offer some sort of \"positive\" alternative to the nightmare worlds he portrays. But he says, and I agree with him, that he's just being realistic. A great film. He didn't make another one as good until Starship Troopers." "Robocop's vision of the future is somewhat dark and gritty but proves to be a most enjoyable tale of Alex Murphy (Peter Weller), the good cop who gets killed in the line of duty. Only to be reborn as a high tech tool of justice. This is the first of what have become the more memorable Paul Verhoeven films and definitely the best of the Robocop series. His almost trade mark use of blood and excessive violence is evident here and often leaves you wincing in sympathetic pain for the characters on screen, you honestly start felling sorry for some of them. The movie works well on a number of levels and proves to be a highly entertaining action film with just a hint of something higher at work. As an action film it is highly successful, it provides witty one liners and makes for excellent bang for your buck. But as a social satire it also functions, it makes a healthy stab at the values we are adopting in out lives. As Science Fiction it is one of the more enjoyable outings of the late eighties. It is interesting to note the characters in this a clever little film. Most of the human characters seem shallow, yet logically the most shallow character (Robocop) seems to be the only human element in the film. The movie follows a pretty predictable story line, boy makes good, boy goes out for revenge, boy is framed, boy comes back as a hero despite all odds. Despite the lack of a surprising story, it is still is a highly entertaining film, providing as many gasps as laughs and leaves you at the end of it thinking `Hell I wanna be a Robot!' It is however interesting to note that yes old Robo is cased in Titanium, practically invincible to the oncoming onslaught of bullets and other things nasty that no one thinks to shoot him in the mouth. Its not like he's moving too fast for them to do this. I wonder perhaps if he also has Titanium teeth."

"Robocop is not a film I was keen to see. I am not a big fan of action movies, especially when they forsake story and characters for yet more special effects. So, the prospect of watching a cyborg hero shooting his way through villains in futuristic Los Angeles left me rather unimpressed. However, when I finally saw the film, it blew me away. Robocop is a wolf in a sheep's skin. It is a satire written for people who hate satires. Most people who'll see this film won't even notice. Robocop is Paul Verhoeven's 'Modern Times', but it is much subtler in delivering its message than Chaplin. Superficially we are given a vision of the future, a bleak future with rampant crime and rampant capitalism. It is not an entirely consistent vision, as advances/changes in science and society are immense while people still seem to wear the same clothes, live in the same houses, go to the same shops, drive the same cars as they did in 1987. Well, it is 1987. We are not shown the future at all, we are shown a caricature of today, we see the present through the eyes of a cartoonist. Robocop works perfectly well as an action flick and it delivers all the cliches we expect; since it has more humour than your average special effects bonanza it is very entertaining to watch. What makes it special though is the social comment beneath the surface." "In a dystopia future, crime ridden Detroit is being protected by a police force run by Omni Consumer Products. Omni is looking to replace inner city Detroit with Delta City. They want to clean up the crime with new robotic cops. When the latest robot ED 209 malfunctions, they need RoboCop as the backup plan. Officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is new in the dangerous precinct, and he's paired up with the rough Officer Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen). In a wild chase with master criminal Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith), Alex is captured and seriously tortured. When he dies, Omni takes ownership of his body to create RoboCop. This is great 80s sci-fi action. It is fun. The FX is good for the 80s. The cheese factor is high, but it's never ridiculous. RoboCop looks super cool. I wish they had better CGI back then, and better production value. Sometimes the action looks light. The production design lacks imagination with the exception of RoboCop and ED 209. There are good fun actors especially Miguel Ferrer and Ronny Cox. Miguel is great as the sleazy corporate climber. The story has just enough dark social commentary." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Dead or alive, you're coming with me. In the future Detroit is overrun with crime to the point that the police department has become aligned(albeit reluctantly)with a technological corporation known as OCP who are planning to rebuild the city \"for the better\", to provide better homes and increase employment across the board. They are also in the process of creating robotic police officers to replace human ones and decrease the rate of crime. Dick Jones(a ruthless Ronny Cox)is VP to \"the old man\", head of OCP(Dan O'Herlihy), but loses his position when a giant robot his division had been working on \"has a glitch\" which results in the murder of an employee during a presentation. The eager Bob Morton(Miguel Ferrer portraying his usual asshole)swoops in to present a robotic creation of his own, due to appear as soon as he can get the right kind of \"parts\" to assimilate the \"new breed of cop\". That happens when a police officer, Murphy(Peter Weller), is crucified(director Verhoeven claims in an interview that he wanted the cop's brutal murder to mirror Jesus Christ's own death)by a vicious drug lord, Clarence J Boddicker(a repulsive Kurtwood Smith)and his gang(including Ray Wise and Paul McCrane). His partner, Anne(a deglammed Nancy Allen), sees this horrifying development and later recognizes that parts of him had been used for OCP's Robocop(mainly his face and brain and perhaps some internal organs shielded by armor). This is what Bob proudly unveils--a robotic, programmed police officer designed to apprehend suspects and follow directives assigned to him through OCP. So is the plot where Robocop dutifully goes out to halt crimes in progress--a rape, liquor store robbery, gas station robbery, Robocop steps in as an avenger with a badge, but something happens that Bob and his scientists didn't anticipate. Murphy, somehow, remains active despite a \"brain sweep\" and bits of humanity emerge, memories(particularly of those who murdered him)resurface, giving Robocop an incentive to pursue those who killed the man he once was. Secretly Jones and Boddicker are actually in cahoots, first eliminating a thorn in their side, Bob, and soon focusing on getting rid of Robocop. Will these heathens be successful or will Murphy get his revenge? Through Verhoeven's superb direction(the way he stages the action scenes, interspersing live action with stop motion effects, not to mention, the camera-work and overall pacing and style), a wicked, witty, razor-sharp script(the satire on commercialism, materialistic society, and dangers of potential technological breakthroughs placed in the hands of the wrong people) , really vile villains worthy of destruction(Murphy's sadistic demise makes him quite the worthy figure of sympathy), and awe-inspiring depictions of Robocop(and especially Ed 209)at work--along with the magnificent make-up and Robocop design by Rob Bottin, as well as, Basil Poledouris' rousing, stirring score--this action-packed, ultra-violent sci-fi extravaganza has stood the test of time. I think it's just as riveting a sci-fi action flick as THE TERMINATOR, it's brother so to speak. There's plenty of acidic humor which deftly matches the overall tone of the film, it's a dangerous world out there, both in the boardroom and on the streets. Phil Tippett and his stop motion team do a phenomenal job with Ed 209, with Verhoeven and company amazingly able to effectively have the giant robot occupy the same screen as human characters. The highlight for me, besides the human atomic monster splattered across a car, would be the battle between Robocop and Ed 209 inside OCP headquarters, the building taking as much damage as the combating robots." "This one goes for the jugular. Verhoeven has never exactly had a reputation for the light, the family friendly, or holding back in criticism. As one of his satires, this is quite simply excellent and utterly ferocious, in its depiction of society and big business... of the future. Yes, that's it. The writing is marvelous. The dialog is endlessly quotable. The characters are credible and portrayed well. The gritty, and sometimes intentionally over-the-top tone is masterfully achieved, and lasts for the entire duration. The action is incredible, and all memorable. The suit is amazing. The special effects are extremely well-done, with a handful of exceptions, most having to do with limitations of the time. The symbolism is exceptional. Consider what not to take at face value in this. As with other of Paul's works, bring your brain for this one, if for absolutely no other reason, remember it says \"sci-fi\" as a genre, also. Be aware that there are fairly gruesome and disturbing things in this, some would call it downright distasteful, most notably in the violence and themes, and \"intense\" isn't exactly a wrong word to associate with this. The Parents Guide on here can help let you know what to expect, if such bothers you. There is also a little nudity, and plenty of language. I recommend this to any fan of science fiction, any of the actors(Kurtwood Smith can be a bad-ass), of clever films, and of the concept. 8/10" "This is the first installment of the Robocop movies and I to this day still love it. The story is very well done and for 1987, a little ahead of it's time. The concept of Robocop is intelligently written. The setup is Detroit. The city is overrun by crime and the police are so concerned with it that showing up at work could be their last day in ever. This filming is so well done that you, the viewer feel like you are a part of this depressing and worn out police station. I won't go into details any further, but the acting is solid, the story is well done, and the villains are SO nasty that you will really hate them. If your a squeamish one, be careful. This movie is pretty damn violent. The Last Word: This is a solid and fun ride. Still remains a classic, just avoid the sequels." "Robocop has to be one of the most perfect and flawless transitions of sci-fi concepts/comics/cartoons into a real motion picture. While those are normally recipies for disaster, for once it actually looks better and luck may have even played a huge part given how the concept fits perfectly. The movie is not all about action either and has a huge emotional element to it. Plenty of surprises and an excellent plot await if you have not already seen this movie. The special effects are as well developed as those times allowed. Unfortunately, the sequels have been highly disappointing. Even the TV series cannot touch this and may even kill interest in this franchise." "Robocop is the most violent movie ever made. Taxi Driver has to be next. The first time I saw this movie I was about 14. Now that I am a little older I understand it more. I bought the movie in its unrated version and I noticed how much they cut out. This movie was cut to avoid an X rating. Now I have the cut version again. The thing I like about getting the R rated and unrated versions are comparing the two. I think Peter Weller does a good job as Alex Murphy. Also Nancy Allen does a good job also as his partner. Ronny Cox is the best villain. I think the commercials are hilarious. I think Total Recall is more violent than this is." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "It starts out interesting enough Two cops, Murphy (Peter Weller) and Lewis (Nancy Allen), take off in pursuit some crooks in a moderately well-done car chase. Murphy and Lewis catch up to them in a warehouse. They separate, and Lewis is forced to watch as they almost obliterate her partner. She gets him to a hospital where he is clinically pronounced dead. Meanwhile, OCP, the company that provides most of the funding and technology to law enforcement agencies has developed a new Cyborg project, and as you may suspect, Murphy becomes their first test subject. The brazenness of the film is tempered with the director's care to take the material seriously. So while the dialog is a bit cheesy and the criminals are highly exaggerated, the plot does not suffer. More attention could've been given to character writing, but that fails to scar the film. The set design as well as Robocop's suit and armor are superlative for its time, and the music is well-scored and apposite for each scene. The design of ED-209 was also considerably advanced for its time, and the further personification of it added some light humor, especially when it fell down the stairs. The art department did a incredible job with Emil's (Paul McCrane) skin meltingit was surprisingly realistic. However, the latter squirting blood almost made me laugh out loud. I guess ya win some, ya lose some. Despite the fact that Weller (Robocop) is limited in his acting since he plays a Cyborg, you still feel his loneliness and isolation. Lewis recognizing him and helping him was handled well. Furthermore, you can really feel the injustice of it all in the scene in the garage when all the cops open fire on him. I wish it was explained more what parts of him are human and what is Cyborg, but I suppose one can infer this from his actions. The Old Man (Dan O'Herlihy) firing Dick thus enabling Robocop to kill him was niceI actually didn't see it coming. And the last scene where The Old Man asks RoboCop his name gave the film closure. VERDICT: The performances are nothing special to behold, but even now, it is *still* abundantly clear that this film set a milestone for its time, and can be appreciated as such. Recommended to all, whether you're in search of an original futuristic film or just looking for something to pass the time. 7.0 out of 10.0" "If you're a man and you have not seen RoboCop, you might as well not have a penis. One simply cannot describe themselves as men unless this movie has been viewed by their own eyes...and enjoyed. I say that because RoboCop is a film made just for men, a great one at that, and if you haven't seen it then there's something seriously wrong with you. And if you have seen it and don't like it, you could possibly be a woman, have a hormonal imbalance causing a lack of testosterone, or are a serious steroid juicer. Either way, it comes down to the penis and or lack thereof. Don't let it go to waste by not enjoying this movie. Respect it. Now that that's out of the way, let's get to the damn film shall we? RoboCop has everything an essential action movie needs, violence, destruction, guns, an evil antagonist (played marvelously by Kurtwood Smith), and of course the classic one-liners. The film exceeds above the rest in the same genre because of a slick script and good direction...not to mention just one kickass idea to start with. Some of the effects have aged, particularly the animation sequences featuring the Godsend of man-movie villains, the ED-209. Although they have aged, naturally, I don't feel that it takes away from the film. And let's face it, the ED-209 is just bad. I would love to have one for myself, you know, for simple entertainment purposes. hmmm. I'll just leave it at that just because I don't want any G-men showing up at my door. I would not be too quick to label this film as clichéd either. It was made in the '80s, where almost all action and sci-fi clichés were created, so one must not take too much away from the film simply because of this fact. All in all, an excellent film, even if it is a simple action flick. Not only that, this film was a trend setter in it's day...this fact cannot be denied. The hand scene alone, although ultra-violent and simple, is something that will never be forgotten. And now that we have the wonderful technology of DVD's, one can now watch this beloved scene in slow motion. Sometimes I think things are invented and created just for me. But then again, maybe I have problems. Overall, RoboCop is an excellent action/sci-fi film that set the stage for films the come. And although it's still a simple action flick, it is a definite unique, creative, and well-made one. I highly recommend this film to any man with a penis." "On his first day out on the streets of Detroit, Officer Murphy is brutally killed by known thug leader, Clarence Boddicker. Scientists at OCP are able to use what remains of Murphy's body and build a new heavily armed cyborg police officer, one that could rid the streets of crime forever. Paul Verhoeven has been called many things in his career, bonkers, challenging and visionary, here with his first perceived block buster American feature, he showcases all of those things. Robocop on the page {and with its title} looked like your average run of the mill sci-fi shoot them up, with its basic premise not exactly oozing originality either. But Verhoeven had screenwriter's Edward Neumeier & Michael Miner in his corner, and they came up with a superior script to fully realise his vision. That Robocop is a satirical critique of totalitarianism and corporate corruption is now a given. Yet it wasn't at first evident to the summer block buster crowd, but Robocop has stood up well to critical re-examinations and the depth digging that so many have afforded it. So with the script he wanted in place, Verhoeven utilised his memories from childhood, where his Netherlands home was taken over by a stomping German army, and added in the destruction factor, with no amount of technical expertise as well. Verhoeven paints an unhinged portrait of this Detroit {actual location shoot was parts of Texas}, with skew whiff angles and bizarre twists lining the picture, the special effects even today looking tremendous. Robocop is extremely violent, especially in the directors cut that's now widely available, but even during the most wincing scenes, it stays brisk and sparky, and on his side is that his characters are as inhuman as the title protagonist is!. Thus the fusion of berserker sci-fi and human realism sits easy with the viewer, with the result serving notice to what a fine director Verhoeven can be. Peter Weller dons the Robo suit {enduring agony for weeks on end apparently} and does what is required, and Nancy Allen kicks buttocks as Murphy's partner, Anne Lewis. But it's with the unsavoury characters that Robocop gains its acting kudos. Ronny Cox, Miguel Ferrer and a wickedly vile Kurtwood Smith dominate proceedings, helped immeasurably by the nature of the script. Verhoeven is thought to be a hard character on set, demanding much from all involved, even driving the normally amiable Weller to thoughts of violence against his director. But few, if any of those involved in Robocop can now say the final result wasn't worth it, because between them they made a genre classic. 9/10" "Add another review" "Find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your Watchlist and rate your favorite movies and TV shows on your phone or tablet!")("Movies, TV & Showtimes" "Celebs, Events & Photos" "News & Community" "Watchlist" "" "Find industry contacts & talent representation" "Manage your photos, credits, & more" "Showcase yourself on IMDb & Amazon" "Sign in with Facebook Other Sign in options" "Own the rights?" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "For a movie that is 30 years old, the social commentary is still great. Its got commercials for fake futuristic products, the fun of crazy action sequences, and one of my all-time favorite robots/droids in ED- 209. ED-209 is great and I wish someone made a small one that really interacted with you without telling me it was going to shoot me then actually shooting me. I don't need toys that murder. Peter Weller is great and the supporting cast is equally astounding. In watching this with the commentary I was shocked at how much thought went in to each scene. My only concern would be how violent and hard-R rated it is. I will have to wait until my children are at least 5 to watch it (just kidding)." "I've watched this about a million times and I liked it. I loved the action scenes including the shoot out in the factory. I like the special effects with ED-209 and Robocop. The commercials in this film made it a bit humorous. I used to have a Robocop action figure but it doesn't work anymore and it's lost. That's the reason why I like Robocop." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Robocop 1987 Robocop is a film I hold very close to my heart. As a school boy when this film was released my father wouldn't allow me to watch it. The graphic violence and foul language was deemed unfit for an eleven year old boy and rightly so. I begged and pleaded but dad wouldn't budge. His mind was set. My school friends however had all seen it. I don't think there was a VHS copy in my neighbourhood that hadn't been played within an inch of its life. Of course every school break time was filled with discussion of this sci-fi masterpiece. So I learned the film from start to finish without even laying my eyes on the screen. Every line, every scene all in my imagination as I listened in awe to my friends as they retold the tale of Alex Murphy a Detroit police officer who is violently gunned down by a gang of vicious criminals and then reconstructed as a crime fighting cyborg. I say violently but even that is an understatement. If you opt to watch the directors cut the gore of Murphy's deconstruction is almost too much to bare. Limbs are detached from body with murderous gunfire. The violence feels real, you can almost taste the brain matter. But this is necessary in order to convey the brutal world these characters live in. Paul Verhoevens film pokes fun at modern day America and the massive corporations that control our lives. All of this is done with a good dose of satire and a wink at the camera. The TV commercials that play throughout the movie are a work of genius. A particular one involving a gas guzzling American made car named the 6000 SUX, an American tradition which proudly returns 8.2mpg. There are so many delights in this film that are wasted on an eleven year old school boy. However when my father finally came around some few years later and allowed me to watch this movie I was blown away like Murphy himself. My imagination was being presented before me right there on the screen. I knew every line but to see it actually happening was mesmerising. The performances are exceptional, particularly by Peter Weller as Robocop. His movement, his on screen presence. A story of a man becoming a machine and then a man again perfectly portrayed. Supporting cast are also superb. Kurtwood Smith created one of the most evil and memorable villains since Darth Vader. Granted the special effects by today's standards look weak but compared to the recent remake, the original film has depth and texture. No CGI can replicate this. Take ED209 for example he is as menacing as he is comical. A killer robot tank that is flummoxed by a staircase. The clumsy stop motion effects only elevate this. I recently revisited this film and after thirty years I am still bowled over by its genius. Robocop is more than just an action flick it's a clever and comical finger poke at the world we live in." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This is one of the most clever and influential pieces, not just for science-fiction, but film as a whole. I can explain the sudden drop in ratings. It's ignorant people rating this down because they're confusing it with the 2014 film. That is a remake of this film. Watch this film and culture yourselves." "One thing I don't think I ever hear mentioned about \"RoboCop\" is the sound design. His movements and footsteps sound fantastic, and they're as unique as the sound of a proton pack, lightsaber or time- traveling DeLorean. It's one of the many reasons this is such an enduring movie. \"RoboCop\" is so effective because it strikes the precise balance between human drama and the comic book outrageous. It's got everything: memorable villains, great score, mid-'80s ultra-violence, cheap (hysterical) jabs at corporate America and a delightfully glib outlook on the media. Seriously, absorb just five minutes of present-day cable news, and suddenly those Media Break segments seem all too real. I think that's more unnerving than how the movie presaged the woeful state of Detroit. There's a real heart to this movie, which is why it's one of my all-time favorites. The idea that a corporation can own anything from the police to an entire city - but not a man's soul. I dunno, even after all of the bloodspray and beautiful matte paintings, what really brings a smile to my face is the main character's utterance of his own name in the closing moments. I mean, really, does it get any better than that? 10/10" "The ads in this movie are hilarious, a very nice unexpected touch. They're not explained but fit in with the tone and are perfect as comic relief. The movie clearly has a sense of irony and exaggeration about it. The violence is over-the-top. Cops are getting killed left and right. No character is safe from getting hurt. The story keeps moving so it's easy to be engaged the whole time. Robocop is like the perfect boy's movie except it's too violent for kids. It's loaded with testosterone. It's got guns, cars, goodies and baddies, explosions, blood, shoot-outs, chases, angry old guys shouting, a giant robot and Robocop himself. It's only missing hot women in terms of the male fantasy. Whatever we watch action films for, Robocop has a good amount of it. Many parts were exciting to watch and made me laugh or at least smile a lot. The robot, ED-209, is extremely cool. The stop-motion animation is jumpy but detailed and effective and the sound-effects and mean voice are intimidating. You really feel his presence. I'm sure I would instantly drop to the ground and wet my pants if he threatened me :) Robocop himself has an interesting aura around him. He's like a superhero. The other police are curious about him. He's tall and moves mechanically but appears friendly and reliable. Against criminals, he's efficient and apparently indestructible. We're not sure how human or awake or alive he is but that gets developed throughout the movie in a satisfying way. I would have liked to see a sequel except they aren't meant to be very good. Like Spider-man and Batman, his relationship with society and the police is rocky. Sometimes he's respected and looked up to. Other times there is fear and distrust. This movie is violent and dark but still manages to be fun and entertaining. It's not too grim and has a sense of humour about itself. Many of the characters are jerks and we basically celebrate when they get killed. They're archetypes of the kinds of people everyone hates. The bad guys are hilariously 1-dimensional. What I like is how Robocop cuts straight to the point. Everything about a person is obvious from the start. There may be little twists or surprises but at least we know where people's hearts are. The swearing is particularly refreshing and enjoyable. It's such an efficient way to express feelings which is used appropriately and to great effect here. Robocop gives hope to a city that's halfway to hell. There is a nice human element. The ongoing struggle between the police and criminals. The camaraderie they each have among themselves. Like Batman, Robocop is shaking things up which some people like and some don't. I didn't like the first two X-men movies because they were stupid and yet took themselves so seriously. They weren't fun. Robocop doesn't make that mistake. It doesn't pretend to be anything more than a story about this awesome cop-robot-thing going around killing bad guys. And yet, because of its irony and fearlessness, there are plenty of ideas that come up throughout this movie. Can we trust an armed machine to enforce the law? Will that happen in the future? How much risk is acceptable? Is the news anything more than mere entertainment? The male reporter seems to smile the whole time in this movie. Is it ever moral to kill? And why are men obsessed with big guns and cars (other than them being inherently awesome)?" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "From a visceral standpoint a heck of a good movie. Revenge from Murphy for his murder by the thugs, the return of at least some humanity to Robocop from Nancy Allen. When Robocop goes in to the drug lab he is looking for the ones who \"killed\" him. He takes out I don't know how many of them, goes after the number two man, Dick Jones, at OCP. This is where directive four comes in to play, any attempt to arrest a senior OCP officer will lead to shut down. Going to arrest the smarmy faced Dicky Robocop overcomes the shut down, encounters the Robocop upgrade, goes to the basement where the upgrade can not handle the stairs, gets the crap shot out of him by human cops, is rescued by Nancy Allen. Kurtwood Smith is really good as the A hole crime thug. I love it when he gets his. Nancy Allen brings Robo tools, food, and weapons. Getting some military grade weapons the thugs go after Robo thinking they have the upper hand. I guess they forgot to read the script. They get picked off one by one but of course Kurty runs away, Nancy chases, he crashes and is finally killed. So Robo goes to arrest the Dickey but can't until he is fired. Gee guess what happens now? Dicky not only gets shot to pieces but is blown out a very high window." "In futuristic Detroit, an honest police officer (Peter Weller) is gunned down by a ruthless gang. His body is turned into a robot to be used by the police force. He now makes a cop who is physically tough, has myriad other features like precision targeting and recording statements from criminals and is dedicated to his job. He is an immediate success but what happens when he detects corruption and crime among his superiors. The more realistic a character is the more they elicit the right kind of emotions in the audience, be it like or dislike. That's the reason why we like the villains in superhero flicks; they are not real by any stretch of imagination. RoboCop is similar to a superhero but his rivals are not super villains. They are real people; people with power. They do pose the threat of taking over the city/world because they already own half the city. Their motives are multi-layered and complex. The stakes are high as RoboCop may or may not win the day. And all this leads up to one of the most emotionally intense, action-packed climaxes ever put on cinema. The character of RoboCop has been delicately dealt with. The differences and similarities in his human and robot personalities, the reactions of people towards him, his discovery of his origins and the internal conflict he goes through all feel real. The supporting characters are meaty and well cast. Peter Weller himself does a good job considering he is wearing a heavy costume and his eyes are covered with a helmet for most part of the movie. There is a lot of 80's feel to it for a movie set in the future and some of the effects look dated. But that is just nitpicking as they are not distracting in the least bit." "Paul Verhoeven wanted to implant a Jesus like feeling to the whole notion of being reborn and there are visual clues to that (walking on water and so on). Of course no one would think of Jesus coming back in a violent fashion like that. So it's not a clear cut comparison or analogy for that matter. The violence in the movie is extreme and there are certain scenes you will not forget that easily (and the effects are still holding up). The \"you have 20 seconds to comply\" scene in particular is more than (in)famous. But its also the performance by Peter Weller that carries that story. His relationships with his Ex-Partner and the strange mix of human and robot is more than appealing. A great movie that did stand the test of time" "To me, there is no movie that can compare to such an astonishing, unique, motivating film like this one. Honestly, this movie is the real definition of a movie with a true morality. Robocop truly grasps an unforgettable story that will make you want to repeat this movie in your head endlessly until it's the last memory that you will ever remember. This movie will forever be engraved in my heart and I tend to visualize this movie in my head from time to time. I will never forget such a magnificent film like this one. Robocop is truly an emotional, awe-inspiring movie that just can't be forgotten in such little time. Not only does this film have an amazing storyline to it, but it also has a spectacular cast with amazing acting. This beautiful film will forever be acknowledged by me and I will always love Robocop until death."

"There's no other way of saying it, but Robocop is an absolute classic. Ignore the 'so-so' 2014 remake and concentrate on the original. It's all you need. It was possibly too good and couldn't even be matched by its sequels. Yes, it's hyper-violent and totally adult in nature, but it also has a wonderfully subtle layer of satire underneath all the gore and bloodshed. In case you don't know, a policeman is gunned down in futuristic Detroit, only to be resurrected with no memory of his former life as an indestructible cyborg lawman. Of course his memories soon start to trickle back and he begins to want to track down those who 'killed' him for more than just a slap on the wrist. It's packed full of memorable scenes and catchphrases and the only people who probably won't appreciate this film are those with a real distaste for violence. It really is the perfect little film for what it is. It never tries to be deep and meaningful, only loud, proud and entertaining. And it succeeds of ever one of those levels. http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "I was about seven or eight, when My Mom picked this movie up at one my town's local video stores. Immediately after watching it, I loved it, and on subsequent returns to that video store, I had to incessantly beg my mother to re- rent it for me. Ever since the day I first watched the film, it has been one of my favorite movies. The idea of RoboCop isn't particularly new, many movies, comic books, pulp magazines, short stories, and TV shows, have had more or less the same plot. However RoboCop takes it in a new direction. The plot is this: Things have gone to hell in Detroit, and a mega-corporation known as Omni Consumer Products or O.C.P., has taken control. Crime runs rampant all over the city, and one of the head members of O.C.P., must somehow find a solution to this problem. We then meet the main character: Officer Alex Murphy, who has just transferred to the roughest part of the city. Murphy and his new partner: Officer Anne Lewis, hear of a bank robbery that was committed by a local street gang. Murphy and Lewis pursue them to their hideout. The two police officers get separated, and Murphy is then cornered by the gang members and brutally shot to death. Sometime later, Murphy is resurrected by O.C.P. as the crime fighting cyborg, RoboCop! At first, Murphy has no knowledge or recollection of his life or of his family, but slowly his memories return, and RoboCop/Murphy must rediscover his humanity and seek vengeance for his brutal murder. RoboCop not only has stellar acting, outstanding special effects, but also an excellent and compelling story. This film has one of the most memorable scores, and a brilliant use of satire with its clever \"commercials\". Without a doubt, it is one of the best science- fiction films of all time, and definitely one of the best films to come out of the eighties. Check it out, and see it for yourself!" "One of the pioneers of cyberpunk genre where we look a few decades into the future into a world where crime and corruption rule and its up to few dedicated people to make the difference. RoboCop has earned the reputation of a classic because of its style and harsh satirical critique on modern society and its downfalls. It mocks the modern conventions of trying to make as much money as possible without caring about the end result. It also deals with the themes of identity, corruption, humanity and heroism. And throughout it all it's also a really good action film with blazing gun fights, brutal massacres and lovely special effects - especially for their time. One of the best things about this film is the role performance delivered by Peter Weller, the RoboCop himself. We don't get to see much of his face or expressions because of the helmet, but his voice alone is enough to carry the emotions and feelings he goes through. Even his robotic monotone has enough depth to make us feel for him and whenever a hint of emotion seeps through, it feels like a victory to both him and the viewer. RoboCop is one of those movies that need to be seen for the full experience to sink in. Its plot isn't overly complex, but it's the way the story is told that's important. The little touches. If you're a fan of science fiction or societal satire, then this one is definitely a movie for you." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "I bet it must be a lot of fun working with Paul Verhoeven, so long as you don't mind getting messy! In the 80s, his sci-fi/ action thrillers were some of the most imaginative shows out there. Along with the original TOTAL RECALL, the original ROBOCOP is his best work! And when you went to see one, what would you expect to see? Usually good guys battling bad guys, winding up in some pretty bloody fights. Characters in Verhoeven's films didn't so much get dead as get massacred! Anyway, now that I'm through with my little rant, let's get on to reviewing 1987's ROBOCOP. In some distant future, the city of Detroit has become a violent haven for criminals. Despite the best efforts of the police department, cops become casualties almost on a nightly basis. One morning, Alex Murphy (played expertly by Peter Weller) comes into work, having been transferred from a kinder, gentler precinct. He meets his new partner, Lewis (Nancy Allen) and before you know it, they are chasing after a van of criminals led by mad dog crime boss Clarence Boddicker (played icily by Kurtwood Smith). Following the criminals to their hideout, the cops get separated and Murphy dies in one of the most violent death scenes in movie history. Meanwhile, the head honchos at Omni Consumer Products (OCP, COP, get it?) are in the process of putting together a new law enforcement program. Murphy, now dead, gets enrolled and resurrected as Robocop. However, soon after, he recalls the men who killed him and goes on a rampage to find and apprehend them. There are many different layers of drama going on here, and I won't go into how it all ties together. With the remake out now in theaters, I don't know how it'll compare to the original. Just know that it's a roller-coaster ride of a film with a healthy dose of acid wit!" "Although it was surprisingly better than I expected, having never seen it before, I only watched this because I really liked the new version and wanted to compare the two. First I'll say, the Robo costume was pretty good for an 80's style sci-fi / action film, but the newer one is so much more sleek and mechanical looking. The story to this film is a lot better than I expected, but a lot of scenes were cheesily filmed and acted that I couldn't take most of it seriously. It was entertaining for the most part, although very violent, and still holds up today. This would have probably been one of my favorite films had I seen it in 1987, but seeing this after the impressive newer version, it doesn't quite compare to me. I know that a lot of people will disagree with me and this won't be a popular review, but it is a honest review and my own opinion. Cheers!" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" ". . . Tigers game, which makes Kurtwood Smith's Crimelord character the ONLY link between ROBOCOP's \"old Detroit\" and the REAL Detroit of 1987. Otherwise, the setting for this flick is far too clean, and the characters way too jovial. There's is and was nothing to laugh about in Detroit. There also are NO buildings even close to having a \"95th floor,\" the stated level of \"Omni Consumer Product's\" (OCP's) board room. OCP's grand plan is to ADD two million people to Detroit's population (which plummeted in reality from two million in 1950 to 700,000 and counting down today). This sort of population growth would be outrageous for ANY city in the northern U.S. (you'd have to go to Brazil or China to see such an overnight demographic shift). When Detroit politicians run amok, such as the city councilman in this ROBOCOP, they don't simply demand \"a car with cruise control\"--they filch $19 billion, like Kwame Kilpatrick and his cohorts. In a city where fire fighters hold telethons to restock their stations with toilet paper, there hasn't been any cash available for high tech ANYTHING for decades. But every time you purchase a Little Caesar's pizza, Clarence says the Tigers get better swings." "RoboCop (1987) takes place in the future crime ridden Detroit. After Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) gets massacred by violent robbers that are lead by the ruthless Clearance Boddicker, he gets rebuild by the OCP company as a crime fighting cyborg. This is an awesome 1980's action/sci-fi film. Even though, I have not seen the remake, I guarantee that this film will be way better. Peter Weller was wonderful as Murphy/RoboCop. He was able to be badass, but also maintain a good amount of heart that made us care for him. The part where he gets massacred by Clearance Boddicker's gang has got to be one of the most messed up scenes filmed. When he gets massacred and has everything taken away from him including his humanity, you really sympathize for him. Which is one of the films strongest parts. Kurtwood Smith was awesome as Clearance Boddicker. I really liked his character so much. He was despicable, ruthless, and sadistic, but he was so entertaining to watch. Other cast members do a capable job at their roles, however one that stands out is Ronny Cox as Dick Jones. The direction by Paul Verhoeven is very good and might say this is one of his best films. Also, it is one that put him on the map. The score by Basil Poledouris is very thrilling and gets you invested during the scenes where RoboCop kicks ass. The action scenes are very violent and bloody. This film was filmed during the time when action movies were R-rated, unlike today you have studios trying to make it more kid friendly and just make a quick buck. My only problem with the film is some special effects may seem outdated in today's standards, especially the parts where Dick Jones falls from the building and the ED-209 design looked very clunky, but that isn't to say that it hurts the film. RoboCop is an entertaining film that features many badass moments. Anyone who are fans of the science fiction/action genre then you will more then likely enjoy this film. It is still holds up very well even though some of the special effects are outdated in today's standards. 9/10 stars." "Robocop is one of the greatest SCI-FI/Action films ever made and an excellent,thrilling and unforgettable classic that combines amazing direction,a great cast,explosive Action,a terrific score and outstanding special make-up effects. All of those elements make Robocop one of my all-time favorite Action films and Paul Verhoevan at his best. Set in a futuristic Detroit,Michigan,Robocop tells the story of Alex Murphy(Peter Weller),a cop who has been transferred to a police station on a dangerous side of Detroit where crime is up. While on duty,Murphy is brutally murdered by a group of criminals and left for dead but is brought back to life by mega-corporation OCP(Omni Consumer Products)as Robocop,a half human half machine Cyborg that is assigned to protect and serve the public and uphold the law. But when Robocop starts having memories of his death as Alex Murphy,Robocop wants to hunt down the men who killed him and wants to get them at all costs and whether they're dead or alive they're coming with Robocop. Robocop is one of the most brilliant and dazzling SCI-FI/Action films of the 1980s and of all-time and is one of those movies that is an instant classic from the moment you watch it,an amazing movie that is up there with other excellent and brilliant SCI-FI/Action classics such as Blade Runner,The Terminator,Terminator 2:Judgment Day,Aliens,Predator,Predator 2,Escape From New York and The Road Warrior. Robocop is also a movie that keeps you glued to screen and is like a Comic Book or Graphic Novel coming to life because throughout the film there is an over the top and wild energy that never stops until the very end and everything in Robocop is pushed to the limit whether it's explosions,guns or the violence but despite all of those things Robocop has a style and demented weirdness that makes the movie less serious. There is a politically incorrect in your face no holds barred attitude that I love about Action movies from the 1970s,80s and 90s and is one of the main reasons the film holds up as a classic and has stood the test of time. What I also love about Robocop is that it's apart of the sub genre of SCI-FI that I have always love Dystopian Futuristic film where there is a society,major city or country that takes place in a dark future and Robocop's future in Detroit depicts a bleak future where law enforcement is falling apart,criminals are ruling the streets and big money corporations have taken over pretty much everything. While Robocop does take place in the future the movie never reveals what year Robocop takes place in giving the future in Detroit a more timeless feel. What is also great about Robocop is that while it's still an explosive Action film,there is also a great deal of Humor and Satire that is in the film and it is very funny whether it's with Robocop dealing with the criminals on the streets,the movie mocking American consumer culture,Television commercials or News Media which makes Robocop not only relevant in 1987 but for many years to come. The Humor and Satire can be seen as a precursor to director Paul Verhoeven two other amazing SCI-FI/Action films Total Recall and Starship Troopers. All three films would make a great triple feature. Robocop also has themes in the film dealing with greed,big business corporations and urban decay commenting on the President Reagan era of the 1980s in an honest and sometimes funny way. The Action and violent scenes in Robocop are amazing,bloody and sometimes brutal,(so brutal in fact that Robocop got an X-Rating from the MPAA)but the Action is done in such a way that it matches perfectly with the film's outlandish Comic Book tone. The Action is fast and so relentless you will never have time to catch your breath. The main character Robocop is one of the all-time great movie characters in SCI-FI and Action films because even though he is a machine Robocop is still a human inside the metal flesh and while Robocop is successful as Robocop he begins to discover the human side that he used to be in Alex Murphy and throughout the movie we see Robocop trying to find out who he really was in his past while being a cop. This element gives the movie and main character sadness and levels of depth that separates Robocop from the some of the other Action movies of the 1980s and is one the reasons Robocop is a classic character you will never forget. The ending of Robocop is great,exciting and explosive and is fantastic conclusion that will have you cheering at the screen. An tremendous ending. The cast is great. Peter Weller is excellent as Robocop/Alex Murphy,with Weller bringing power and depth to the role. Nancy Allen is terrific as Officer Anne Lewis,Robocop/Murphy's partner. Daniel O'Herlihy is great as The Old Man,a top executive at OCP. Ronny Cox is wonderful as Dick Jones,a top man at OCP. Kurkwood Smith is fantastic as Clarence Boddicker,a vicious criminal and killer. Miguel Ferrer is terrific as Bob Norton,a rival executive of Dick Jones that helps create Robocop. Robert DoQui(Sergeant Warren Reed),Felton Perry(Johnson),Ray Wise(Leon),Paul McCrane(Emil),Jesse Goins(Joe),Calvin Jung(Steve Minh)and Lee DeBroux(Sal)give good performances as well. The direction by Paul Verhoeven is brilliant and memorable,with Verhoeven always moving the camera and keeping the film moving at a tight pace while also doing a great job with the Action scenes. Incredible direction,Verhoeven. The score by Basil Poledouns is fantastic,powerful,epic and one of the best scores I have ever heard in an Action movie and matches the film perfectly. Amazing score,Poledouns. The special make-up effects by Rob Bottin are outstanding,realistic and is among the best work Bottin has ever done. Dazzling work,Bottin. In final word,if you love Science Fiction,Action Films or Paul Verhoeven,I highly suggest you see Robocop,an excellent,thrilling and unforgettable classic that you can watch again and again. Highly recommended. 10/10." "Robocop has become a cult classic for many movie buffs. And I have to agree. It has a great mix of humour, great dialogue and satire. Many find the violence --over the top--but if taken in context with the whole movie...its really a necessary element. I believe that this film was never---at any point---meant to be taken seriously. The first scenes, where we see two ridiculously funny T.V. presenters sets the tone for what is to come. I don't agree with those who call this science fiction. The word is FUTURISTIC. This is never boring and moves along at a nice pace. The characters are well acted and memorable. Well worth watching ...and like all cult movies...can be enjoyed on multiple viewings." "Things will get worse before they get better (if they ever get better, especially in Detroit). In one possible future, it could become a mad world of ecological, economical, political, and commercial excesses. It could be a terrifying breeding ground for more extreme and violent crime, which would call for a more extreme and powerful type of police officer. Enter RoboCop: a hybrid of man and machine to make a perfect cop. This film starts off hard and fast, and remains perfectly entertaining throughout its short run-time. It's jam-packed with pulpy hardcore action, with loads of shootouts, chases, and some really gnarly kills. The film strikes a perfect pace, never lingering too long on any of the action or drama, but still offering just enough to satisfy. The film gets really extreme with its exaggerated (perhaps cheesy) level of acting, its level of bloodshed, and its satire, but it's awesome that way. Most of the film's appeal, however, is that it's so fundamental and simple. It goes through a basic death-and-rebirth storyline, which provides the origin of the character and drives the rest of the story through retribution and corporate conspiracy. There is just enough attention to the characters to make them relevant and endearing. On top of that, however, the film also packs in a lot of thought-provoking ideas. Some of the funniest and most memorable scenes include faux news reports and commercials with a strong satirical edge, which provides more background on the crazy world RoboCop inhabits. The film breezes through numerous themes regarding capitalism, the mass media, gentrification, and overall dystopia. The film also raises a bunch of pertinent questions regarding technology and its application, especially with a strong man-vs-machine theme at work. Alex Murphy proves definitively that law enforcement can't be fully automated; an officer needs human compassion and free-will. No matter how hard the enemies try to destroy all that makes Murphy human, he triumphs every time, over the machine of society and the machine within him. This film features some crazy and intense photography, the likes of which only Paul Verhoeven can direct. The shots are often tight, with some scenes that use wild and unusual angles. There are a number of point-of-view shots, which are ingenious. Camera movements are solid and smooth. Editing is decent. Acting is over-the-top and exaggerated, for fantastic effect; Peter Weller and Nancy Allen are pretty earnest and great to watch, while Kurtwood Smith, Ronny Cox, and Miguel Ferrer all excel at being bad guys we love to hate. Writing is concise and sharp, and there are quite a few good, memorable lines. This production uses some cheap and outdated props and sets, but the architecture and technology is often used to create a unique post-modern look and style. Costumes are great, and the special effects hold up well. Music is pretty catchy too. RoboCop is one of those films that feels longer than it is, because within the confines of its simple and fundamental story, it crafts a dense storytelling experience that's full of energy as it is full of ideas. Best of all, it's a film with some serious guts: a piece of pulp sci-fi the likes of which you probably won't find too often in Hollywood anymore. Over the film's home video history, there has been both the original R-rated cut and the unrated director's cut available. Really, it only amounts to 30 seconds of additional footage (mostly violence). Recommended for mature audiences. 5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)" "Add another review" "Find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your Watchlist and rate your favorite movies and TV shows on your phone or tablet!")("Movies, TV & Showtimes" "Celebs, Events & Photos" "News & Community" "Watchlist" "" "Find industry contacts & talent representation" "Manage your photos, credits, & more" "Showcase yourself on IMDb & Amazon" "Sign in with Facebook Other Sign in options" "Own the rights?" "As a fan of science fiction movies and also action movies and police movies I obviously loved Robocop. What I loved most of all about it was that it did not hold back any punches as far as all of the violence was concerned. There are some pretty intense scenes especially in the unrated version so you probably would not want kids to be watching this movie even though the language for the most part is not too bad at least from how I remember it. But also there is a lot of really funny comical moments in the movie that we really enjoyed. I just watched it again because I want to see the reboot version of Robocop I just really hope that they don't ruin it!" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Detroit is ridden with corruption and crime, ran by a company. Officer Murphy and Officer Lewis go about their daily routines when it all goes horribly wrong during an arrest attempt of the nefarious Clarence Boddicker. Officer Lewis is compromised and unable to try to help Murphy, leading to Murphy's violent death. Murphy is reassembled into a cyborg. The experiment is a huge success, until Murphy starts having visions of his past life. Murphy goes on a mission with Officer Lewis to rid Detroit of all evil and more importantly, get revenge Paul Verhoeven made two terrific Sci-Fi films: Total Recall & Robocop. They simply don't make them like this anymore. Spare me the so-called \"remake\" I'm willing to give it a chance, but I have a bad feeling it will suck. We don't need a remake! This one is pretty daring for the time it was made. When I was younger, I was absolutely appalled with Murphy's death. It really upset me to the point where I almost cried. It doesn't do that these days, although it is still a bit disturbing to watch. I wouldn't say the script is exactly top-notch. It actually comes across as somewhat cheesy at times, but Verhoeven has such a grasp on the entertainment that it ends up being an unforgettable action ride. The effects are definitely dated. There is a robot in this movie (Ed- 209) that comes across as incredibly corny with how weak it looks. If you're a fan of violence, dig in! It is time for the signature Verhoeven violence. We get a cornucopia of bloody gunshot wounds, impailings, someone explodes in half when hit by a car, and someone's arm is shot off. We also get a spike in the neck. The acting is solid. Peter Weller is appropriately shy and subtle as Murphy while firing off some great lines as Robocop. The man took what could have been a one-dimensional part and made it into his own. I just wish more background on his family was revealed. Those scenes were riveting. I felt Murphy's pain. Nancy Allen is slightly awkward in her role. She seemed a bit unsure on what to do but she's still oddly charming. Her chemistry with Weller was great as well. Ronny Cox is absolutely terrific as a villain and Kurtwood Smith is his match as the other villain. Kurtwood is clearly having a blast in his role. He turns it up a few notches in this one. Miguel Ferrer is wonderfully slimy in his role and chewed up the scenery. This man can do no wrong in my eyes. Even Ray Wise has a role in this one. Final Thoughts: Robocop was so influential at one point, a wrestling company known as WCW (World Championship Wrestling) had Robocop appear on a PPV. It didn't work out very well, but that doesn't matter. As far as entertainment is concerned, it doesn't get much better than this for action movies. This comes highly recommended, creep! 9/10" "In a desensitized near-future overrun with corruption, police officer Weller is brutally murdered by a gang of criminals and is revived as a superhuman cyborg. Spot on when initially released. Weller's miming is well executed and much of the SFX still holds up. The stop-motion of the droid in the boardroom scene dates very poorly, but the tragic event within the scene is as chilling as ever. Even though the film achieves at having an assortment of very heartless bad guys, their deeds still seem a bit inexplicable and over-the-top even for the bleak world the story is set in. Some of the character-arcs are a bit bumpy and the ending seems slightly rushed. Criticism aside, ROBOCOP is one of the few sci-fi action films of the '80s that has withstood the test of time. *** (out of four)" "Brilliant sci-fi movie, well-thought and fantastic from various perspectives. The movie makes a point at different levels. At the physical level by being a plain revenge-drama. At the social level of making a case of where to draw the line of privatisation and automation. At the metaphysical level of longetivity of the subconscious, even beyond physical death. The sarcasms on our daily double-standards are hilarious and in a way, ahead of it's time! In a sense, the director took a risk by creating a soul, but succeeded by elevating, what would otherwise have been a plain-jane action movie." "I first saw Robocop when I was 5 years old...yes I was only 5. I've got my grandparents to thank for that little mistake. I remember being absolutely petrified by it. Walking armoured machines with really sinister voices saying I had 20 seconds to comply, Murphy's disgustingly disturbing death, Robocop's struggle to hold onto his humanity....and THAT scene (which I'll get to in a moment).  22 years later, the remake has been announced with a few impressive names attached to the film and with the first Omnicorp viral doing the rounds I thought it may be time to revisit Detroit's finest. So for the second time in my life, and considering my ever-growing experience watching fantastic pieces of work, was it any good? Hmmm sort of. What I would say immediately is that (believe it or not) Robocop is not really about a cyborg policeman. The film tries to relay a message so much bigger than the future of law enforcement. Paul Verhoeven and Ed Neumeier have gone on record to say as much. To be honest without their conformation the film does blatantly show this. Robocop is an attempt to expose America for what they think it is, money hungry. The film is bathed in images and dialogue which portrays a disgusting country that has lost its sense of pride.  In my opinion, the best parts of the film involved key executives of Omnicorp, the villainous organisation that has its grip firmly on Detroit. The suits are portrayed as the school frat boys of business desperately wanting get ahead of the other in popularity and riches. The famous ED-209 scene in the board room is particularly important to show this. To this day it was still pretty scary to watch and incredibly violent, but what was interesting to see was how dumbed down the reactions were from the members of the board. I don't think this was a case of bad acting or direction, I think this was an intentional  move to show that to us it's a tragic death, to Omnicorp it's a set-back. I was also surprised by its attention to media brainwashing. Showing us news coverage and full screen commercials as if the movie has stopped for a break, suggesting WE need a break to here from their sponsors, like WE need a product fix. The catchphrase \"I'd buy that for a dollar\" is used so much over the course of the film that it becomes  embedded and never goes away. The affect works very well. I've talked quite a lot there about Robocop's intention as a social satire but what about the literal plot that most people remember the film for. Unfortunately in its literal sense, Robocop as a few flaws. Don't get me wrong, Murphy's transition from human to robot is great. The shots are well planned and gripping and Robocop himself looks amazing but it falls pretty flat by the lack of emotion shown by other characters. Murphy's so-called partner Lewis is so wooden that it's hard to believe that in such a short space of time that she has become emotionally involved in Robocop's problems. She is pretty forgettable to be honest. Another real problem with this film is that its action sequences to me are pretty dull.  I honestly don't think they pack any sort of punch to keep anyone interested and unfortunately the soundtrack is awful. Listening to the main theme that has become so iconic over the years made me feel a little embarrassed to the point where it can't really be taken seriously as an 18 certificate action flick. But having said that, Robocop has one of the most disturbing sequences in the history if film involving a vat of acid.  It was a sequence that really disturbed me as a 5 year old boy and the affect has not worn away. It's so relevant to early David Cronenberg body horror images that it feels extremely out of place for a film of this nature. However, this scene alone cannot save Robocop from its bland action moments. So, did I like it? From the many 80's action films that came our way it's definitely the worst I've seen. It tried to take a lot from Terminator and certainly didn't have the grit and horror that James Cameron achieved. On the plus side, Robocop has some really interesting ideas to try and explain where we are as a society and where we are heading. These parts are brilliantly done, I just wish the final product had more meat on the bone so we could watch it for what it is, not for what it was trying to say." "Robocop is by far one of the best sci-fi action movies released in the 1980's. The look of this movie is just astonishing. It has very good visual effects, special effects and there is a lot of violence. This movie is about a police officer who was shot to death by a gang of ruthless criminals and is brought back to life as a half man/half machine named robocop. Hence the films title. Peter Weller was amazing for his role as the lead character. Nancy Allen was outstanding as his partner. In this movie, she is the moral compass. And hands off to Ronny Cox and Kurtwood Smith as the bad guys. This movie is a true classic. It is a must see." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This film is absolutely thrilling on many levels! I always like movies that have cyborgs involved because they do not care about human feelings, they have a program, and their goal is to abide by the program and the rules. This movie has a different twist on that, especially when Robocop starts to remember what happened to him when he was human. This film also has some great villains, and great action involved! The movie has some very violent scenes, so I strongly suggest to get the kids out of the room before watching it because they will more than likely have nightmares especially when one of the villains crashes into a vat of toxic waste! Overall, this movie triumphs as a terrific action film. I think it's message is no matter how much you try to make a man into a machine, you can never terminate someone's mind and emotions! So, give this movie a shot! Long live Robocop!" "This film optimises all the good bits of the 80s. It is ludicrously both violent and funny in places, contains some of the best one liners ever, is set in the future and has a great soundtrack. What more could you ask for! Paul Verhoven was obviously influenced by classics like West World and the film has a really strong good versus evil thread running through it with quite strong religious undertones as well. This is definitely my favourite film of all time and I would highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it. Please bear in mind that there was hardly any CGI used so some of the effects do look a little dated, but that's part of it's charm." "In short, pretty darn well with but a few minor annoyances. For those who never saw it, the name Robocop sounds pretty cheesy but it's nevertheless accurate. It's a mortally wounded normal cop transformed into some kind of cyborg and marketed as the future of law enforcement by a corporation who actually owns the Detroit police. Of course, the corporation wipes out his memories, but the interesting thing is that some start to come back. I found Robocop pretty entertaining and the near future presented here, although not spectacular, shows an interesting satire of society through newscasts and ads. In my memory, there were more ads but the few there are are cynical, darkly humorous and slightly disturbing. Robocop himself is (obviously) rather unemotional but he's cool nevertheless in a deadpan no no-nonsense kinda way. How he deals with each criminal situation is always fun and sometimes surprising. He's slow, methodical, bulletproof and he aims very well. The actions scenes are not frenetic or fast, they're ponderous yet still have impact. The Robocop look is a classic and I don't think it will go out of style. The sound effects and his body movements (especially the head) help sell the mechanical nature of Robocop. I remember this movie having gory disgusting moments and it still has a few, but mostly they're over fast. Anything involving shooting looks painful and it's not glamorized although you'll inwardly cheer whenever Robocop shoots someone because it feels as if they deserve it. That judge-jury-executioner mentality always bugged me in action movies but it bugged me less here. The villains are pretty caricatural but at least they have some personality. The movie tries to make us dislike them, even by showing small despicable acts, and it works. I weirdly wish we had more of those bad guys today instead of the bland cookie-cutter unemotional ones. It's not a movie you watch for the acting as some of it is somewhat over-the-top (looking at you police chief). Yet in the context of this serious satire and since Robocop himself is serious, it blends nicely. Speaking of seriousness, Robocop's actions provide some of the best humour because he's so earnest and clever in his interventions. Despite that, when you think about it, he's a very tragic figure and he has a good character arc. One of the most memorable scenes for me was after his \"accident\" after he's gradually activated, with the cam being Robocop's vision (and us the viewer), intersped with darkness intervals. Two very good echoing memorable scenes are him being shot as a human by criminals (very brutal) and him as a cyborg being shot by law enforcement (nasty and unfair). It makes you fear for him. So, it's been mostly praise up to now but there are a few other things that annoyed me. I liked how the flashbacks were shown but emotionally wise, they didn't grab me as they should have, especially the ones with the kid. I liked how the robot alternative (ED-209) to Robocop looked and it was sometimes quite menacing but it moved too much like stop-motion model animation to me or as part of a miniature set. It looked great at the time but that part didn't age so well. There was also something near the end, that I cannot describe for fear of spoilers, involving a rod that didn't make sense, cheapening the drama. I could guess an explanation but none was offered here either before or after. I think Robocop aged very well. He still looks decent, the humour still amuses, you root for the hero, you hate the bad guys and the story holds up with its twists. Action-wise, I think Robocop's \"slowness\" is an asset rather than a detriment. It makes the action clear and you can anticipate what's coming, making things more satisfying (but still surprising sometimes). Rating: 8 out of 10 (very good)" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Five narrative conflicts in one movie; Man vs. Self, Man vs. Man, Man Vs. Society, Man Vs. Technology, Man Vs. Fate. All in one movie. I am biased to be sure, but RoboCop, is a dramatic movie about grief and loss wrapped up in a shoddy plastic case with flaking gray paint. I watched this the other night again, and even with the ultra violence, the thing that I noticed was how the man became a man, then became a fusion of the two emotionally after he became the machine. Certain things are off in the movie; Murphy's kid is cast too old to properly sympathize with (an 8-10 year old would have been better)and the demographics of Detroit are all wrong, but this is negated by the overall effect. Like the scene where we do not see the steel mill tracheotomy, but the execution of it implies exactly the shock of it, a tight story with great casting, the right rhythm, and the right direction for it's time and place. An extraordinary film; and here are the conflicts; Man vs. Self; Murphy must come to terms with his new self, his reawakened emotions and his inability to go back to the life he once knew. A movie where a man mourns and avenges his own death? Genius. Man vs. Man; Murphy/Robocop vs. Bodiker and Dick Jones, a truly believable duo of villains. Man vs. Society; Robocop loved and hated, an abomination, a Frankenstein, respected and feared but not loved, not human. Can also be Robocop vs. the filth of the city and the corruption of OCP. Man vs. Technology; Now a mechanical man, Robocop fights not only against his new self, but the ED 209s (a wonderful nemesis in it's own right). 'You might not like what you're going to see.' Man vs. Fate; His mission complete, with Clarence Bodiker and Dick Jones taken care of, Robocop becomes resigned to his new role, his new duty, his new self. Love this movie."

"In a dystopian near-future, Police Officer Alex J. Murphy (Peter Weller) is transferred to a rough precinct in downtown Detroit, where he is teamed with tough female cop Anne Lewis (the lovely Nancy Allen). On their first job together, Murphy is gunned down by a vicious gang of criminals, but is rebuilt by corrupt corporate giant OCP who put him back on the streets as RoboCoppart man, part machine, all cop! As a huge fan of Judge Dredd, 2000AD comic's tough lawman of the future, RoboCop was like a dream come true for me when he first came stomping onto the silver screen in 1987. The emotionless lawman wearing a menacing helmet leaving only the lower part of the face visible; the massive handgun; the power of judge, jury and executioner; the use of snappy one-liners ('Your move, Creep': a Dredd-ism if ever there was one): this was Dredd in all but name (only with the benefit of heavy-duty armour plating and a computer for a brain!). Whether script-writer Ed Neumeier and director Paul Verhoeven deliberately channelled the spirit of Judge Dredd into their movie I cannot say for sure, but they certainly captured the essence of the long running comic stripfull of brilliantly realised ultra-violence, satirical swipes at the privatisation of public services, corporate greed and the media, and cool special effects, this is the Dredd film that Sylvester Stallone's debacle never was. Given the choice between the official movie version of the character and RoboCop, I would go with the latter every time. Verhoeven's handling of Neumeier's wonderful script is spot onbrutal, yet touching and wittyand his excellent cast couldn't be better: thanks to training from a mime artist, Peter Weller is utterly convincing as a man turned machine, but also brings a much-needed sense of pathos to his character; the always reliable Allen gives solid support as his spunky partner; Ronny Cox and Kurtwood Smith impress as the film's utterly despicable main bad guys; even the lesser roles are perfect, from ER's Paul McCrane as henchman Emil right down to the guy who would 'buy that for a dollar'! Add snappy editing, a rousing score by Basil Poledouris which helps drive the action forward, plenty of quotable dialogue, and lots of graphic splatter (Verhoeven doesn't hold back on the gore), and what you have is one of the greatest sci-fi/action films of all time. Quite simply, everything about RoboCop works beautifully, like a well oiled piece of precision machinery." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Too bad RoboCop isn't more appreciated. It's really one of the best science-fiction films ever. It could have been just another silly Hollywood product, but in Dutch director Paul Verhoeven's hands it became a thought-provoking and well-crafted critique of American business and culture. OCP (Omni Consumer Products) represents the power of American capitalism. It's a company so wealthy and so powerful that it can reconstruct the entire downtown of the city of Detroit and create a million new jobs. Its two recent products, ED-209 and RoboCop, were made to enforce its plans. ED-209 is a hulk of a robot that can go out of control and kill without consideration. It represents the dark side of American capitalism. RoboCop is a modern knight in shining armour. He's a cyborg who can think, feel and go after the real criminals. He was built by OCP but, because he was the righteous police officer Alex Murphy before, he goes against his creators. In a way, the film is a modern Robin Hood story. Murphy represents Robin Hood while Richard \"Dick\" Jones is Prince John and Clarence Boddicker is the High Sheriff of Nottingham. Jones is the ideal 1980s American businessman. He's aggressive, corrupt, and very much profit-oriented. Robert \"Bob\" Morton on the other hand is younger, a bit wild, and with new ideas. RoboCop is Morton's creation. The cyborg looks fantastic. Peter Weller plays him very well. Just the way he moves is striking. Nancy Allen plays Murphy's pretty partner, officer Anne Lewis. The two remain close even after Murphy becomes RoboCop. The supporting cast is obviously good too, especially the criminals. The four of them are quite the characters. Still, Boddicker easily stands out (Kurtwood Smith wore glasses so that he'd look more like Heinrich Himmler). All the action in the film, though sometimes bloody, is amazing. The music score is another big attraction, fitting the film like a glove. There's plenty of clever humour and corporate criticism. The film's Detroit looks like a futuristic city but also like a decaying one, with crime and poor neighbourhoods. Some reviewers said that the film promotes fascism. The filmmakers denied this, however. In reality RoboCop has socialist messages. There's a lot to like about the film. It's entertaining and it rewards repeat viewings. Director Ken Russell called it the best science-fiction film since Metropolis (1927). RoboCop gets a high recommendation from me." "A cop is brutally murdered in the line of duty only to be resurrected as a robot cop. With a mission to clean up Detroit stopping criminals and corruption unwitting Robocop meets his killers. Social commentary, religious connotations and cutting satire, Paul Verhoeven's Robocop is now over 20 years old, some of the effects have dated and some of the acting is like two-day-old chicken, but it holds up. It is indeed an often-imitated sci-fi classic. It could have been just another Terminator rip-off but all it shared was a machine theme as it had a whole world of its own. That said, it borrows heavily from lesser known films Jean-Claude Lord's The Vindicator and The Wraith both made a year prior. Amongst the rival robot ED-209 and TV commercials what's more interesting about Robocop (played by the now elusive Peter Weller) is the loss of his family and how they have moved on after Alex Murphy's gory death which is only partly explored. There's a lot going on in Edward Neumeier & Michael Miner writing underneath all the action pieces. Miguel Ferrer as 'Bob' is excellent, his performance has all the 80's Wall Street feel of the time, doing whatever it takes to get to the top. Ronny Cox plays 'Dick' Jones and gives the bad guy dimension. It shows a corporate structure and how they also use the underworld to get an immoral job done, in this case using Clarence and his gang played terrifically by Kurtwood Smith. Basil Poledouris' music is fantastic and heightens the films punches and subtleties, the action is great as to are the costumes and practical effects. It is a comic book film for adults but is unusually grounded in a surreal plausibility. It's Orion Pictures fine production, part man, part machine. All cop." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "With its direct-to-video-ready title and decidedly B-movie caliber plot, Robocop really shouldn't be as fantastic as it is. But, by elevating the explosive action sequences with a rather interesting study of science's inability to remove the soul from a human being and some deft satire, this film has actually aged far better than most of its contemporaries. I'm sure most people aren't looking for all that hocus pocus in a film that is more readily billed as a straight, adrenaline-charged action vehicle, so it of course helps that Robocop lives up to the qualifications of this classification with admirable and awesome ease. There are several action set-pieces in this film, most notably the drug lab shootout and the brilliantly realized finale, that live on as scenes that can be watched again and again without losing any of their gravitas. As silly as the idea of Peter Weller stomping out baddies in an intricate metal suit may sound on paper, the seriousness with which the film handles the character of Robocop ensures that we get engrossed enough in his quest for justice that we forget about the logistics of the clunky costume and simply accept it as a feasible creation in the world Paul Verhoeven crafts around it. As an added bonus, the splatter elements are so far beyond anything that had been seen in a mainstream action picture at the time (trust me, I was there), that the violence functions as both over-the-top thrills and as a potent set-up for Robocop's eventual revenge mission. You can't help but feel for poor Murphy when he meets his fate in an early sequence that set a new standard for brutality. On this front, fans of the crimson sauce will be well-advised to seek out the Criterion Collection DVD, which reinstates some cut gore that adds even more weight (as if it were needed) to Murphy's brutal execution, and lets us get a longer glimpse of the firepower of ED-209 as he shreds a hapless executive to ribbons. Weller is very strong in the title role, despite the mechanical nature of his character, and the human element is never too far removed from the robotic creation he has become. The cast is augmented by a slew of brilliant character actors, all of whom you will immediately recognize from several prominent films and television shows. An especially strong turn by Nancy Allen, who is a lot of fun to watch as she holds her own with the high-caliber actors and firepower around her, makes me wonder why I can't readily remember seeing her in ANY other movies (it's also telling that she doesn't even have a picture on her IMDb listing). Allen doesn't strike the viewer as a leading lady, but her nimble handling of material that could be ridiculous in the wrong hands makes it quite amazing that she didn't go on to equally prominent roles. The humor elements are well-restrained and brought in to serve the film, not dominate it. Our titular law enforcement titan doesn't crack a one-liner every time he shoots a bad guy, which was refreshing in 1987, and still is today. Even if we get to laugh a bit throughout, none of the jokes derail the forward momentum of the action, and certainly the grim violence offsets any hint of this film being a camp movie. Though not quite a masterpiece, Robocop has all the elements of a great action movie, and plenty more elements that most genre films of the era didn't have the intelligence to ponder. It's hard to imagine anyone who knows what this film is being disappointed. Highly recommended." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This excellent action, thriller fits into a category or genre that I have dubbed Comic Book Films. In these films the action is tense and furious, the death count unusually high and a little imagination is required of the viewer. RoboCop is even more as it has a high level of satire to spice things up. Paul Verhoeven is one the originators of this genre and one its finest directors. He keeps the pace really moving, adds touches of humor in just the right spots, and he gets the best out of his casts and crews. RoboCop is the perfect example. Peter Weller is perfection as Alex Murphy / RoboCop, giving heart and character to a robot/cyborg and proving he's up to the action as well. Nancy Allen is excellent as his compassionate partner, Officer Anne Lewis. The film has a trio of great villains led by Kurtwood Smith at his nastiest, vilest best, Miguel Ferrer as the sleazy creator of RoboCop, and Ronny Cox as a creepy, despicable CEO of OCP. Dan O'Herlihy adds class as \"The Old Man\". The score, by the great Basil Poledouris, is fabulous and complements the movie. I highly recommend \"RoboCop\" to anyone who enjoys a terrific action film!" "Satire, Comedy, 'over-the-top' violence and emotion is executed with perfection in this movie. 'RoboCop' is the story of police officer; Alex Murphy, who is brutally massacred by a vicious group of criminals. Murphy is then chosen to be the subject of the \"RoboCop project\" prototype, which is an operation that assembles dead policemen into cyborgs. A part-man, part-machine incarnation of Murphy, now called; RoboCop, rides through the old streets of Detroit, fighting crime as a robot police man. RoboCop slowly finds out what happened to Alex Murphy and learns that he was Murphy before his reincarnation as a Cyborg. RoboCop then sets out to get revenge for himself by going after the killers. I first watched this film when I was 7, and I became a 'Robo-fan' instantly after seeing it. To me it was a bad-ass film about a Robot-police man kicking ass in the most vicious way however, when I watch it now, it is more than that. It is a powerful picture about humanity and all its values. The action scenes are incredible and the reflection of 1980's America is done disturbingly well by director; Paul Verhoeven (A legend of his time). I give it 10 stars. Thank You for reading." "Sharp, biting, relentless and over-the-top. I dig it! Paul Verhoeven's high-tech Sci-fi masterpiece 'Robocop' truly stands the test of time, and I don't see it falling from its pedestal anytime soon. Exceptional film-making, and the pride shows in the finished product. Verhoeven' slick and sleek tailoring blends superbly with Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner's furiously lethal, but smartly witty material. You got to have memorable villains, and 'Robocop is no exception. Ronny Cox (corrupt corporate power) and Kurtwood Smith (maniac criminal) are brilliant in their roles, and they're matched up by Peter Weller's perfectly humane performance as Robocop. He emotionally engages. Miguel Ferrer's turn has a lively sting as the man behind the creation and Ray Wise is good. However Nancy Allen is rather ho-hum, acceptable but nothing that stands out really she's bland. The characters are very well-drawn up. Now the special effects. Outstanding and inspired! This is what I miss, and the execution is barnstorming. The stop-motion ED209 design looks great and the metallic creation RoboCop himself is magnetically achieved with the clash between the two being heart-racing experience. As for the action, it comes in spades. Verhoeven drills in the scorching suspense and punishing violence with ease, and this heavy-handed style works due to its gusty premise. Basil Poledouris' score pounds away, but manages a majestic vibe that simply soars. Satire, violence and profanity done in an unapologetic manner by being swirled in to a wicked sense of dark humour and unstoppable energy. Imaginative, powerful and evocative entertainment." "Officer Murphy arises from the dead as a robotic cop who is about to kick some criminal butt... It sounds pretty corny, and it is pretty corny, but it's a pretty great ride while it lasts. As soon as you see the special effects, you know you're in an 80s movie, but that's what makes this so lovable. The action is a little cheesy at times and some of the lines are pretty lame, but if you decide to watch this movie because you want to see the Ironman of 20 years ago, you've made a mistake. This movie knows what it is and doesn't try to be anything more. It has some pretty entertaining fight scenes and the whole concept of a robotic cop is pretty much all this needs. Sure, if this movie was made in 2008 it would be a bit pathetic, but as 80s action goes, this is pretty great." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "I must have been about eleven when i first saw Robocop, the version i had seen on TV was so extremely censored that i was asking myself: why did he die? The damage done to him, didn't looked that serious. As a child, i liked the movie mainly for the effects and robots, but the more i grew up, the more my perception of this movie widened itself and yet there was a shock to come. About ten years later i bought the criterion DVD of Robocop and still i knew nothing, also i had seen Starship Troopers and knew as well as had seen about Verhovens, let's say addiction to movie violence and extreme gore, but still... \"Nana nanana, nana nanana!\" Boom! And off Murphys hand flew, i felt like someone had kicked me in the stomach with full throttle, i truly felt like witnessing an accident or violent crime. I will not give away the full horror of Murphys death, but i have to say, i am not a wuss when it comes to movie violence, but this scene repeated itself in my head as well as willing and unwilling for the next two weeks! The unedited scene with Kinney in the boardroom was already quite unsettling, but you still could laugh, well it was a sick but yet still desperate laugh, there was still something funny about it, but when it came to the full Monty in this scene, oh boy! I couldn't believe that they where laughing at him and making jokes, so sick and depraved, it is hard to believe, but sometimes humans can be so cruel to each other, you just have to watch the news to find out, that this is sadly but quite common, in one form or the other. But if you really keep your focus on the story, you can experience something wonderful, despite all the vile and cruel images. This movie is so much: Satire, Comedy, Science-Fiction, even Horror! But most important it is a great drama! Most people i know, have never seen the original Robocop, they only saw the sequels or the TV shows, or they just oversaw the movie, as what it is. I more or less forced some of my friends to watch Robocop in it's unedited form and all of them where more or less shocked about Murphys death scene, but all told me in the end how wrong they where prejudging or misunderstanding the movie and they all said, that this is a great classic and unsettling drama. It is disguised though, but if you strip Robocop of all the robots and cyborgs, all the guns and drugs, all the corporative slime-bags and thugs, what you then have is a drama and a great one too! It is about the loss of identity, about the value of life, it shows how fragile we are and that we can die any second and that all we take for granted can vanish in an instant! As Verhoven mentioned himself Robocop is about the paradise lost, something you remember, but never can return to. I restrain my self now, because there is so much more to say about this movie, some things probably said, but if you want to see a great action film, a right in your face satire, if you like robots and cool old school stop-motion, if you like extreme bloody violence and if you have a strong stomach, then i only can recommend Robocop! I could write more about this movie, as many others did and could, but you really should see it for your self! Ignore the flaws of this classic and focus on what is important: The drama of Alex J. Murphy!!! And you will see and this is guaranteed a fantastic movie!!!" "Because there is not only a lot of humor in RoboCop, but a lot of hilarious, off-the-wall, goofy black humor extracted from the idea of a ruthless, callous dystopian future in a movie that gives the impression of a grim action thriller, it plunks us out of auto-pilot. We're not entirely certain where the film is going, and that's one of any movie's greatest features. It is Detroit in the future, where violent crime is unmanageable, perhaps because the city is in an economic shambles. The city hires the ubercorporation OCP to sponsor and control the police department, but OCP is not concerned with replenishing the city but instead changing it to an up-to-the-minute utopia. So, they intend to end crime in the city with an already inundated police department. Ronny Cox, the second highest echelon in the conglomerate, introduces a new cop robot called ED-209, which should end the crime in the city. An unrehearsed presentation goes wrong when ED-209 doesn't see that a volunteer has dropped his gun as commanded and unloads on him. A cocky lower employee played by Miguel Ferrer propositions the RoboCop program. Peter Weller plays Murphy, a cop newly transfered to another precinct, soon fatally wounded, to say the very very very least, in action by a vicious gang of villains led by a notorious mastermind played fantastically by Kurtwood Smith, and pronounced dead in the hospital. His brain and face, however, (I can hear you laughing) are used for a robot and he becomes RoboCop, patrolling the city with an extremely effective brand of crimefighting. The rough skeleton of the scenario grows by the side of relatively customary action- adventure outline. But this is not a customary action adventure. Paul Verhoeven, the exceptional Dutch filmmaker is never clearly pigeonholed. There is broad comedy in this movie, and a sure quantity of philosophy, resting on the ponderance of what necessitates a human being. One of those pop culture philosophy books should be written about the RoboCop character and universe, definitely. And there is sharp satire, too. Taking into account that he spends most of his on-screen time behind makeup devices or RoboCop's alloy cowl and visor, Peter Weller is clever in his manner of emoting through stoicism. Nancy Allen is great, and not just a token sexy lady role, Ronny Cox is a great villain, so hateful, and the film's music score is actually quite infectiously memorable. This is one of my guilty favorites."

"RoboCop is a rather classic yet kind of underrated Sci-Fi/Action gem of the 1980's. The film offered plenty of violence, satire and action and the film definitely delivered all three elements. The story is simple, a police officer gets killed in the line of duty by a crime gang but is resurrected as a Half-Man, Half-Machine officer nicknamed RoboCop. Of course, there's more to that story than it sounds. Sure, it sounds cheesy but believe me, it's more than that. Aside from the satire, the film also shows his distraught and sadness over the loss of his humanity and the loss of his family. The acting is great. Nobody could play Alex Murphy/RoboCop better than Peter Weller, he was born to play the character. Nanyc Allen played her role well, Ronny Cox and Kurtwood Smith played really great assholes and their characters also became one of my all time favorite villains. There's a lot of gore in the unrated cut to please fellow gore fiends like myself. The script is really good and Paul Verhoeven handled his direction of the film like a champ, it is that good. Barely any nitpicks. Overall, 10 out of 10 from me." "We are all screwed... well, if you live in Detroit you are. I saw Robocop in the theaters as a 10 year old kid and watched adults leave in disgust and shock while a married couple argued because she wanted to leave and he didn't by the film's halfway point. Awesome! As an adult, I've come to see the lines that separate genres of film internally. Sci-Fi is vast, many of the stories being in the future (Star Trek/Bladerunner) or futuristic (Star Wars/Last Starfighter)... then there is the 'UltraViolent' segment (see Clockwork Orange/Mad Max). RoboCop blurred the lines between most if just slightly. Easily one of Verhoven's best works this film was a huge surprise hit. Not starring anyone in particular but great turns by Weller and Kurtwood Smith it hit home like a grenade you stare at but are too afraid to run from before it kills you. The film, laced with social messages and glaring examples of yesterday's, today's and what were in deed tomorrow's problems did so with gusto and humor while giving you an example of Frankenstien's wet dream in modern technology. Upfront, in your face and riding the wave of Reaganomics, escalating drugs and domestic urban violence the film slaps you with all the sad truths of society with a slightly angry but honest view. If you can see the unrated version, do so. After all, does some extra bullets and blood and guts and brain matter really get offensive at this point? Not just a violent disturbing Sci-Fi film, one of the most surprising social conscience films you'll find. Sci-Fi epic... no bathroom breaks!" "With \"RoboCop\" director Paul Verhoeven and writers Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner brought one of the most memorable sci-fi characters of movie history to the big screen. Three years after the first \"Terminator\"-movie they created another cyborg to behold and although nerdy fanboys have often compared the two and computer games have been made where one battles the other, \"RoboCop\" is an entirely different beast than James Cameron's action/adventure. First and foremost Verhoeven's movie is a satire. A satire on themedia and the American way of life in the 80's during the Regan era. The violence in this film is so over the top it can hardly be taken serious. The news snippets that are strewn in between are little comedic sketches. I remember watching \"RoboCop\" as a child and not getting any of this. To me it was just a badass character at the time. And, of course, the movie still works that way, too. The set design is just awesome. Detroit looks run down and rotten. Every scenery is drenched in gray. That doesn't make the movie a downer, though. It just underlines the fact that law and order doesn't play a major role in this Detroit of the not too distant future. The clumsy (then: state-of-the-art) stop motion-special effects are charming and make one of RoboCop's opponents, the evil (or rather disturbed) robot ED-209 seem much more threatening than any modern CGI would. Finally, I have to mention the violence again. I don't think a big budget movie has gotten down to the nitty-gritty before or ever since. Verhoeven is just mad and one the loose. It's a delight. Not even the spectacular (in terms of body count and f/x) sequel could keep up with the bloodshed of its predecessor. \"RoboCop\" really grows on you, and if it may seem a bit dowdy through the cynical eyes of a grown up living in the 21st century, watch the movie again. And again. And again. Then you will start to feel like a child again watching this for the first time. You will fall in love with scenes like the classic Toxic Waste-incident or the classic \"Dick, you're fired!\"-moment. They just don't make balls to the wall-action movies like this one anymore. Bet'cha that the planned remake of \"RoboCop\" will not better this near masterpiece in any way." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Robocop is essentially two very important genres. In one aspect Robocop is superhero film for adults...a big R rating slapped on it. But it fits the genre. It shows the tragic event that creates the hero, it shows the hero busting random crime, and it shows the rise of a villain to face the hero. The cool thing about Robocop being a superhero film is that it was an original idea and not based on a comic book hero or already established story. Secondly Robocop is a prime example of the eighties action genre which is such an important genre that spawned Die Hard, Rambo, Terminator and every Schwarzenegger film made in his early career. Notoriously R Rated explode fests, blood soaked, four letter words ever and usually token nude scenes from big breasted ladies. Granted Robocop doesn't have any nude scenes remarkably but everything else it hits the mark on in a big way. But Robocop goes beyond both of these genres to really create something incredible that has kept the series going, bad or good in one way or another, for the last 2 decades. Creator and writer Edward Neumeier created this darkly comedic spoof on a future world complete with very tongue in cheek commercials and news reports that make you laugh and think at the same time. It doesn't take away from the film but yet gives the movie a certain edge. Despite seemingly being a last choice for the role Peter Weller turns in a very good performance. He carries the film just as well as any big name eighties actor could have done. Granted most of his acting is from inside the massive suit but that's even more of a challenge because he has to play droning and robotic but still have this emotional side that makes Robocop more than just an action flick and Weller definitely delivers in the role. Nancy Allen is terrific but I think very underused as Murphy's/Robocop's partner. She has this laid back quality to her character and yet she is honest and a strong female partner to Robocop. Ronny Cox is also terrific as Dick Jones, the corrupted senior partner in OCP, the company determined to take over the city any means necessary. Cox is the perfect adversary to Robocop and is the quintessential eighties villain. Miguel Ferrer is also great in a small role as the slimy Bob Morton who created Robocop to undermine Jones' ideas to take over the city. Finally Kurtwood Smith (yep Red Forman himself) is the insanely evil and unbalanced Clarence Boddicker. Boddicker is one of my favorite movie villains because he's completely nuts and the perfect bad guy. I would have loved to have seen him come back in future sequels. In many ways, and maybe it's because the current state of CGI and special effects but Robocop can seem very cheesy and yet at the same time the special effects are incredible. The film was nominated for three Academy Awards in editing and sound. Even the dialog and one liners seem campy but you never really notice it because you become so involved in this futuristic, dark, gritty world with this strange hero that you will be fascinated with. Robocop is an ultimate eighties classic no matter what bad rap it got for continuing in a less than stellar fashion. Over the next month or so I'm going to watch and review every piece of live action Robocop (3 movies, TV Series, and the fourth made for TV installment.) All of this is because I am enamored with the original. It's action packed, great performances, and an all around amazing sci-fi, action hero, film. SEE IT NOW!! 9/10" "A great sci-fi actioner, Robocop offers a bleak vision of a dystopian future by fusing together brutal excessive violence and clever social satire, taking a swipe at big-money corporations and incompetent cops. Paul Verhoeven shows that awareness of the growing interest in contemporary technological advancement is the only way to avoid moral and economic collapse in a crime-riddled society. To achieve this urban pacification a cyborg, Robocop, is created to violently dispose of crime and also corruption in near-future Detriot. Verhoeven uses graphic comic-book violence and sadistic scenes of brutal action to startling and sometimes comedic effect (the latter becoming apparent only after several viewings!). It has a great selection of classic action scenes everywhere. From the brutally dark and disturbing mauling of Murphy to the gross-out but funny sequences involving an OCP exec getting completely mullered by the faulty original law-enforcement design ED-209 (\"Somebody wanna call a goddamn paramedic!\") and a gang member falling into a vat of Toxic waste and then with his skin melting off getting decapitated on the front windscreen of a car! Over-the-top, disturbingly violent, hilarious and brilliantly made. 8/10" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Sometimes I think the 1980s is an underrated decade for movies. While it can't boast as many influential films as the early 1970s classics made by young prodigies, or the high-concept, gimmicky, technically superior films of the 90s or 2000s, the 80s can certainly be regarded as 'The Entertainment Decade'. Most movies of the 80s were fun! And ROBOCOP is much more than that. Whatever the message of ROBOCOP is (or not), it is totally entertaining, from beginning to end. At its bare bones, ROBOCOP is a good-versus-evil action drama of cops against criminals. At that level alone, it accomplishes a lot. It has great, gritty, technically executed action scenes w/o a lot of (if any) special effects. In terms of the real cops in this film and the street criminals, there is a clear delineation of good and evil. Cops: good. Criminals: bad. But underneath the surface, as I'm certain has been alluded to ad nauseaum, ROBOCOP, intentionally or unintentionally, is about more than good against evil, at least 'obvious' good (earnest, hard-working cops) against 'obvious' evil (blatant crime). The film is very prophetic. The scenes of news anchors switching between broadcasting technological advancements and violent crimes is eerily similar to what is going on today. Of course, there's the societal theme of the correlation between increasing technology and increased misuse of it, and that while technology advances, people seem to stay stagnant or to even regress in behavior. The biggest prophecy of ROBOCOP is of corporate greed and how corporations have been outsourced to take over things that should be handled by the government (law enforcement in this film). And by taking over, these corporations corrupt the core tenets of these institutions (today it is military) But in taking over these institutions, the corporations don't necessarily corrupt the 'soldier' of the institution, the cop in this film. And with all of that analysis above in what sounds like the description of a boring movie, ROBOCOP is still hugely entertaining. The basic story is that an ordinary, everyday Detroit beat cop Officer Alex Murphy (played by Peter Weller, more on him later) with wife and child, is on duty one day with his partner Officer Anne Lewis (well-played by Nancy Allen) and they try to arrest a bunch of experienced street thugs, but they fail and Murphy is brutally murdered by the thugs, led by Clarence Boddicker (played by Kurtwood Smith in a confident, lean performance). This scene was very brutal for 1987, and still disturbs. Boddicker delivers the fatal shot to Murphy in the head, then the film immediately cuts to a sequence of well-executed scenes of the ensuing months where Murphy is airlifted to the hospital, operated on, and transformed into ROBOCOP. In charge of all of this is corporate exec Bob Morton (played by Miguel Ferrer in the best performance of his career). Morton works for OCP, who have been 'outsourced' to run the Detroit police department. Robocop is Morton's brain-child of the perfect cop who can fight all crime and can't be stopped. And early on, Robocop can't be stopped. We get the obligatory scenes of Robocop fighting various crimes (grocery store robbery, a rape, a kidnapping) and get a taste of his technological (and human) abilities (built-in eye monitor to see from long range, assessing a situation to choose the best course of action, a targeting system to shoot with accuracy). All these scenes tie together nicely and are taut, suspenseful, and even funny. But something happens. Robocop starts to have the memories of his alter-ego Murphy and actually begins to 'think' for himself. He investigates Murphy's past life and finds out that he had wife, child, and was brutally murdered and proceeds to bring down the criminals who killed him. This is where my discussion of Peter Weller's performance comes in. This is not just a guy in a robot suit spouting off lines in a monotone manner. This is a fully convincing performance of a half-man, half-machine with remarkable abilities, but still with human thoughts, emotions, and instincts under the surface. And Weller pulls it off amazingly. There's not a false note in this performance. As Robocop starts to think for himself and bring down the criminals, Morton's boss at OCP Dick Jones (played by Ronny Cox in a totally convincing performance as a corrupt corporate big-wig) conspires with gang leader Boddicker to conversely bring down Morton and Robocop. And it is this sequence of events that makes the viewer begin to see the complexity in all the major villains (Morton is overly ambitious and a jerk, but he isn't lethal like Jones; Boddicker is a sleazy killer thug, but what does this make Jones, who arms Boddicker with the resources to take down Robocop? Jones is vengeful, but Morton forced him into it by disrespecting his position at OCP). Needless to say, it all comes down to a thrilling climax as Robocop, having been battered and bruised by Jones' own Robot 'cop' ED209 (a overly big, clunky, easily-fooled monstrosity), with a big time assist from Officer Lewis, has the big showdown with Boddicker and his gang at a steel mill. These final action scenes are exciting, with virtually no special effects, just lean, mean, clean action, done the old-fashioned way. The film has all the elements that any great action film should have: a sound story, action scenes with mounting tension and great set pieces (a la the gas station scene, my favorite of the film) and great choreography (the warehouse shootout, a beautifully executed scene), solid acting, a witty screenplay, memorable score, and great direction (by Paul Verhoeven, his best work IMHO). So what is ROBOCOP? Action flick? Sci-fi fantasy? Social satire? Prophetic vision of the future? I say all of the above. And you can add to that SHEER ENTERTAINMENT!" "I just watched Robocop for the first and was surprised at how much I liked it. I was really expecting a cheesy 80's flick with nothing else going for it but it's much more than that. I was thoroughly entertained the entire way through because it moves very well. I'm just disappointed that I waited so incredible long to finally see it. The acting is great, I really enjoyed Peter Weller and Nancy Allen and I felt like Weller did a great job of transforming his character into Robocop. The story is interesting and well written with some truly memorable scenes. What stands out most to me is probably the gore and special effects, they truly blew me away. I think this is a new favorite of mine. If you like Sci-fi/Action movies, this one is for you. I can almost guarantee that it will entertain you the entire way through. But seriously, stop reading this and watch it already!" "This movie is really unique in how it is done. It has also stood the test of time. Sure, Terminator movies are more popular, but RoboCop should be as popular, if not more popular than what people think. RoboCop has a more structured storyline to it than that of Terminator. Plus the character design is way cooler. The movie itself has great acting and there are many memorable catch phrases like \"Stay out of trouble\" and \"dead or alive your're coming with me\". The movie shows the plight of Detroit and the rise of crime. Thus, a man is built into a wrecking machine and gets sweet revenge on those who made him into what he is. I hope they revive this franchise someday. It deserves to be revived." "Paul Verhoeven is one of my favorite directors for the matter of how he makes almost all of his films action-packed but also seem like you're just watching T.V. at home. Robocop is no exception in what could easily be considered his action/sci-fi classic. In case you don't know the story here's how it works: an outstanding rookie known as Alex Murphy is brought into a new police department to crackdown on some dealers. Obviously, it doesn't end too well and the dealers capture Murphy and blast him to bits. Somehow, Murphy is rescued with the little life he has hanging on and transforms him into a cyborg that we now know as Robocop, the ultimate crime-fighting figure. The movie is fun to watch with exquisite visual effects for a film done in the eighties. The action is great, the storyline though somewhat cheesy remains entertaining and you only wish that the sequels were half as good." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "On paper, this movie has the appeal of a low budget movie. On screen, this movie just works. Robocop is a very popular science fiction movie that has developed a large fan following. In an unspecified time in the future, a newly transferred police officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is gunned down by a gang of thugs, led by Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith). Around the same time, Omni Consomer Products (OCP), takes control of the Detroit Police Department. A young executive Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer) leads the Robocop project of creating a 24 hour police officer to combat the crime problem in Detroit. While Robocop has been a success, Murphy's old memories surface and Murphy/Robocop seeks revenge against Boddicker and his gang. Robocop is assisted by his ex-partner Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen). At the same time, Robocop also uncovers corruption within OCP. There is a lot of satire and humour in this movie, which relates to real life. This is not just a straightforward sci-fi action movie, this is a very original and intelligent movie. It contains a lot of violence and gore, but this is what makes Robocop popular. It's a shame most of these actors have not gone on to do bigger and better things, particularly Peter Weller. Robocop 2 was good but not great, it seemed to focus on action and sadistic ultra violence, and the humour was lacking. Robocop 3 was largely disappointing and killed the franchise, as it seemed to appeal to younger audiences, making it less violent and completely removing all the foul language. The original Robocop is, and still is, the best movie in the series and as a sci-fi movie. 10/10."

"RoboCop - This is one of my favourite alltime films, and after seeing this last night, remains so. This is what film makers need to be looking at... even though it's a shallow Sci Fi movie, it's got more emotion in the characters (of which is a superb supporting cast)... incredible effects... Rob Bottin designing Robo is up there with Winston for Predator and Giger for Alien... it's that good. The musci by Basil Poulderis is simply perfect and with the set piece in the cocaine factory creates one of the greatest shootouts in cinema history with stunning choreography on Robo. Simply put this is one of not only the greatest bunch of Sci Fi films ever... it's one of THE best films ever. Well done Verhoven! 10/10" "This film to me has not dated -= in fact the frightening thing is that it echoes what is happening now - from news readers smiling about commercials for the 'SUX' and then shooting to the next story about '300 deaths in central America' (pp)... We even have police officers threatening to strike in the u|k at the moment!! But the film is also so quotable and there are very strong performances - esp from Kurtwood smith \"Can you fly bobby!\" The action scenes are spot on and the violent is very violent - which it should be... the other main star of this is Basil poledouris's music - it is fab and drives the films action and emotive scenes!! Rock on robo!!!" "Robocop deserve better audience then it did it was a fun movie , a misunderstood hero . Peter Weller was great as Robocop , the directing was near perfect , settings was fantastic , since everyone is doing make overs as it were , Battlestar Galactica , Star Trek ; anyone listening out there? A new Robocop ? We need more heroes these days . why not a new Robocop ? Peter Jackson would you do it? Everybody was great , the best . in Robocop . Good job ,well done . Rkallao. Why not Dean Cain as Robocop ? He has the built just like Peter Weller did , but Dean is a lot younger then when Peter did it , imagine what Dean Cain could do as Robocop ?" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Brilliant, Robocop changed an audience's view of action/sci-fi films! Even the storyline of Robocop is engaging, the Detroit police force incapable of stemming crime in the city turn to their city sponsors, OCP (Omni Consumer Products)to find a solution. Their solution to revive a dead cop called Murphy and turn him into an unstoppable machine, who serves the public trust and protects the innocent! The action of the film also caught people's attention, even though to some it was too extreme! I didn't think that! Robocop keeps you watching even when you begin to tire of the action scenes of Robocop stopping a criminal, the constant aroma of techno science-fiction never ceases to amaze me and other watchers!" "A lot of compliments can be paid to such a movie. It really follows no genre, and the writers and director made their own rules. This is action packed, humor packed, coolness packed, emotion packed sizzle! It follows several factions. One is Detroit's bankrupt and fading police force who can't even help when one cop, Murphy, is brutally murdered by a second faction, a group of engaging and amusing deliciously evil bad guys who will make you hate them and laugh with them at the same time. A third faction, a super large corporation of bigwig Bill Gates types who run the city, create the new mechanized crime fighter. But there again, we have some outstanding, yet at the same time, hilarious, conflict. There are scenes involving the bloodsucking members of the corporation that are classic. In fact there are classic scenes throughout this movie in every little frame. A man wets his own pants trying to escape a bathroom. A genial kindly old man witnesses a fellow board member being gunned down mercilessly and tells the man responsible \"I am very disappointed.\" There are little commercials and bits which the characters watch on TV that add spice. The language is harsh, but hilarious and needed for this type of movie. In the toned down version, the leader of the bad guys storms into a room and says \"Ladies leave!\" Huh? The original was much more effective. Try to get the uncensored version for the full effect." "Its a dark time in Detroit. Crime overrules the city. Meanwhile, OCP buys the police force and starts experimenting around with robots. Then they create ROBOCOP. Hes indestructible, unstoppable, and furious. Besides being a robot, he starts having flashbacks about his past. Excellent movie, well worth watching. Phil Tippit's amazing ED-209 really makes the movie. Smart script, action and occasional humor spin into one. WARNING: This is an incredibly violent picture. But its still good. Hey! Its got Red from 'That 70's Show' in it, how can you go wrong? Script: 20 (30%) Acting: 35 (40%) Effects: 20(20%) Music: 10 (10%) ----- 85% = 9" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This is an awesome film. The acting is awesome and very believable. I've seen both the unrated and the R rated version of the film and the unrated version is better, in which Alex Murphy's death is more violent (which can be a good thing). Kurtwood Smith, did a fabulous job as Clarence, the crime lord of Detroit. Peter Weller did a fabulous job as Alex Murphy and Robocop, especially when trying to find out who he was before he became Robocop. The special effects are very good, considering the time when this film was made. If you enjoy sci-fi films, action films, or movies with lots of violence, then this movie is for you." "They don't make them like this anymore! A classic of the genre, Robocop is shocking, violent, but an absolutely compelling film. A film like this could never be made in the present-day politically correct environment, and I don't believe that is a good thing. Robocop is a frightening insight into a dystopian future where large corporations run rough shod over society, completely devoid of benevolence, a profit is far more important to them than social cohesion and even human life. Unrealistic? I don't think so, especially not in a country like the USA. Some of the violence is extremely gratuitous, particularly Murphy's murder and the ED209 massacre, but the movie wouldn't be the same without it. That said, I wouldn't recommend this movie for children. The media reporting of Casey Wong I thought was brilliant, as well as the advertisements. Fantastic satire on consumer culture and where we might be headed. Acting was first rate, particularly Dick Jones and Clarence Boddicker, wow, these guys were brilliant. Although the special effects are clearly outdated, particularly with ED209 scenes, this movie has truly stood the test of time. After nearly 20 years Robocop is still far superior to the nonsense action movies put out today which might contain flashy special effects but fail to capture anything like the suspense and power of this film. As stated earlier, truly one of the best of its genre: Brilliant movie, I give it 9 out of 10 stars" "Having seen this movie about 10 years ago it seems that quite a few things about the story have either come true or could possibly come true maybe 10 years down the road. Although not mentioned in this movie (the worst drug imaginable \"nuke\" was prevalent in Robocop 2, there is quite a bit of drug referencing and could be referring to our problems today with \"ice\". This film is extremely violent but it is a foretaste of what life will be like in the near future. It was good to see that there is still a \"human\" element to Robocop. The writer realizes that you still need some compassion and empathy even in technology. If you don't, you might end up with a situation like the one in this trilogy, or worse you could be staring down the barrel of the \"Terminator\" scenario. This movie has some great acting and the company in the movie reminds us of quite a few companies which will remain nameless to avoid lawsuits." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "If you haven't already seen this movie, do yourself a favour. Sit down with an open mind and remember that it's not just another shallow 80's gun-fest, but rather a fantastic deeply funny satire. And while it is very funny, and excessively violent, there is a lot of emotional weight behind it that drives the story forward. Robocop is a great movie that works on so many levels and can be viewed in any number of ways. It's got satire, sci-fi, ultra-violence, rich imagery, great acting, black comedy, heart... I love this film and it's as relevant today as it was back in 87. Peter Weller does a great job and by putting such an actor in the lead role is just one of the many elements that makes this film so much more than violent sci-fi hokum. Paul Verhoeven directs brilliantly. This movie comments on everything from America's love affair with violence and justice, to the danger of society ruled by \"big business\". Robocop really deserves to be ranked alongside the likes of The Terminator and Blade Runner. Not to be missed."

"classic sci fi movie. In my mind, the best sci fi movie there is. It is great on all fronts: acting, directing, storytelling, script, action, pacing. From the news flashes and goofy commercials to the graphic violence and graphic language, this was a head turning cult hit. The real treat here were the bad guys in the movie, they were real sinister and evil. Kurtwood Smith will always be Clairence to me, I don't give a damn if he was in 'That 70s Show' and Ronny Cox was just as good a villain too. RoboCop has some sharp action for its time but it was also emotional on many levels. When Murphy gets killed in the warehouse, it was so violent and butchering that it made you that much more of a fan of RoboCop through the movie as he really just goes and picks off each of the goons that killed him earlier. Some good twist and turns, many story lines through the movie that fell into place very smoothly. It produced 2 other sequels but nothing nearly as good as this one. A real gem. They don't make movies like this anymore, its a real shame." "Although on the surface, a good guys vs bad guys flick, this movie exists at several levels at once. Sci\\fi, comedy, action etc.... However, I believe that this is a story about a man who is on a search for his very being. HAving been reduced to a machine, he spends the entire movie trying to find out who he is. The answer to \" Good shooting son, what's your name?\", is the penultimate moment. This is why Robocop 2 ehhh and rebook 3 yuck, were uneeded. The action flick nature of Robocop is a vehicle for Murphy's rediscovery. Murphy is never intended to be a superhero. Great movie, and an example of where they should have \"left good enough alone\"" "Robocop is an exceptional film, it combines the themes of a comedy, sci-fi, action, and even moments which leave you feeling sorry for characters in the movie, personally i love it how the society in which the movie is based-on is modelled by a corporate domination of both civil rights and public authority, robocop is a kind of 'final-solution' to inhibit the people of this society from plunging into total-anarchy, and the evil-minded yet calm and bipolar corporate bosses are willing to use any magnitude of force to stop an uprising from the people. This film will bring any new viewer extreme excitement, and laughter, it has it's fair share of brutally explicit slaughter scenes, but that's half of the fun." "RoboCop is just about as close as you can get to the perfect sci-fi action movie. With Paul Verhoeven behind it, RoboCop gives us a gritty and depressing look at a violent future. Speaking of violence, this is an ultra-violent film that is not for the squeamish. Blood, guts, and body parts fly in all directions, which is what we've come to expect from Mr. Verhoeven. The action sequences are wonderfully over-the-top. You couldn't ask for any more huge explosions, intense car crashes, or crackling shootouts (all about the shootout at the cocaine factory). Peter Weller is perfect as RoboCop. No one could've played him better. And that's final. Ronny Cox and Kurtwood Smith are excellent as the villains...you just can't wait for them to get stabbed in the neck. The score is one of the most memorable in movie history and you will be humming it for days. The cinematography is top-notch as well. To sum up: great action, great story, great music, GREAT FUN! You go Robo!" "Verhoeven has made an ultra violent movie that plays out before your eyes like a smooth ride. The script tells of a near-future society where violence and power rules and big-government and media has taken over and might even have fused. They need a miracle to stomp out the violence and create order, and to do that they take the body of a slain cop hero and turn him into Robocop. But something remains of the human that used to be Murphy, and as it turns out this element is enough for Robocop to turn against his creators and get to the real roots of the problems. The bad guys have no redeeming qualities and are dispatched off in the worst ways. How does a bath in toxic waste sound like? This movie also has none of the American patriotism and what-not. Paul Verhoeven is a Dutchman, and has no sympathies in any of those directions. It is just an ultra violent near-future version of the world as we know it. This movie is a comedy, but it is not easy to spot it. That is one of the things that makes it so good." "\"RoboCop\" is your average graphic comic book brought to life.The characters act like the kind of characters you may find in a graphic comic book.The setting of the film is urban,futuristic and grim.Set in Detroit,1997,Peter Weller is a cop who is killed in the line of duty and is then transformed in to a crime fighting machine by a corrupt corporation.This film does have its moments in terms of violence and action.\"RoboCop\" is a riot and a lot of fun to watch.This is the best film of 1987.And as I said before,the most violent of 1987. Revenge is told with such glee in this film and the special effects are amazing.The power of \"RoboCop\" not only comes from its violence or visual effects,but from its look of a futuristic detroit.I was 16 when I had seen this film back in 1988 and I was deeply effected by this film.It's not that often that you will come up upon a film like \"RoboCop\"." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "I first watched RoboCop at a very young age. At the time, I loved it, because of the fact that RoboCop was just a cool robot who completely wiped out the bad guys. Now I watch it, and see the other side that makes this such a masterpiece - the satire. The film is basically a mouthpiece for the criticisms of privatisation in the 1980s, and how it would lead to the problems of the future. Many of the news reports and the adverts are done so well, as both a piece of satire and in their creation, that you can't help but commend them. One thing that has horrified many people since the film's release, is the amount of violence in the film. The body count is very high, and the film contains some of the most disturbing scenes in film history - I could never watch killing of Murphy at the start, nor the part where one of the characters is covered in toxic waste. In essence, RoboCop is a film that MUST be seen. The satire, violence, comedy, and unique character of RoboCop make this a film that will last for a long time." "Robocop is, in one persons humble opinion, one of the great underrated films of the 1980's. On it's surface, Robocop looks like a straight action movie, with a slight science fiction bent. But peel back the layers, and you find a biting satire, covering multiple targets, from 1980's corporate and popular culture to action movies themselves. Opening in near future Detroit, we are introduced to the world of Robocop via a fast-paced television news program dubbed \"MediaBreak\" (It's motto \"Give us 3 minutes, we'll give you the world\"). What we see isn't pretty: Terrorists have seized Acapulco, white supremacy government in South Africa has a nuclear weapon (one aspect that dates the film), the Star Wars nuclear program is in full swing, and over 40 police officers in Detroit have been murdered by crime boss Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith). The Detroit police force has recently been privatized and is being run by uber-corporation Omni Consumer Product (OCP), and the recent police deaths has the force threatening a strike. OCP senior vice president Dick Jones (Ronny Cox) is about to introduce a new law enforcement robot, ED-209, but a malfunction during a demonstration of ED-209 gives junior corporate officer Robert Morton (Miguel Ferrer) an opening to pitch his pet project, dubbed Robocop, to the \"Old Man\" (Daniel O'Herlithy). At the same time, in a remote Detroit police precinct, officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) has just been transferred in and quickly finds himself in a bank robbery chase with his new partner Lewis (Nancy Allen). The chase leads to Murphy being captured by the robbers, led by Boddicker, who shoot Murphy down and leave him for dead. But he isn't quite gone. His brain and face are removed and used as the basis for Robocop: a half human, half robot police cyborg, complete with titanium outer skin and onboard computer memory to allow for recording of his activity. Robocop begins cleaning up crime on Detroit's dangerous streets, but an encounter with one of the gang that murdered him awakens memories within Robocop of his previous life, causing distress to his OCP handlers. With its title, and a very sci-fi, comic-style look for it's main character, it might be easy to dismiss Robocop as kids stuff, but the reality is much different. Robocop is a film that earned it's hard-R rating, featuring copious amounts of violence, language and occasional nudity, but it all serves a purpose. The 1980s saw the height of the action movie, with grander and more ridiculous sequences in action films multiplying with each passing year. Robocop is very much a reaction to that, and it's over the top violence is pushed to such extremes that it starts being funny. Screenwriters Ed Neumier and Michael Minor and director Paul Verhoeven push the boundaries of a standard action film in terms of violence and quickly makes other action films look as ridiculous as they really often are. But Robocop doesn't stop there. It comments on the dwindling attention span of television viewers (the brilliant MeidaBreak segments), television advertising (including commercials for a brand of artificial hearts as if they were items in a supermarket) and, most importantly, the explosion of corporate culture and public services falling under private control. Few key social issues that were hot buttons in the 1980's are left unaddressed in this film, and each new issue introduced makes a strong impression. Robocop isn't interested in just providing us with an action tale, it has an underlying message to go along with it. Most importantly, there is no self-aggrandizing or heavy-handed dialog and speeches to accompany this material. Viewers are left to pick up on it themselves. But, that being said, Robocop is actually a more rousing action film than many of it's counterparts that it is ridiculing. Most of Robocop's action scenes are well-produced and exciting, especially later in the film. It also helps that Minor and Neumier don't spare the character development. Robocop is a tragic character, a man who's life is cut short, who is deprived of his human body and most of his past, yet haunted by visions of his previous existence. He cannot truly reconcile the two, and some of the film's strongest scenes are ones in which Robocop revisits his old house only to become enraged by the fact that everything he remembers that was good is gone. On the acting front, there are two key standouts: Peter Weller and Kurtwood Smith. Weller has a tough job, getting us to care about a character that is covered in a giant metal suit and has limited facial expressions. But when the necessary moments arrive, Weller delivers, instilling his character with pathos. He pulls it off often with only a quarter of his face revealed. Smith creates a memorable film villain, his Clarence Boddicker so vicious, rude and vile you can't help but hate him. Prior to his role on That '70s Show, Robocop was Smith's most recognized work, and with good reason. It is unfortunate that time has not been kind to the Robocop character and the franchise in general. Two mediocre sequels, a short-lived television series and a quartet of Canadian-produced TV movies have done to the original film what the multiple Jaws sequels did to Steven Spielberg's initial masterpiece, they diminished it. But, if you strip away all the excess baggage that these other distractions provide, Robocop is still a great film, and one that should be better remembered." "This movie was released in the United States in 1987, but when I first enjoyed it here in Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico it was in the autumn of 1988 and I have never heard of it before, I didn't know why I never see any trailers. so when I watched it completely shocked me and amazed me and so far i have seen it maybe 30 times. All the main actors I have been following their careers very closely, I have been feeling very much appreciation and endearment with them, even the bad guys Kurtwood Smith,Jesse Goins, Ray wise, Paul McCrane Calvin Jung and Ronny Cox. The entire movie was full of emotion and spectacular stuff, pretty fast scenes one after another, the extreme violence hits really hard.Congratulations to Paul Verhoeven for his great science fiction movie, a total masterpiece." "I recently saw this for the first time, and loved it. Well, not exactly the first time I've see it, but the first time I've seen it start to finish. I've tried to watch this dozens of times, and for whatever reason I always get interrupted. Anyway, what an awesome movie! This has everything that a good action movie needs: Kurtwood Smith makes for an awesome villain, plus there's some semi-unexpected plot twists that I found pretty cool. Not to mention the awesome effects for the time. Though I singled out Kurtwood Smith, almost the entire cast does well in their roles. Peter Weller will and has gone down in history for his role as the title character, and well he should have! The ED-209 scene really caught me off guard, and I loved it. Overall, I say if you like action movies and haven't seen this....GO BUY IT NOW!!! I assure you that you wont be disappointed! 9/10" "Add another review" "Find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your Watchlist and rate your favorite movies and TV shows on your phone or tablet!")("Movies, TV & Showtimes" "Celebs, Events & Photos" "News & Community" "Watchlist" "" "Find industry contacts & talent representation" "Manage your photos, credits, & more" "Showcase yourself on IMDb & Amazon" "Sign in with Facebook Other Sign in options" "Own the rights?" "I had never seen this until 2006, I popped it in the DVD player and all of a sudden there was a stop motion machine that didn't look very real but still gave the affect it was aiming to give. Murphy (the man before he became Robocop) was the type of guy that seemed very likable so I felt sorry for him once he had died and was reincarnated in to a mindless robot. I must say that Robocop does have ultra violence but I never get tired of it. Robocop is the type of movie that I would buy and watch a couple of times before I would become bored of it because it so entertaining and never boring. If you have never seen Robocop I strongly advise you to because I promise you that you will not be disappointed. In conclusion, Robocop is very good and entertaining but don't expect out of this world special effects. Robocop can at times be annoying but after a while he grows on you." "I have finally seen this movie, its awesome!! I know I usually have to close an eye or maybe two if it considers special effects in movies from the 80's but this one is definitely not one of them. Good special effects! Very good sound effects too, the walking of robocop is really scary. I loved that scene too when robocop finally comes alive, It remembers me of \"the matrix\" although this movie is much older. The acting is very good, I have seldom seen movies where every villain plays his role well, but here is one! This movie does indeed contain quite some violence, quite some!!! So maybe it was good that I haven't seen it back then in the 80's. It never annoys though. The film keeps tension well reserved and I had the feeling that the movie was longer than the given 100 minutes or so? So my final question remains, why weren't robocop 2 (and maybe 3 too) not directed by paul verhoeven as well? Even today This movie is a masterpiece!!!" "A cop, Murphy, transfers to a new precinct in a bad part of town and is soon killed brutally in the line of duty. Coincidentally a totalitarian company, that owns the Police Dept, is developing a project for a cyborg policeman and Murphy is just intact enough to be revived as Robocop, the city's most effective enforcer of law. However, Robocop first doesn't know about his past as a human, but he soon begins to uncover it, along with plenty of corruption in the city. Verhoeven mayhem ensues. The story gives a nice focus to not only the action scenes, but to a cyborg discovering its former human-self. The common theme of man vs. machine is addressed from an unusual perspective here as the main character is really neither robot, nor human. Other, though equally respectable films, like The Terminator, draw a line in black and white: human is good, machine is bad. This interesting story angle should be enough for fans of science fiction to check watch this movie. The other part of the story is a futuristic satire about just how powerful we should let our big corporations be and just how much we should let them get away with. Robocop is a representation this is his often brutal, albeit effective, methods of dealing with criminals which all go without complaint. Also deserving mention are the special effects. They are top notch considering 1987 restraints for them. Obviously dated by now, but they are quite elaborate and the production did a good job of putting them together with nothing being digital. So, all in all, this is a good watch. 8/10 Rated R: a lot of graphic violence, and profanity" "My absolute favorite movie! #1 I have watched it over 200 times and love it! The 2 main sequels are OK and the others are just awful but the 1st really hits the mark with me. I saw it opening day and since purchased all version on DVD and watch it regularly. I was thrilled when my son wanted to watch it. I think it is on of the most original, brutal and funny movies ever. Oddly, I find myself quoting it often. \"... give that man a hand!\", \"... just give my f~n phone call\", \" I am a repeat offender... I repeat... I will offend again..\" See, I do love this film, everyone should watch it at least once." "Yes, that's right. Best Movie Ever. One of the best sci-fi movies of its own or any other time, ROBOCOP features a plot that, while it does find itself with a few little pot holes and gaps, flows smoothly enough for the true purpose to come through. For the most part, it's more about violence than anything. The plot holds its own to the extent that it does draw into various violent encounters, which in the end, are the entertaining factor of the movie. Amazingly low-budget, no truly big names, with a director who most people have never heard of- it still manages to be my favorite movie of all time. ROBOCOP 2 is just alright, with seemingly vast filler, and ROBOCOP 3 is just an attempt to market new action figures and should be sealed away and burned." "It is set in Detroit, in an unknown but quite near future. Capitalism has went beyond the limits of anyone's imagination. It has touched even the police and space agencies, all of these under control of Omni Consumer Products. OCP for short, it is a firm with HUGE ambitions: it attempts to create new city-- Delta City is the name-- from the ashes of the chaotic and crime-ridden Detroit. After failed attempts of creating a strong police force (loosing about 5 guys every week) or a good enforcement droid (ED-209, a bulky, 10-metres-tall droid kills an executive during testing), Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer), a young scientist and OCP corporate proposes a solution: the creation of a Robocop. He finally gets his candidate when Alex Murphy (Peter Weller), an honest and highly competent police officer gets brutally slaughtered by a sadistic group led by Clarence Boddicker. 40 days later, he is brought back to life as a crime-fighting cyborg. After a series of successful tests, OCP finds its popularity soaring and its position secured. But, after a months, things go somewhat awry as Robocop recalls his human past, and tells him to get revenge on the criminals that killed him... Loud, ultra violent sci-fi cop movie never lets up for a minute. One of the earliest of the cyborg craze that followed the Terminator, this movie stands out from its role model and its countless rip-offs. The story is slick and+ has the right combination of action and humour. the Special effects are eye-popping (with many nominations from various institutions), even by today's standards (ED-209 animation and Robo's first-person view, to name a few) and they make the movie entertaining. Peter Weller endured physical torture of sweating buckets in the costume, and He sure pulls it off: He makes this clunky , bulky machine look and act human, even more than at the first quarter of the movie in which he is ACTUALLY a human being. Despite these advantages, the movie is just a bit too short (99 mins PAL, 103 at NTSC format). There are not enough humane scenes to camouflage the movie's sometimes disturbingly dark and bleak view of the future, and Nancy Allen's performance is not exactly one of her best. But still, it's a lot of fun and it's one of the best sci-fi films of the '80s. *** out of ****" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Somewhere in the near future a cop, Alex Murphy (Peter Weller), gets shot by a punch of sadistic cop killer in his first day in new precinct. Omni Consumer Product, a company that owns the police takes his mortally wounded body and revives him as a mean, lean law-enforcement machine (drumm roll here) RoboCop. The OCP technicians thick they've erased Murphys memory, but soon a friendly face, a female cop Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen) recognizes him and soon they start their chase against the killers of Murphy. RoboCop was, and still is very good action film, despite of the fact, that age is showing through from the special effects, like military/police robot ED-209, which movements can't be even compared to modern day specials. But all this, and the overall comic book like plot, gives the movie its own charming look, making it fun to watch. Well okay, maybe fun is in some places of the film a wrong word, as most of the action scenes are a bit sadistic, Murphys Killing in the beginning, and bloody, every thing else in the action department. RoboCop also has a more satirical element in it, mainly pointed against capitalism: OCP, a company, which owns the police, mock up commercials, etc. As small funny element there's this small criticism towards violence in entertainment, when a family is shown playing a Nuclear War board game. but then again RoboCop IS violent entertainment. But I strongly want to note, that this movie is not meant to the smallest members of your family. I dare to say this movie is action classic." "I remember first seeing 'RoboCop' when I was about 8 or so. I do believe my reaction was: \"Cool! Robots!\". Now as my last months of being a teenager creep up on me, I watch 'RoboCop' and say \"Cool! Robots!\". How little I've changed... In the near future, Detroit is suffering from high crime rates and corruption. The Police force is saved by the private OCP corporation. Naturally, OCP is in the business of building killer robots that resemble miniature versions of the robots in 'Robotech'. Enter Alex Murphy (Peter Weller), a cop new to Detroit who dies nearly as soon as he's introduced. However, when you work for a company in the business of designing killer robots, the chances that you'll be brought back to life as a near-invincible, crime-fighting, super-robot are pretty high, and thus the near-invincible, crime-fighting, super-robot RoboCop is born. For a story about a near-invincible, crime-fighting, super-robot, 'RoboCop' is at least pseudo-intellectual. We given a future, with no definite date, that is slowly creeping up on us. A future that I think we'd all prefer to avoid. However, I learned a much more valuable lesson: robots seek vengeance too. No, I'm not going to be hooked by a warning of a dystopian-future. On the other hand, robots that seek vengeance... Now that's a different story altogether. I can't believe 'RoboCop' didn't leave more of an impression on me when I first saw it. I saw 'Aliens' at the same time, and I was freaked out for a year. Now when I watch 'RoboCop' I'm making my own tally, trying to figure out if the \"Bodycount: 30\" entry on the trivia page is accurate. 'RoboCop' is rather violent. I'm surprised I even managed to see it when I was so young, but I guess that's what kids do: watch awesomely violent action movies. The action scenes are awesomely cool - what more would you expect from a near-invincible, crime-fighting, super-robot? 'RoboCop' is a fine action film. It has some nice story elements for those who would consider it a 'Terminator' rip-off, but I am a devotee of the action genre, and 'RoboCop' is one of the greats - 9/10" "Robocop is a first-rate, first-class, superior sci-fi/action movie classic. This movie can only be described as 'overkill'and that's why we love it. Unrestrained violence, eccentric characters,abusive foul language, an uncompromising setting, these are just some of the ingredients that round off this rare gem of a film. This film was made in the pre-C.G.I era, so that makes the film even more of an accomplishment. Go and buy a copy of \"the directors cut\" of ROBOCOP because everybody should have it in their DVD collection. Unfortunately this film was followed by two defective and substandard sequels. ROBOCOP 2 was a completely inadequate follow-up and ROBOCOP 3 was a weak and fraudulent third chapter. However, the original stands as a true testament to exemplary sci-fi/action cinema." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "When honest cop Murphy is gunned down by gangland villains, he becomes the subject of a new pioneering technique to replace the police with robots. However, the human part of his mind still survives, goes after the villains who shot him and effectively ended his human life. Much more than simply an action film (though Robocop is filled with great action sequences), this is a look into the future of humanity. The de-humanising of the police, who are controlled by OCP, a big corporation who put no value on human life as long as they make money, and aren't above employing cop-killers to swat anyone who irritates them, is a genuinely disturbing thought. The heroes and villains of the film are all strong characters. The scene in which Murphy/Robocop takes his mask off and looks at his battle-scarred face in a reflective surface, accompanied by an atmospheric soundtrack, still sticks in my mind."

"*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "i don't know how i came to like robocop so much but i think it's part of my love for campy sci-fi and bleak futures. this movie is what i consider to be the greatest interpretation of he near future than any other movie. this is beating out a clockwork orange, blade runner and judge dredd. wait, scratch the last one, which sucked. back in 88 it some parts seemed too unreal, but now, those same parts aren't even funny anymore, because they're too real! the robotic heart- now exists. street police with body armor- now exists. the over aggressive businessmen- now exist. and i believe that if there ever was a cyborg cop, he wouldn't be all kool and like the matrix with wires everywhere and all high-tech and dark looking, he would look like robocop, and probably be called something similar if not exactly the same. this movie is smarter and more emotional than would be expected from a movie of it's title, is the classic man vs machine storyline with the twist that it takes place inside one person. as for the sequels, i love the second one. i think it has everything a sequel should, though not as good as the first, gives you a taste of robocop kicking ass. as for the third. ummmm. it might have been good had they gotten peter Weller. if they just put his voice in this movie it would make it twice as good, though suck it does. robocop rules. the main argument against it being \"it's too corny\" to which i say \"yeah, well that's what's real\". or is it? yes it is. isn't it? yes. ? ." "ROBOCOP is a future that is all too believable. With crime rampant and a company running law enforcement ROBOCOP is the hero whose gun never misses. The streets run red with blood as Robocop patrols the slums of Detroit. Robocop is a smart persons action film. ROBOCOP is written with darker than dark humor and moments which explore the half man half robots remaining humanity. One thing ROBOCOP is not is boring. The film has a steady pace which is more than enough to keep those with short attention spans awake. Adding to the believability of the film is the modern look of the surroundings. The only fantasy element in the film are the robots everything else is present day looking. The fantasy in the film never loses focus and never detracts from the film. Some films get drowned in the fantasy and fantasy elements. This one dosen't. I recommend this film but please keep in mind it has graphic violence." "You know at the club scene when Robocop is about to arrest Leon Nash?Right when Leon pulls the gun out of his pocket, Robocop knocks it out of his hand. Some dude with long gray hair catches it. Was that the director?" "Gratuitously violent, a satire of America of the future, a Christ metaphor, a tragic undercurrent over the notion of losing humanity and family and a villain who dies by melting and then being run over by a car. It may not sound like a brilliant film, but it is. Paul Verhoeven's RoboCop is right up there with Cameron's The Terminator in that it is a perfect piece of nostalgic entertainment, a film that is a representation of what was so brilliant about the 80's. Many budding reviewers that write about the film will always touch on the satirical matters of the film, and they are brilliant, especially in their regard to the representation of television, from the manner that the news is delivered to the entertainment that is offered (\"I'd buy that for a dollar\"). But where this film really touches me is in it's story. Paul Verhoeven may be a man of excess (just take a look at the level of violence in the director's cut of the film) but the way he brings across the story of Murphy marks it out as the finest film he has directed. Whereas Basic Instinct, Starship Troopers and The Hollow Man were all to wrapped up in showing us controversial and violent material, here he counterbalanced that philosophy with the emotional undercurrent. When RoboCop starts to learn more of his life when he was Murphy (brilliantly shown when he revisits his previous home) Verhoeven pushes the emotional buttons without dipping into sentimentality. The film has a heart and soul that is very genuine and that really tugs at you. I dare you not to be shouting \"Murphy\" at the end of the film. Of course it is the quality of the production that makes this film so brilliant and the performances. It makes one wonder how Peter Weller never became a bigger star, with his fine work here clearly in abundance. Ronny Cox and Kurtwood Smith are fantastic as the villains, with Smith's Nazi like Clarence Bodicker being a real stand out. Then there is the fantastic make up from Rob Bottin. Everything from the RoboCop suit and the melting effects done of Paul McCrane still standing up today in an era full of CGI. Plus I couldn't do this review without mentioning the fantastic music of Basil Poledouris. No 80's synthesisers here, a wonderful sweeping orchestra that is moving and sad and brings pathos and optimism to a fantastic package. To quote Emil, \"I LIKE IT\"." "Robocop is one of those 8o's action movies that you could watch over and over. I think Peter Weller has that uncanny robot voice and is perfect even though he couldn't act himself out of a paper bag. It is too bad they had to spoil this great action classic with some lousy sequels." "One of the greatest cult classics that has ever come about. This movie is made great by all things in it. Any movie with a ford taurus that has a 350 engine and front wheel drive is great. Robocop is fueled by almost as much great one liners than the king of one liners himself, who we all know to be Arnold. Robocop is a positive roll model for all youngsters growing up in todays society. When Robocop takes out Dick jones, he is showing that he is what is left that is good in society. E.D.-209 can gladly replace my dog any day. If every house had a devoted protector such as E.D.-209 then everyone could sleep at ease. Children could wake early Christmas morning play fetch with E.D.-209. Spouses could enjoy a soothing cup of coffee on the couch in a room lit by the fire place as E.D.-209 sits in defense ready stance on the rug infront of the mantal. E.D.-209 should be sold at pet stores round the world. Of course no one can truly experience Robocop with out getting inside and seeing all of the Robocop saga. You must see Robocop, Robocop 2, Robocop 3, Robocop: Prime Directives, which are Robocop Dark Justice, Robocop Meltdown, Robocop Ressurection, and Robocop Crash and Burn. There should be a Robocop doll by every childs bed that they can cuddle with in the night." "Peter Weller stars as Alex J. Murphy a mortally wounded police officer who is turned into a cyborg policeman, who fights crime in Detroit and decides to take revenge on the sadistic gang that murdered him in this powerful, violent and funny classic. Robocop has to be one of the ultimate superhero movies to date, it contains sharp satire and eye catching actionscenes, plus a first rate script. Peter Weller is extremely sympathetic in the part." "I remember when the trailers for this came out. When the voice-over intoned \"RoboCop- the Future of Law Enforcement!\" Everyone in the theater laughed. What a stupid title! But then it hit the screen and man, was it great! I bought it on DVD a while back and it was worth every dollar I spent. I truly love the satirical aspects of the film and how it savages the corporate-yuppie \"Greed is good\" lifestyle that did so much to disfigure the 1980s. The dialogue is great, too- I especially like the scene where Emil Antonowsky (Paul McCrane) says \"Hey, wait a minute! I know you- you're DEAD! We KILLED YOU! WE KILLED YOU!\" And then there was the hilarious \"Dave\" bit. My co-workers and I still yell the line, \"I'D BUY THAT FOR A DOLLAR!\" at one another!" "This film is really well made and everyone should check it out. This film has good action and a little sense of humor. The story is very good. Murphy/Robocop dies on his first day of the job and his body gets used for the Robocop program. So he is like brought back to life. After he becomes Robocop, his memory gets blanked so he won't remember his life. I like the way he goes and finds out who he was and who killed him. He also finds the bad guy in OCP who wants to destroy him. The music is good too and fits in with the theme of the movie. If you really like Sci-Fi films you will like this one. 10 stars for the movie." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "******Warning, Spoilers******** The 1980's, for all its faults, was surely a golden age for intelligent sci-fi/action films - think The Terminator, Aliens and Predator. 1987's Robocop sits comfortably alongside these films as a classic of the genre. Despite the bucketloads of gore and a title which is absolutely ridiculous if one stops to think about, this is a film with heart and soul, and most importantly a message. Paul Verhoeven, directing his first US film, brings the critical eye of an outsider to the me-first decade, and uses the films futuristic setting to lampoon 80's corporate America for all it's worth. Everything bad about yuppie culture is taken to extremes - executives assassinate one another, are involved with organised crime, and see the fact that a fellow exec has been turned into a hamburger by a psychopathic robot as a 'temporary setback'. This is Wall Street with cyborgs and a wicked sense of humor. What's amazing about this film is how tightly scripted it is. It clocks in at just 102 minutes, not one of which is wasted. Verhoeven cleverly uses fictional TV news and commercials to build the world the characters inhabit (a technique he would reuse to lesser effect in Total Recall and Starship Troopers), thereby dispensing with the need to have lots of long winded exposition scenes. These segments are where the films satire goes into overdrive - kids play with a high tech version of battleships called Nuke-Em' (\"Get them before they get you!\"), a car named a 6000 SUX is advertised, and a Star Wars strategic defence 'peace platform' incinerates Santa Barbera. The storyline itself is pretty standard comic book stuff - cop gets shot up and turned into cyborg and then has to regain his humanity, but it's told so well, and in such a brilliantly realised setting, that its elevated above its pulp origins. The cast all turn in decent performances, particularly Kurtwood Smith as over-the-top baddie Clarence Boddicker. Also, if you've only ever seen Nancy Allen in Carrie, her turn as ass-kicking cop Ann Lewis is an eye opener. The violence, while extreme (even more so in the directors cut), is more often than not played for laughs - it's hard to take the bit when Emil drives into the toxic waste seriously. A word of praise also for Phil Tippets wonderful stop motion ED - 209. In terms of being a movie with meaning, Robocop should probably be counted among Paul Verhoevens earlier Dutch work such as Soldier of Orange, rather than his later Hollywood offerings. Well worth a look if you only know him as the guy who directed Showgirls.

"This is one great American movie. It has your heroes and your villains. It's got some humor and it's packed full of graphic violence. This is a classic that nobody can deny. This movie rocks. The kind of movie that makes your ass wanna get up and cheer. Robocop, one hell of a movie." "I would have liked to have been in the room when Paul Verhoeven pitched Robocop: \"Ok, you've got this cyborg cop fighting crime in 'old' Detroit; setting: the not too distant future. There'll be political intrigue, bloody over-the-top action, commercials for invented products and very large explosions. But it is going to be funny...it's an action/comedy. Oh, and it will star Peter Weller from that BUCKAROO BANZAI flick...and Jose Ferrer's kid, what's-his-name...whatever. Gimme, gimme, gimme money so I can make this great and deranged film!\" How did ROBOCOP get made? Who cares...it is a great movie. I saw this when I was ten or eleven and thought it was the pinnacle of cinematic achievement. Was there a better film circa 1988? Not for me there wasn't. Since then, I've grown up...expanded my knowledge of film, and realized that perhaps ROBOCOP isn't quite the masterpiece that I had thought. It still stands the test of time, however, and remains wonderfully entertaining. Kurtwood Smith's villain stands out as one of the most slimy of the 80's (along with Alan Rickman in DIE HARD). The makeup effects, by Rob Bottin, remain far superior to the computer generated effects they blight films with now; Basil Poledouris' musical theme is one of the most \"hummable\" in recent memory. A shudder never fails to work its way up my spine at some of the most gruesome moments... Films like ROBOCOP, PREDATOR, GREMLINS, DIE HARD amongst others, shaped my life from fragile early childhood. This may explain why I was so screwed up: I rigged sqibbs on my G.I. Joe figures, I laughed at car accidents, and was well on my way to becoming completely de-sensitized to all violence. But what are you going to do right? ROBOCOP helped me through some painful moments during my life as well. Like when I saw Ronny Cox in 'Cop Rock'; I said \"that's Dick Jones, he runs OCP! He runs the cops!\" What the hell was he doing singing on TV?...\"What would ROBOCOP do in this situation?\" I would ask myself as I began hitting the television screen with a chair. And why didn't Kurtwood Smith get better roles than THE CRUSH? He was in ROBOCOP right?...he's a movie star! Why didn't anyone else think that Nancy Allen was sexy?... It took me awhile to realize that (while as good as ROBOCOP is) it is simply a high-concept B-flick that walks a fine satirical line. If Verhoeven would have missed one step along the way, ROBOCOP could have quickly become one of the worst films of all time. He pulls it off, however, and let's hope that his warped film will continue to corrupt the youth of America for years to come. Excuse me now, I have to punch out all the windows of my car. Thank You. 8/10" "A lot of ppl call this movie violent. No it isn't. That's just red jam coming out of everyone's wounds...argh, it's so simple. Anywho...this movie is so cool cuz the concept was awesome, the story moves well, the bad guys are really evil (read: kurtwood smith is gold EVERYWHERE, and ronny cox), and for an action film with lots of violence (violence for a reason), it had emotion and it's funny parts. Oh and as a kid the evil bot FREAKED me out. Crazy... Anywho, if you haven't watched this, then what you waiting for? Do it now!" "When I first saw \"Robocop\" during its 1987 theatrical run, I was seventeen years old and quite honestly had never seen a movie THAT violent in my entire life. Naturally, I loved it. The story was straight out of comic books (which are another passion of mine...and Robo DID eventually make it into comics a year or two after the first movie), and \"Robocop\" has a wicked sense of humor that elevates it past the normal mindless blow-em-up action picture. I enjoyed both sequels as well, but nothing beats the original. Fifteen years later it's kind of funny to see Kurtwood Smith, who played Robo's arch-nemesis Clarence Boddicker, playing \"Red\" on \"That 70's Show\", though. :) The eventual syndicated televison series toned down the mayhem of the films and is pretty much unwatchable unless you're hung over and there's nothing better on TV. Stick with the film series, starting here." "ive seen this movie hundreds of times and is still awesome!! the best cyborg bought on film ever. Peter Weller is excellent as Robo and the villains are great. check out the directors cut, even better!! 10/10" "Robocop is a great movie. A+, one of my favorites definate good movie to own , but better to own on DVD or DVD limited edition!! I'm hoping to get my hands on the limited edition (regular version, uncut). In fact it is the best robocop movie that there is. You can even check ratings. Do not see any other robocop's were horrible." "I can play \"Soldier of Fortune\", I can watch \"Day of the Dead\", but i just cannot stomach the violence in Robocop. It's horrible, it disturbs me beyond belief and is literally nauseating. The thing is about the violence is that it's exaggurated. For example, in this film, if someone cut their finger open, there'd be fountains and fountains of blood that would flood the room. As it happens, no one cuts their fingers. But arms are blown off, brains gush out of bullet riddled heads, and one man gets his guts blown open by a minigun. It's horrible! The most unwatchable film ever!" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "[CONTAINS SPOILERS] This movie is an all-time favorite of mine. I didn't like it when I first saw it, but I went back and watched it again later and loved it. This one, II and III are all favorites. I rented them at the video store so much I probably put the retailer's kids through college. The city of Detroit is currently in turmoil. A cop killer named Clarence Boddicker and his men are wreaking havoc on the city and killing cops this way and that; A giant corporation called OCP (Omni Consumer Products) owns half of it. It's run by The Old Man (Halloween III: Season of the Witch's Dan O'Herlihy) and his partner Dick Jones (Ron Cox). OCP is also in control of the local police department where a new cop, Murphy (Peter Weller who turned 55 2 days ago) was joining. He's partnered with Anne Lewis, an aggressive street cop. Meanwhile, a meeting is held at the OCP complex. They've decided human police officers are inefficient so they've build a giant automation called ED-209, programmed to stop crime dead in its tracks. Literally. A young executive volunteers to do a demonstration, but ED-209 backfires and frontfires at the poor man. (Gruesome!!!) All seems lost until an ambitious executive Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer) decides to make his own crime fighting machine. Only he must find a candidate to become the machine. Poor Murphy is killed by Clarence and his men so they turn him into the machine: RoboCop. He foils a liquor store robbery attempt and saves the mayor's life. Anne Lewis recognizes Murphy in all that armor. One by one, RoboCop arrests Clarence and his men. Only problem: they're on Dick Jones' payroll. He bails them out of jail and sics ED-209 on Robo. So he and Lewis hideout at a refinery. Clarence and his men go after him with hi-tech weaponry. Robo takes them all out then heads back to OCP to prove Dick Jones guilty. The day is saved, thanks to RoboCop (Murphy.) A brilliant movie, I must say. See it! I recommend it! (If you've got the uncut DVD, you'll see this movie the way it was meant to be seen. It's very gruesome and graphic, but if that's your cup of tea, it's your cup of tea). -" "Recently, I decided to reaquaint myself with an old friend, Paul Verhoeven's sci-fi classic: Robocop. It's brilliance still shines after all these years. Film critic Mark Kermode once said that what made The Exorcist brilliant, was the fact that it worked on so many levels. Robocop works on even more levels: as an action film, it more than delivers, as a social commentry, it gives us a stern warning about the direction we are going in, as a satire, it takes stinging stabs at the Regan era with the privitisation of the police etc. ''You have 20 seconds to comply.''" "Verhoeven has this apocalyptic vision I believe that inspires brilliance in many of his films. ROBOCOP is arguably the best of all of them, though TOTAL RECALL remains probably his most successful and arguably Schwarzewnegger's piece de resistence! Everything about ROBOCOP bears the mark of professionalism. Tight script, superb action sequences and outstanding fx. Peter Weller, unfairly categorised as a \"B\" List actor (mainly through lack of being offered better roles) is spot on here as Officer Murphy, sadistically tortured and shot whilst doing his duty (a graphically presented set-piece that doubtless incurred it's \"R\" certificate) whose few remaining functional parts are cannibalised in the re-construction of the bio-mechanical lawman ROBOCOP. Wanna tell me we couldn't use a guy like this now? Verhoeven pits intelligence against violence in a deft weave. The film is multi-layered and can be viewed on levels ranging from the mindless to the quizzical. Is there not a strong religious theme here after ROBOCOP himself is cruelly \"murdered\" and then resurrected? The film heightens both the inherent evils present in modern day living and the fact that still, decency and honor win out eventually? For all its violence, which its detractors still gleefully evince, ROBOCOP remains I consider, a socially responsible film. As action fare alone, it was not only one of the best on offer in the 80's (it kicked ass, like none before it) but it was years ahead of its time. Watching it today, it has aged but little. Do not even THINK of comparing it to the one-dimensional Verhoevenless sequel which was as bad as this was great!"

"Paul Verhoeven's Robocop is a most unusual type of film. It succeeds in being almost everything. On the surface, the film might just look like an action picture. And it's exactly that. Robocop is ungodly violent; just as it should be. Robocop is also a wicked satire, on everything from the media to big corporations. Like most Paul Verhoeven films, Robocop is brilliant. Violent and funny -- the perfect 80's movie." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Released in 1987, Robocop, the movie, stands as the ultimate symbolic testament to Christianity. Unlike other movies of the decade like The Breakfast Club, St. Elmo's Fire, or Sixteen Candles, Robocop was not afraid to be religious, entertaining and packed with butt kicking action. Like other movies depicting Christ figures (i.e. The Terminator, Aliens and Superman III), Robocop was extremely poignant omitting no details of the life and times of Jesus Christ. The movie begins by introducing Officer Alex Murphy, a streetwise cop with a soft side. He is gunned down by an affiliation of drug pushing psychopaths. I was immediately reminded of the Romans and how they gunned down Jesus in that seemingly abandoned warehouse. After Murphy is considered dead, an organization called OCP combines the biological flesh of his body with steel, circuitry and a fistful of attitude. This was exactly like the resurrection. As Jesus did rise, so did Alex Murphy. Sure, back in Biblical times, they could only really rebuild Jesus with wood and cement, so it might take a stretch of the imagination to fully see the connection. Murphy, in the form of Robocop, is sent out onto the mean streets of Detroit. As he guns down criminal after criminal in a savage manner, I was reminded of the way Christ shot up Roman oppressors like lambs bent for slaughter. The end of the movie is where it gets really good. The drug pushing psychopaths that attacked Murphy, a.k.a. Proto-Jesus, are cornered by Murphy. They try to stop him with a giant magnet, somewhat similar to the way Satan caught Jesus in a tiger trap. Robocop gets free and in a series of dizzying action sequences, he blows the leader of the drug pushers away, until there's not even enough left of him to smear like Jelly on toast. Then, Robocop ascends to the Heavens in order to wage war on Lucifer's armies. This opened up for Robocop 2: Cyber-Revelations. Some have told me that they missed the symbolism that showed Robocop as a Christ figure. I don't see how that's even possible. Not even Terminator 2 had this many references to Biblical scripture and that movie starred Arnold Schwarzenegger, the `GOD' of action cinema." "Robocop will always rank as a unique oddity within a genre that is constantly regurgitating itself. Paul Verhoeven created a masterpiece, a film which comments on the human condition and makes a statement about life and living. It's quite a head trip to watch this movie, not just for Robocop finding his roots but how the system that created him decides to play God with their reanimated creation. Verhoeven always manages to make a film which is typically entertaining to some degree, and Robocop is such a distinction. Peter Weller and Kurtwood Smith were excellent, and let's not forget about one the best sci-fi scores ever by Basil Poledoris!" "Made in 1987, this film paints a rather bleak picture of the future in it's depiction of the escalation of crime in a major metropolitan area (in this case, the city of Detroit), but what's really disconcerting watching it now is the fact that the reality of today seems to be catching up and closing in on this fictional future all too quickly. And it's a scary proposition when you think about it, which makes `Robocop,' an action/drama directed by Paul Verhoeven, something of a cautionary tale, as well as engrossing entertainment. Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is a veteran police officer, newly assigned to crime infested `Old Detroit,' which is about to undergo a major renovation. Plans are on the board for a multi-million dollar new city, but first the vermin who control the present city have to be eliminated. Toward that end, OCP, the major corporation apparently controlling just about everything (including the police department), are about to unveil a new kind of `policeman,' that will make the `Murphy's' of the force nothing more than support units. What they're proffering is an ominous looking robot, the `Ed-209,' touted by OCP Vice President Dick Jones (Ronny Cox) as the law enforcement of the future. An up-and-comer with OCP, Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer), has ideas of his own, however, that involve a project he's been trying to implement that would feature yet a different kind of `future cop.' And when a demonstration of Ed-209 goes awry, Morton makes his move, pitching his plan to `The Old Man' (Dan O'Herlihy), the CEO of OCP. Murphy, meanwhile, on his first day of duty in Old Detroit, is brutally gunned down and killed (or is he?) by a gang of criminals lead by one Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith). Bad for Murphy, good for Morton, however, who proceeds to turn Murphy into a prototype of his vision of the future of law enforcement. Enter `Robocop,' half human, all cyborg. Good for Detroit, bad for criminals, especially Boddicker and his gang. Because somewhere deep inside of what's left of Murphy, is a glimmer of memory. And Boddicker's face was the last thing he ever saw. Going into this project, Verhoeven definitely had a vision of what he wanted this film to be. That vision was dark and violent, and he succeeded in bringing it to fruition, in grand and graphic style. The finished product is extremely violent and at times unpleasant to watch; but it's also riveting filmmaking, and quite effective. it works because Verhoeven gives you more than just a gore-fest; despite the graphic violence (the scene in which Murphy is gunned down, for example, is beyond brutal), he keeps the human element at the heart of the story. He never lets you forget that beneath all that armor there is-- or was-- a man. And he gives you just enough background of Murphy's personal life to make you care about him, and it makes what happens to him all the more disturbing. On the other side of the coin, his villains are despicable, and you get to a point where you can't wait for Robocop to mete out the justice they so readily deserve. Verhoeven's presentation is solid and cohesive, perfectly complementing the action with the drama, which affords the audience a satisfying cinematic experience. And quite an experience it is. In a challenging role, Peter Weller succeeds in his portrayal of this man-turned-machine; in lesser hands, Robocop may have been nothing more than a machine with a bit of flesh beneath the metal, but Weller plays to the man inside, rather than the machine that encases him, and it makes a huge difference in the way the character is perceived. Weller's performance enables the audience to become emotionally involved with the `Murphy' he presents, rather than offering just a soulless `Robocop,' which from an action standpoint would have been fine, but would have diminished the drama and the overall impact of the film. Obviously, this is something Verhoeven and Weller realized, and in the final analysis, it was their collaboration and like-minded approach to the character that made this film really work. Another interesting aspect of this film is that there are three significant villains, each plying their own unique brand of treachery, and all effectively presented by the actors portraying them. Cox epitomizes the unscrupulous corporate executive, who cares less about the service or product he can provide than the `bottom line,' while Ferrer's Morton is an insufferable snake. The worst of the bunch, however, is Smith's Boddicker, the kind of villain you love to hate, but who is also unsettling upon reflection, as his outward appearance so subtly masks what a truly evil individual he is. You hate to think that there are really people like this walking around free in the world. Also turning in memorable performances are Nancy Allen, as Murphy's partner, Anne Lewis; Ray Wise, as Leon Nash, one of Boddicker's bunch; and Paul McCrane, as Emil, another of Boddicker's men (McCrane is especially good at creating characters you despise, as he does with his portrayal here, and currently as Dr. Romano is TV's `ER'). The supporting cast includes Robert DoQui (Sergeant Reed), Felton Perry (Johnson), Jesse D. Goins (Joe), Del Zamora (Kaplan), Calvin Jung (Minh), Rick Lieberman (Walker), Lee de Broux (Sal), Mark Carlton (Miller) and Edward Edwards (Manson). Hard-edged, thought-provoking, visceral entertainment, `Robocop' is a film you may have to steel yourself a bit for, but it's well made and delivered, and ultimately, a mesmerizing cinematic experience that far exceeds the typical action genre formula. It's violent, but then again, so is real life; and this is one of Life's stories." "I went to this movie with skepticism, and left loving it. Fictitious, but with realism in the what if extent of the possibility of this happening. This is a good film about the victim finding out the question of Who am I. When the guy gets fired, you will understand how that goes with the prime directive. The commercials, and news stories create humor, and realism at the same time. I love the dark humor, they use the dad from \"That 70's show\" as a heel, with a lot of humor when he does a hit, where they play a video cd. The end is great, and the film goes full circle, but you got to laugh at what happens to the Ed 90, and I love those Cobra Assault guns. Rent this if you love Sci-fi. 10/10" "Forget Dirty Dancing and all those other so called 'feel good' films. This is what cheers people up, seeing scummy little criminals beaten to a pulp by an indestructible being. The only shame is that it was make believe & they weren't real muggers, robbers & thieves. We could do with some real 'robocops' at the moment. We don't really need any other films in this genre though as this has really said all there is, but it's always worth a look. 8/10" "This classic near-future sci-fi works both as the ultra-violent effects-laden action flick and the cynical critisism of the corruption that permeates our modern world. It is full of memorable one-liners and over the top shocker scenes. Violence is abundant but never pointless or glorified. The movie is by far not without flaws... for example, what about the scene when he consults the database in the police station? Aren't they seeing what kind of truth he has discovered and wouldn't they somehow prevent him from going out and \"doing his job\"? But the good thing is that things like these don't really matter. The film just keeps rolling and your thoughts don't linger on the flaws. This is one of the rare films that you tend to enjoy not as much for its substance but rather its style and for a couple of scenes that can be re-watched without ever getting boring BUT at the same time does score some rather strong points in terms of message, ability to provoke thought and overall intelligence. 8/10" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Warning: Possible Spoilers I loved this movie. It was dark, and yes it was violent, but is was very cool. The mixture of comedy (for example, the continuous stream of T.V. ads for stuff such as a board game called \"Nuke Em!\") and drama (I found the scene where RoboCop discovers the fate of his wife and child strangely moving) works really well. When I first saw it, I wasn't expecting it to be so much of a satire, but it was this that leant the movie its edge. Performances were okay. Weller did as much of a good job as he could within the suit, and Allen was likeable as his sidekick. Kurtwood Smith and Ronny Cox were sufficiently evil as the bad guys, making the film greatly entertaining. Plus, how could you not love a movie which contains everyone's favourite \"melting man being run over\" scene. 9 out of 10." "This movie is one of the best movies of all time. The special effects, the musical score, everything about it is great. I've seen this movie over and over and it never gets boring. Peter Weller is excellent playing the famous Robocop. To put in simple words what I think about the movie: Robocop rules!" "Robocop,Paul Verhoeven's Sci-fi action yarn is the best film I have ever seen.It is intelligent with its political and American social issues and Director Paul Verhoeven does more than deliver the overblown and ultra stylish action set pieces(the melting man,the warehouse shootout). It also delivers on the violent side, most memorable of course is the death of Murphy as he executed in the same way as Jesus. The trashy news flashes bring out the comedy in the film,and the death of Murphy pulls the tragic side of the drama into it.The film moves at a rollicking pace,is never taken too seriously and leads you all the way through to the truly thrilling climax. A matchless masterpiece, and a film that you have to see to believe!"

"*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS It may have been produced purely to capitalize on the success of that other eighties cyborg cult-hit The Terminator, but Robocop still manages to not only thrill, but also entertain. I use the word still, but to be honest, I only saw the film really for the first time today (I got the Director's cut DVD today for my birthday), so I have no idea what people though of it when it first came out, I know it must have been big business as it necessitated two crap sequels and two TV spin offs (one animated, one live action). I also remember the kids at my high school talking about it every time it was show on television the night before, I was once lucky enough to see one of those screenings, but sadly for me, it was edited for TV. Which made watching Verhoeven's gore splattered director's cut toady a real eye opening experience. Where as in the TV version, say for example Murphy's (Peter Weller) death scene, we saw some guns go off, heard a couple of comedic one-liners, then wee saw a body hit the floor. So, for the rest of the film, we had no idea what kind of agony Murphy went through, so therefore, we are unable to feel enough of a connection with him to get more out of the film. But seeing the character of Murphy destroyed by shotgun blast in the un-cut version, his limbs torn from his body, the laughs and now menacing one-liners, only made Robocop's struggle all the more moving as the film reached it's third act. That's always been my problem with the censor board, they are all to willing to have guns, being fired and people being killed, but we're not allowed to see the actual effect that a gun can do to a human body. So we get films like the Matrix, in which fifty people are killed (by the hero I might add) being deemed suitable for young teenagers, and that's fine, as long as we don't see the consequences of a violent act. Then, conversely we can have a film like Natural Born Killers, which was held back from distribution and brought-up all kinds of political debates, as to whether or not the film was dangerous, all because Oliver Stone was brave enough to show the effect that violent crimes have on people, maybe if he didn't do the greatest job with said material, he was still persecuted for a film in which, although about killers, had less people killed than in the Matrix. And this is a problem that has followed Verhoeven throughout his career. Admittedly, sometimes the violence in his films can be exploitative, like for example Star-ship Troopers, but in Robocop the violence is completely justified, as it's from that unforgiving violent act that the story is developed. Judging from Robocop, they should really let euro art-house directors make Hollywood blockbusters more often. Paul Verhoeven, then better know for his Dutch art films Turkish Delight, Soldier of Orange and The 4th Man, not only heightens the dramatic impact of the characters, but also the harsh social critique directed at America. The film not only looks at the problems with capitalization if big business, the privatisation of the police force, and the growing consciousness of the mass media, it also has a strong message about the triumph of the soul. How many blockbusters would even attempt to pick-up on any of those issues, few I can think of. A truly underrated film from the eighties cycle of violent action. 8/10" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "I loved this movie. The violence is good in this movie. The bad guys are hatable in it. Dick Jones was an excellent bad guy. So was Clarence Bodicker. There won't be many more villains like them. MINOR SPOILER - directive 4 was a brilliant idea for this movie.END OF SPOILER. The Old Man that owns OCP in this one is cool. This one is lots of FUN. The action , violence , ideas, and acting all make this movie legendary. Alot of the scenes happen at night which I thought was cool. This movie has one of the best endings ever to it. Bob Morton the guy that designs Robocop is likeable too. This is a good move with a good plot good violence and good characters." "RoboCop is one of the greatest movies ever made and it is also my favorite movie. It has a great story about a man who was killed on the line of duty and resurrected as a crime fighting cyborg. Yes this movie has a lot of violence but I think it is relevant because it matches the story and it also shows how bad the world can get. Also this movie is about slavery. Murphy was robbed of his right to die. He has become a slave of the world because of his directives to serve the public trust, protect the innocent, and to uphold the law. As a cop he had the choice to bend the rules to get things right. But since these rules are now programmed into him, he has to follow them to the letter. Even if he wanted to save someone and it meant bending the rules to 'uphold the law' he could not. Worse yet, there was a fourth directive to never oppose an OCP officer. OCP was the bad guy but he could not do anything about it. If he was fully human then maybe he could. A great movie with a great story. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes Sci-fi. I also recommend RoboCop: Prime Directives which was a great mini-series. Anyway, I think this movie is the greatest Sci-fi movie ever!" "Detriot cop peter weller is transformed in to unstopable crime fighting machine,after being guned down by a gang of violent thug's. Then goes out to get revenge. Savage sc-fi action with some nicely satirical moment's on the behalf of big corporation's. Started conterversal dutch director paul verhoeven's hollywood career. Sc-fi fan's will love it but some may be replused by it's graphic violence. five stars out of five" "Paul Verhoeven's ambitious action masterpiece was a huge success at the time of its release in 1987, but I tend to think that it would not be nearly a successful if a film like it had been released today. Action and science fiction movies have come a long way since the 80's, and it's also no secret that the success of Robocop owes a huge amount to it's far superior predecessor, The Terminator, but Robocop is also very much able to stand on its own. The first Teminator film, released in 1984, is undeniably the film that really launched interest in the whole man vs. machine/cyborg theme, Robocop came along a few years later and renewed that interest, then we had a pathetic installment called Cyborg from Van Damme in 1989, a couple of mediocre Robocop sequels, and of course, the stunningly successful and well-made Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Robocop is separated from The Terminator most significantly in that the entire movie takes place in the future and there is not time travel (other than that) involved. The conflict here is not necessarily between man and machine, but between man and man where machine is used as a weapon between the two. It is definitely a more basic version of the almost universal good vs. evil story structure, with man on either end of the story in this case and each with their own superhuman robot to fight the other with. The story is thankfully complicated by the involvement of a gang of tremendously hardcore criminals who work for the bad guys at OCP but are not necessarily controlled by them, which leaves open a lot of possibilities in the plot and prevents it from being entirely predictable. Robocop is definitely among the most violent non-Scorsese films out there, almost to the point of being nauseating. This is definitely not something to show to the kids (although my parents allowed me to watch it over and over when I was a kid myself  I don't know how I could stand it), but it's good for something to watch when you're in the mood for what seems to be a really bad action movie that somehow managed to succeed. The movie is well written and well-acted (although some of the criminals in the film were exaggerated to the point of amusement), and has some startlingly realistic special effects, especially the shootings (although I've never actually seen anyone get shot before, so I can only assume that that's what it looks like). Robocop is almost like a cult classic, because someone who watches it now for the first time is not likely to enjoy it very much although original fans are likely to defend the film to no end, but it is definitely among the best of director Paul Verhoeven's U.S. films, which include mediocre productions like Showgirls and Hollow Man. This movie is undoubtedly more violent than most people are likely to enjoy, but if there is a place in modern cinema for gratuitous violence(and I tend to think that there is) then it is in movies like Robocop. It is a movie that was never meant to win any Academy Awards, and it earns respect by not pretending that it is." "Paul Verhoeven's sophomore effort and still his best.Set in Detroit, the near future, we see that crime is rampant. In comes OCP, a giant corporation the likes that will exist in the States within ten years (a merger between, say, General Electric, Exxon and Microsoft) to deliver a new weapon against crime. Their first project failed due to a slight mishap, poor Mr. Kinney. That weapon is Robocop, part man - namely former cop Murphy who stood in the way of a barrage of gunfire and did not live to tell about it- and part machine. Only, Murphy's brain wasn't completely erased and soon he's out on the town to find Boddicker, the man that did this to him. Turns out that Boddicker is teaming up with OCP's own Vice-President to stop Robo in his tracks. So what makes this one so interesting. Satire as always, on American life, consumerism, big business, the media, violence, lots of violence and in the middle a Christlike parable. See Robo walk on water in his final confrontation with Boddicker! The commercials - Nuke'Em, the family game-, the bits of TV-news -the new SDI-space center misfired, killing four former Presidents- and the inner workings between the OCP exec's are all meant to poke fun at American society, a society that can use a bit of critique every once in a while (well, maybe not this week). But beware, this movie oozes with gore, the scene where badguy nr. 6 drives his van in a big vat of chemical waste comes to mind, and violence. Alternatively, if you're into that sort of thing, the DVD has got the uncut version, filled with even more bits of mayhem. Don't bother with the sequel; it tried to emulate but never came close." "Ultraviolence at its best! RoboCop is one of the most violent movies I have ever seen, but this doesn't make it bad at all. Paul Verhoeven exaggerates with violence into a whole new level in cinematic history, and has thereby created a great atmosphere, which makes it a great movie. The story is fairly good (good guys vs. bad guys), ok for a sci-fi action-movie. The acting was good and I especially liked Kurtwood Smith (Clarence) as the arch villain, somehow his parts in movies always end up being a bad guy and he's outstanding in that specific job! In overall it holds a great entertaining-value and is a movie you can watch over and over again! 8 out of 10" "Let's set the record straight, RoboCop isn't Terminator and Paul Verhoeven isn't James Cameron. However, these two are very similar in their styles and this is proof. The mixing of crude or vulgar humor with gory (what some may consider excessive) violence is wonderful. You can't help but laugh when the store thief, rapist, or ultra-cool ED-209 get theirs in particularly funny was. Granted the seriousness and decay of Detroit causes more serious deaths (Clarence, Joey, Bob Morton, misc. police) the corporate cruelty befalling the city by the underworld only reinforces the fact that our society is becoming more and more like this one. Beware the enforcement droids!" "Simply a brilliantly made film, which seems humorous considering the subject matter. Verhoeven manages to create an atmosphere that hasn't really been touched since. The ultra-violence mixes superbly with the dark comedy to create the just-slightly-in-the-future Detroit setting. Then, to top it all off we get a great Christ parable as well. Murphy is killed and then resurrected in order to clean up the system. Keep your eyes peeled near the end so you don't miss the walking on water scene. They actually built boards under the water for Peter Weller to walk on so don't think it's just shallow water, that's on purpose. Basically, if you can handle the violence and you're prepared for the tongue in cheek attitude of the movie, you've got to love it. Just don't watch Robocop 3 whatever you do." "When this film first came out I went with my father to see it. We were on an extroadinarily long line, my first \"blockbuster\" film experience that I could remember (I can barely remember waiting for E.T. my only other previous experience with such a high scale film). Needless to say, when the ED-209 scene came on, I was flipping my shihtzu (heh), and we had to walk into Revenge Of The Nerds II instead. Crica: 1989, I rented Robocop, trying to understand the extreme emotions from only a few years previous. I like to think that a movie capable of extracting such extreme emotions as it did me, from an individual is worth checking out. This movie ended up becoming one of my favorite Sci-Fi films of all time. I love Paul Verhoven, he is such a visionary director. A lot of people seem to end up asking the \"how\"s and \"why\"s of his material, which is more often than not a personally motivated statement, usually personal vision of social commentary. This film works on both levels of social commentary in an extreme ideal that it could be interpreted to people who cannot look into the surreal elements of our culture and society everyday. You have to admit, it is quite surreal, and thus- in cinema, people expect reality times ten. A sort of reality on steroids, even in fantasy pieces. Verhoven delivers in this respect, but at points going over the heads of some of the more action-film prone audience who end up criticising rather than interpreting. Robocop's place in Sci-Fi history is somewhat skewed by its sketchy sequels, but I never judge a film by its followups. Never forget who or why, and the term \"how\" could be very well a recurrent theme in the fact of comparison to the fact that only a small handful of films in the following 14 years lives up to the quality of this films resolve."

"Robocop is one of those movies that kids weren't allowed to see but wanted to and did anyways. In Detroit a cop is killed by a drug lord and is brought back by a greedy company as a cyborg programmed to fight crime. The sleaze that killed Murphy has an devilishly programmed robot built by the same company pose a threat to him. The guy who plays the villain was very good and freaked me out as a kid. It's weird to see him on that 70's show. Peter Weller does a decent job as robocop and Murphy. Some of the movie doesnt hold up wiht time but the effects and violent action still hold up. The scene that always freaked me out was when the red head dude is hideously mutatedby toxic waste. Cool for action/adventure and sci fi fans.***" "I bought this movie on the DVD Criterion Collection, and I feel I am qualified to make the following statement. Paul Verhoeven should not make any more movies. This guy has made a lot movies that should not have been made. He made Showgirls and Basic Instinct, which how they got an R and not a NC-17 I will never know. He made The Hollow Man, which was nice eye candy. As was Starship Troopers and Total Recall. But all his (American) movies has one thing in common, I feel really dirty and guilty after sitting through them. Verhoeven is a technically masterful director. He works with accomplished actors and actresses with long distinguished careers, with the exception of Showgirls of course, but they are just dirty films. RoboCop is a great example of this. A science fiction movie with Kurtwood Smith and Peter Weller should be golden. It should be something that you would watch with your friends on a movie marathon night right between Terminator and Aliens. And while this movie is one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever, it really doesn't fit in with any other movie, you know except for Total Recall. Rating 8 but with reservations." "As a child of the 80's I would just like to say that this was the last great sci-film of that decade. Sci-fi just doesn't have the same meaning anymore. It's all effects driven nowadays, and that's not too tempting considering the fact that most cgi is so poorly done! But robocop didn't rely completely on ground-breaking visuals, instead there was a story to stand strong on. Filmmakers should one day take a break from their coke-snorting lives and take notes on this movie...it'd really help. And if I half to witness one more sci-fi abomination, THAT'LL BE THE LAST STRAW, I'll bloody switch to romantic comedies!!! Urgh!" "Don't let the comic book approach fool you. This story in primarily a drama, and a very human one at that. Murphy is a man, a human being, with a life, a love, a family, etc. All that is taken away from him, but not so much by the criminals with the shotguns like most people think. They were very cruel in 'dismantling' Murphy piece by piece, but at all times they were shooting at a PERSON. It was OCP's execs that finished the job in trying to remove his humanity from him. It was they that took the arm he had left, took his memories, took the things that we all take for granted. It was they that tried to remove the humanity from the man. But they failed. Murphy's humanity showed through at all times, though thinly at first. Just the twirling gun, the favorite catch phrase, just the little things we usually don't even think about. As his memories almost returned in the form of dreams his humanity responded next with a cry for vengeance. He sought out his killers, not realizing who the real killers were. When he DID find out who was really behind his death, it only led to him being brought down in a hail of gunfire again, this time at the hands of the police. Again his outside forces were trying to strip away his humanity, but this time it backfired. The human that had relearned courage and duty was now forced to relearn fear. Thus humanity was strengthened on one of our greatest failings. He survived the ordeal the second time, and it was then that he confessed his humanity to Nancy Allen's character. He could feel the loss of his family, but couldn't remember their names. After this he had to face his killers again. Boddicker and his gang? They hated him. They feared him. They wanted to kill him. Him. Not It. They were still shooting at a person, not a thing. At the end Murphy was robbed of the chance to overcome his programming and arrest Dick Jones, but it didn't matter by that point. The CEO (as played by Dan O'Herlihy) asked for his name, he gave it. Murphy. Not Robocop. His program still limited him much like the written laws might limit the spirit of what our police officers are trying to do while protecting us, but Murphy was a HIM now, never again to be an IT. All the jokes, the cartoonish violence, even that \"I'll buy that for a Dollar!\" guy couldn't distract from the sheer victory for humanity announced in that one simple two syllable word, Murphy." "Half man, half machine and he's a cop. What great subject matter for a gritty not-so-distant \"future\" movie. So my question is why did this concept take so long to be realized? It's an entertaining movie on different levels, but more so, it presents a very dark, sad, but true portrait of urban America as it is becoming. Crime is steadily increasing and law enforcement are understaffed, under budgeted, outnumbered and out gunned and it doesn't appear like it's going to be changing anytime soon. Welcome to New Detroit. The story of Murphy (Peter Weller) losing his own human live to only be turned around and made into a mecha savior for the masses is a topic all it's own. Sure the primary story arch is as gratifying as it is easy to follow - there's a conspiracy of some grand level going on as there always is and its very easy to spot the bad guys, who are clear and clear bad, but no matter on how many levels this movie engages you - it works brilliantly in the face of it's own simplicity noticeably because of these layers. I could drown on about it some more, but you really need to see the movie for yourself. Paul Verhoven who's known to do some pretty controversial and high profile material emerges from this movie with an instant classic. The story works its weaves, the cast is good, the black humor and tone throughout is strong, the action done proper and the whole thing stands up well faced with genre peers. If only the Verhoven-less sequels could have kept the train from leaving the track." "I watch this several time and I never got bored. Despite of so called \"cartoon\" feel, it didn't really bother me (The similar formula used later in Starship Troopers) The story is pretty good and it mixed with irony, satire, humor and melodrama. 8 out of 10" "From the year 1970 to 2000 there were more people killed at crime scenes in the United States than all the wars the nation has ever indulged in from the year of its inception in 1776. The media loves crime and war, so the media tells us as it constantly searches for advertisers and consumers. Thus, this film, a \"kill-for-fun\" genre product, in keeping with Earth culture, is still engrossing and has a merciful strain of humanity running through it despite its body bag count. Perhaps this is more of a nod to the inside core of its market than any contact with compassion. If Mary Godwyn Shelley was alive in 1987, the year Robocop was released, instead of 1817, the year her novel, Frankenstein, was published; this film might have amused her. It lifts its best elements from her immortal book." "Everything in this movie works perfectly! A good story, a blazing pace, a sense of humor, good performances, lots of action, and one of the best scores ever make this one of my all time favorite movies. Peter Weller's performance is great and Kurtwood Smith is one of the best villains ever! This was Paul Verhoeven's first and best American Movie. Made for only 13 million, it offers more bang for your buck than countless other huge budgeted movies. Watch it and see what I mean. The two sequels are alright, but can't even compare to this one. Many people want a fourth Robocop to be made, but why? They should have only made one in the first place! Either that or handled the sequels better. A true action classic that works on many other levels." "Robocop is a very violent movie, which is not for the fainthearted, but it's done so in a Troma film-like way. A Detroit cop is nearly killed in the line of duty and brought back on foot by cyborg-like technology. When he gets his original memory back he vows revenge on the sadistic psychopaths that shot him (Kurtwood Smith, who wastes his talent on \"That 70s Show\" played one mean bad guy here.) The plot is meat and potatoes but it becomes more of a satire on the corruption and imperialistic ways of capitalism. Total Recall, which was directed three years later by Paul Verhoeven, has that same kind of satire. A classic film, and if you have an action movie collection, this movie should be in it." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "My first comment posted on imdb was for RoboCop, but all it said was to avoid \"RoboCop 2.\" Looking back, that seemed like a pretty lame way to comment on \"RoboCop,\" my favorite movie of all time. I hereby present the following, more relevant review: \"How can your favorite movie be RoboCop?\" I get that question a lot now, it seems. I'm not sure I want to write some kind of terribly detailed explanation of why this is my favorite movie of all time. Quite simply, everything in the movie works for me. To therefore try to explain what I like about the movie would equate to me writing about why a joke is funny when someone didn't get it. However, I'll give an effort here. I'll go ahead and state two main reasons on why I like the movie that most other fans of the movie probably didn't already state, such as the notion that it is a great satire of the corporatization of America, that it is ultra-violent and therefore cool, or that it works great as a bleak near-future sci-fi comedy. I didn't really dwell on those things when I saw this movie the first few times. So what did I like about it? SPOILER ALERT First of all, it is an extreme movie, but unlike many movies the extremeness works in this case. I felt the lowest point of disgust, the most uncomfortable fear, the highest thrills of triumph, moments of sadness, and moments of hilarity. The execution of Alex Murphy is one of the most horrifying things I had ever seen. I felt sooooo bad because of what happened, but this was brilliant on the part of the filmmakers because it made RoboCop that much more fun to root for, and it made his revenge that much sweeter. RoboCop then exists to counter all the woes we can experience. One very scary scene to me is the one where Emil threatens the college boy at the gas station (for anyone who's ever been behind the counter in a store, this scenario is dreadful!). It's even scarier than the scene where the armed robber holds up the mom and pop store, because in the other scene you know what Emil is capable of. Anyway, in both cases, out comes RoboCop to put the fear back in to the criminal. Elsewhere, RoboCop experiences deep loss because he has lost his past life, and for him to slowly realize that was very sad to me; he slowly finds out that he has lost his life and has been turned into a programmed robot. The scene where he revisits his house really made me sad; no one else gets a chance to come back from the dead and see what has happened since he had died and what he has lost because of it, and no one ever should. Therefore it's another joy to watch him triumph beyond that as well, as he starts to regain some semblance of free will and identity (and, thus, end the movie on a high note when he answers the question of \"What's your name?\" with a self-assured \"Murphy.\"). Add to that the satirical humor littered throughout the movie (the corporate cutthroats, the stupid \"I'd buy that for a dollar!\" guy, the news briefs), and it's got all the ingredients to touch every emotion: anger, pity, elation, laughter. Second of all, to put it quite simply: RoboCop is just plain cool! I loved comic book-style heroes, but to me RoboCop was the ultimate comic book hero. He's a cyborg, and he doesn't look cheesy, he looks slick (having become a fan of Transformers and RoboTech, a cyborg could easily get on my good side). He's got a huge gun that he can holster in his leg. He has great comic hero lines (\"Your move, creep!\" \"Dead or alive, you're coming with me.\" \"Come quietly or there will be... trouble.\"). And best of all, he's practically invulnerable! Poor helpless Murphy gets wasted by one of the most evil gangs of villains you've ever seen; they toy with him and laugh at his slaying. Then he comes back and they can't touch him. In the cocaine factory, he takes them all out, one shot at a time. He throws Clarence Boddicker (to me, the most evil slimeball villain ever; hats off to Kurtwood Smith!) through several windows and barely holds back from strangling him... with ease. The bad guys can't stop him, and in the final showdown, they come somewhat close, but you always know that they don't really have a chance. And these bad guys get it but good in the end. Of course, the worst is Emil's toxic waste death. How many murderers would you like to see get taken out like that? Anyhow, I loved RoboCop as a comic hero and a movie hero. Because you know what happened to him, you root for him all the way, from the moment he is being built to his final showdowns with Clarence and Dick Jones. So many other things are cool in the movie: how RoboCop takes out the rapist, the stop-motion ED-209, the little goofy commercials, the supporting cast which includes Murphy's partner Lewis, Sgt. Reed, RoboCop creator Bob Morton (go Miguel Ferrer, another actor whose specialty is slimeballs!). This is a spectacular entry into sci-fi, and was every much as big in the '80's as other sci-fi greats like Aliens, Terminator, and Predator. But in those movies, the good guys were always disadvantaged. Not so with RoboCop. \"Go Robo!\"" "Add another review" "Find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your Watchlist and rate your favorite movies and TV shows on your phone or tablet!")("Movies, TV & Showtimes" "Celebs, Events & Photos" "News & Community" "Watchlist" "" "Find industry contacts & talent representation" "Manage your photos, credits, & more" "Showcase yourself on IMDb & Amazon" "Sign in with Facebook Other Sign in options" "Own the rights?" "I loved this film ever since I first saw it back in the 80s, but it has so many levels that you notice when you go back and watch it time and time again. A future where Corporations run America is nothing new in films, but where Robocop differs is the fact its very believable. What this movie does is to take privatization one step further by showing a future where the police force of Detroit being privatized by the mega corporation OCP. Its over the top violence shows us just how fragile and meaningless human life can be, in a future where anyone can die in a second and no one is safe. At the same time, although violent it has an almost humorous undertone to the whole thing. Its media-break segments break up the film nicely, and provide the extra narrative to push the story along, without wasting time on needless dialogue which would have only bogged the film down. Our hero Alex Murphy played by Peter Weller doesn't have as much to do in the second half of the movie for obvious reasons, but brings very human qualities to Robo. While Kurtwood Smith is excellent as uber-villain gang boss of old detroit. Anyone who has seen this movie should go and buy the directors cut dvd, which adds more violent scenes which were cut out to avoid NC-17 rating only adds to the film greatly. The Commentary track on the dvd also provides huge insight into the film and story giving so many more opinions which would never have come from just straight watching the film. This is an all time great movie, and should belong on any serious film collectors shelf. Paul Verhoeven once said the thing he regrets most in his career is not taking directing duties on Robocop 2, and it shows as this is a far superior film. The Sequels get more inferior as they go on, and the series is so bad its not even worth the film it was printed on. Ed Neumeier, Jon Davison and Paul Verhoeven work so well as a team as they repeated in the also excellent Starship Troopers, but this, their first film is by far the best, go out and watch it again now!" "I saw this movie recently and I have to say, this movie ROCKED. The uniquely written storyline was excellent, the special effects great, and Peter Weller's portrayal as RoboCop\\Alex Murphy was great. Also, I was blown away by the relentless use of the \"f-word\" and the extreme violence present in the film. Let's face it: Paul Verhoeven created a masterpiece of entertainment." "POW!!!!!! IT'S ROBOCOP!!!..yes the best robo in the world...I Remember,sure i remember...it was 1988 and i saw this movie..LOL...what violence...clarence botker ís a cool bad guy and the scene who botker BLOWS up the heard of murphy's is very cool...Yes this is A CLASSIC CLASSIC,and for the people who don't want to get the PREMIUN VERSION(ALL SCENES,NO CUT) Don't be stuped...it's the best version....R(RATED) KICKED ASS...get the full version [*** / ***] ROBOCOP UP'S!" "Not only is this a brilliant film but it also has the most fantastic music score any film could wish for. Paul Weller plays his part magnificently. There is plenty of violence but not in a gruesome way. Well worth watching if you haven't seen it before. Watch it with the volume RIGHT UP!" "I really love this film. First of all, it has an interesting plot. It's about a police officer who had been shot to death and bring back to life by OCP company. Really interesting. Next, it has a good action scenes. The scene I like best is that Robocop striked the drug lab and when he fought with ED-209. Full of gun firing and explosion. If you like sci-fi movie, it's a MUST-SEE for you." "Robocop cannot be praised enough as it is one of the most original action movies I have ever seen. The film blends violence with humor, something with not all movies can do well. I cannot believe this film was made in 1987 as it still packs a punch. For any fans of Robocop you must purchase the criterion DVD as this is the definitive Robocop and contains the most graphic scenes which were removed to get get an R rating, otherwise it would have got an X. Makes you wonder how violent a film can be to achieve and X rating only for its violence, well believe me when I say this version is very gory. An excellent film." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Why am I writing about RoboCop (1987) in the year 2000? Who will ever read these comments? I just purchased RoboCop on DVD from the Criterion Collection and it still works now as it did then. This is an ultra-violent film in many ways, and then there is humor and hope and justice in it as well. I remember the first time I saw the film. When Murphy gets gunned down by the gang, I was so full of rage it was hard to contain myself. I even felt bad when the young VP gets blown up by Clarence. The character of Clarence Boddiker (sp?) was so truly despicable that I still refer to the actor as \"Clarence\" whenever I see him (e.g. \"That 70's Show\" on Fox) and I shudder. I remember saying, kind of out loud, \"You're fired,\" just moments before it was said in the film. The way the film meted out justice, with its poignant moments and powerful ending, made all of the previous over the top violence tolerable in a way that cannot be said for over-hyped gore fests such as \"Natural Born Killers\" (not to compare the two films, they're vastly different -- but, I'm not a fan of ultra violent flicks. I'll never watch NBK again, because it is so violent and there is no pay back, whereas the bad people in RoboCop definitely get what they deserve. I'm not going to say much about the film here because I think it has so many good points, I could write an extensive essay on it. I give it a 10 out of 10 with the acknowledgment that it cannot be for everyone. I watching the film commentary, I will say that the speakers (director, producer and writer) make mention of something about how this film works as a Sci-Fi movie, which is similar to a comment I made about the recent \"X-Men.\" They say that this film, while in the not too distant future, does not have a lot of surreal or futuristic aspects to it. Basically, they have the robot (ED-209), and RoboCop, and that's about it. It works, because the world they present is not so different from our own. I made the same observation about \"X-Men\" saying that, yes, you have mutants, you have Xavier's school and Magneto's hideaway, then everything else is pretty much as it is in the current world. For both of these films, I thought it strengthened their believability over the comic book world of \"Batman.\" I don't think this is the most powerful observation one can make on this film, but I mention it because it did strike a chord with me as an aspect that can make a film work for a lot of people. If you present it as completely Sci-Fi, or comic book, you shut off a lot of potential audience because there are a lot of people who just aren't going to buy into these alternate worlds. To sum up, if you like RoboCop, watch it again, anytime, and you'll see that you still enjoy it. If you haven't seen it, give it a try, but know that it is violent. If you have a chance to see the Criterion version, check it out and enjoy the extras!" "I think it is superb, verhoven is my favourite director. There is nothing in this movie that I would like to change accept maybe some of the props. I must have seen it about 100 times! It is way ahead of any other movie at the time, has loads of cool one liners effects and story." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "When you hear the title, \"Robocop,\" you instantly think of the countless lame, boring comic-book style films that have been made. However, this is not the case with Paul Verhoeven's breakthrough American film. This is a Frankenstein story set in a crime-ridden world where corporations are buying everyone's future. To say that this movie is ultraviolent is an understatement, but it is greatly out-weighed by the satire. It has references to literature, Vietnam, and the corporate world all wrapped into one spectacular movie. One Murphy is killed by the sadistic drug dealers, you hate them because of their cruelty and brutality; but as the film progresses, you get to know them better, and I actually found them to be pretty funny. That's not to say that I didn't cheer when Robocop blew them away, but you get to realize that they have personality. It's the character development like this that is just one of the many key elements of this film. This is a must-see for all movie go-ers. However, stay away from the sequels; they turned Robocop into what is was never supposed to be; a lame, boring comic book story." "I first saw this movie back in 1989 in south Spain, My view it's the best sci-fi action movie of the late eighties. It has all the settings of a good sci-fi movie, dark futuristic atmosphere, violence, great action scenes, good synth music, harsh gritty language, great climaxes and atmospheric unforgettable scenes, and not to mention great special effects, including the gore scenes. It was followed by two extremely bad sequels. The old coin-up arcade game, was also great fun! They dont make them like this anymore 8/10 points!"

"Next to Terminator, Robocop is the best \"indestructible robot\" live action movie. This movie is never dull, which is what you might expect from a movie like this. The good thing about this movie is instead of showing Robo killing people for an hour, you see how he comes to be, and still has some human qualities. The robot suddenly remembers having a wife and kid, and is curious to learn more. There are good action sequences, which shows how Robocop processes and reacts(like his targeting systems, modes, even the dreaded violations, which results in shutdowns). But by the end of the movie, the \"machine\" is more human than ever, knowing what not to do, and naming itself after the officer who \"it\" once was. Think about it, good movies is where you find this." "I have the Directors cut of Robocop at home. It has SO much blood!! I actually laughed when Ed-2O9 shot that OCP guy because there was so much blood that it was ridiculous! Man, dont let your little kids see the Directors cut. Other than the extra scenes the DVD had, the movie and plot is still classic. I didnt feel sorry for the bad guys (the ones that killed Alex Murphy) Robocop killed no matter how brutally he was doing it. They got what the deserved. Great movie! Part 2 was really good too, but stay away from 3." "Robocop is the story of a man whose identity is stolen. Although hysterical at times, and intentionally asks you to suspend reality, the plot is as deep as you want it to be. Simple good guy, bad guy movie....... or a story of how the establishment denigrates the value of the individual in order to meet its greater need. Easy to watch, lots of guys to like or hate, Murphys struggle to regain his \"self\" is there all along. More than meets the eye........as Emil says,\"I like it!\"" "RoboCop is perhaps my favorite of all movies. It's a dark, and darkly humorous, modern sci-fi classic, much deeper in pathos and drama than a film with a comic book name like \"RoboCop\" would lead you to believe. The bad guys are over the top and the hero is worth rooting for. The main thing I just wanted to say is: Don't listen to the \"recommendation\" to see RoboCop 2!!! Done by a totally director and group of writers, it doesn't have the soul-driven touch of Paul Verhoeven, nor the wry humor of the Miner and Neumeier, and is, quite frankly, an awful awful movie. You're better off watching reruns of the RoboCop tv show on the Sci-Fi channel because that series is actually created by the original writers and it ignores the events of any of the RoboCop sequels." "This movie was so cool! Fully packed with action and fun! This movie's got it all, from gas stations blowing up to a guy melting after a toxic waste bath. Robocop is just so cool, he's like a walking wrecking crew. This movie had a good plot, great characters, solid acting a lot of one liners and funny scenes. Good job by Weller, I especially like how he handled the two guys harassing the girl. Peter Weller probably does a mean robot on the dance floor!" "as far as sci-fi/action movies go, this one is a work of pure genius. i still haven't seen any film since come close to the hybrid of extreme graphic violence and dark humor that this classic combined so seemlessly and effectively. the basic plot involves a good cop who is viciously shot down in the line of duty and resurrected from death's door as the cyborg Robocop. the violence in this film is extreme and graphic (the X-rated director's cut is even bloodier!) but isn't sold as exploitation. the movie is never meanspirited in it's tone and the humor elements elevate it to something other than a gore fest. the special effects, particulary the brilliant stop motion animation by f/x genius Phil Tippett, are fantastic and much better than the CGI effects that have become so commonplace in today's market. Director Paul Verhoeven brings the perfect touch to this material. the non-Verhoeven directed Robocop 2 was particulary mean and lacked the cool and quirky touch he brings to his films (such as Starship Troopers). the editing is also fluid and helps amplify the action scenes. the only thing that is a slight letdown is the ending, but after the energy expended in the other sections of the film, this fault is acceptable and doesn't detract TOO much. a violent classic that has yet to be equaled. rating:9.5" "This movie rocks. This is one of the best Sci-fi action movies ever...it's even better than The Matrix. Peter Weller gives a gripping performance as Alex Murphy, a maverick cop who gets gunned down in the line of duty and is resurrected by a shady Industry as Robocop, the ultimate crime fighter. But when his memory begins to resurface, he sets out on a do-or-die mission of vengeance and justice. Loaded with great action sequences and unexpectedly moving, this film is a true epic." "I was very excited when I had the opportunity to watch this film on TV. I was so interested and fascinated in the \"robocop\" idea. Yes, it was a confusing and fascinating idea. \"The Old Detroit\" has been covered by the shadow of crime, its police department has been losing cops everyday, now they are about to strike, and even worse, the police are run by a corporation called OCP. Dick Jones (Ronny Cox) of the company has a cyborg cop plan- Ed 209, which is a failure and Jones is in fact secretly connected with the head criminal of Old Detroit, Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith). Meanwhile, Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer) who also works for OCP, who is young, ambitious, has another better project about building a part human, part machine cop. \"Now we're waiting for a foolish volunteer\", he says. Officer Alex J. Murphy (Peter Weller) has been just transferred from the south precinct to the west precinct and becomes the partner of Officer Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen). While chasing a group of bank robbers they goes to a steel factory, Lewis is hit and faints, and Murphy is savagely shot dead by the gangsters. His body is being used by OCP and he becomes the half man, half machine \"robocop\". Apparently robocop seems to be a better kind of police officer to \"uphold the law\" and to \"protect the innocent\" in the future, but as a matter of fact, he is only a tool for the corporation to pursue more power. The part which \"robocop\" goes back to Murphy's home really moved me. He realizes that the house is empty and his wife and son are gone (Obviously the people in charge haven't blanked his memory successfully). All in all there are a lot of stunning action scenes in this film (Although I still don't understand why those people want to make a part human robocop instead of a complete robot). And I feel truly sorry for Murphy's pathetic fate. Nancy Allen as a sympathetic police officer who helps Murphy rediscover who he really is." "This movie is in with other classics such as with Aliens and The Terminator movies. A science fiction action movie about the near future when the police force is run by corporations. The film is funny with lots of great one liners like \"Dead or Alive, your coming with me.\" It also makes fun of stuff like cars with awful gas mileage. The 6000 SUX. :) Unfortunately, that is not far from the truth. Featuring great special affects for then, they are now cheesy and outdated, but it really dosen't matter that much. This is a great classic, and I recommend you see it soon. But be forewarned, it is such a violent movie that it was first rated X, for violence. There is hardly any sex in it. Someone gets run over, stabbed, it's all in there. Just imagine the Matrix with blood and guts. Then your getting the idea.." "Before FIGHT CLUB satirized the corporate gluttony of America, the last great movie to hold a mirror up to American society was ROBOCOP, and a great many people hate this movie, because it's a satire about our commercial and material-obessed culture. For example: ED 209 pokes fun at overpriced military weapons systems that don't work, its just an excuse to spend money, because if the military doesn't spend all of their alloted budget, then they don't get the same amount of money to work with. The SUX 6000 car that gets 6 miles to the gallon or something like that needs no explanation! \"Does it get cruise control?!?\" Don't forget the infamous TV commercials for the heart transplant machine and the \"nuke 'em\" home game. The efforts of OCP to tear down old Detroit, i.e. the mostly minority inhabited inner city is a perfect example of what happened in New York City around Times Square. The Mayors office would like you to believe they cleaned up the city, but homelessness, prostitution and drug use are as rampant as ever, they've just gotten better at hiding it, much like the \"Silver City\" of Robocop was really nothing more than a very expensive paint job. What's brilliant about Robocop is that they've managed to make a smart, funny movie all the while incorporating great action sequences. A movie like this doesn't work without over the top villains, and Ronny Cox and Kurthwood Smith are happy to oblige, and to a more sinister, subtler extent so is the great character actor Dan O'Herily."

"This is probably the most daring Hollywood film of the last 20 years, but the success of its method is questionable. It attempts to expose the fascism inherent in modern American life. This is an admirable aim. The method it uses though is equally fascist. On the one level it succeeds - we are left in no doubt that there's something rotten in the state of Denmark. There are some brilliant, if obvious, observations about post-modernism, corporate greed, and Cronenbergian man/machine erotics. But the actual plot and sensual pleasure of the film is quite fascist too, and I certainly didn't feel enough distance from my pleasure and the implications of it. Of course, that is my fault. Whoops." "Despite being an ultra-violent sci-fi action picture with comic-book violence and dark humorous overtones, the storyline in RoboCop is almost Shakespearian in style. The plot is a vague retelling of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein with a computer-age twist. The late Officer Alex Murphy returns as a cybernetic revenant to avenge his own murder, and at the same time struggles with his own monstrous nature. I rank RoboCop among the top 10 science fiction films of all time for its poignant if unsubtle social commentary on the 80s, its storyline, and of course, the special effects. The acting is effective for the genre. Kurtwood Smith is outstanding as the evil gang leader. Most of all I liked RoboCop because it is the only time I can remember actually being scared in the theater. It scared me even more the second time I saw it even though I knew what was coming. A word about the violence: This may be the most violent film ever made. I understand that when the MPAA originally rated it, it received an 'X' rating -- the first film ever to get an 'X' rating for *violence*. A few scenes got clipped to get down to an 'R', but those scenes are restored in the director's cut. I think this is Verhoeven's masterpiece, and I'm proud to have it in my collection." "When i first watched this film it was in the same league as \"THE TERMINATOR\" and still is its an action packed vision of the future run by evil buisness men its got humor and the catchy one liners, some bits in gore especially the dvd which has everything and the feel sorry for the cop bit aswell as he regains his past memories and the short evil bad guy with his gang. It was followed by an ok sequel a bad prequel and an even worse tv series but i strongly recommend you see this film." "A good sci-fi movie that takes a satirical view of the corporate world and the sad direction our society is taking. This movie did seem too violent at times (like when Murphy gets blown to bits at point blank range) but I have to say this is one of my favourite movies of all time. It would be sweet to see this movie's special FX redone with todays CGI tecnology. I found the robot special FX blah but for its time I suppose it was good. The story though was top notch. I also found the \"I'll buy that for a dollar\" spoof pretty comparable to some of todays crap like jerry springer, etc etc. Just another example of where our society is heading I suppose." "RoboCop is a great film. The other two Robo-films don't come close to the original. Probably still one of the darkest, most violent movies I have ever seen - yet its still rather charming. The dark humour and one-liners are movie magic. Rent this film, its a classic. *****" "Robocop is a great movie which you already know i think. Well, anyways I this movie is even better on dvd. More overkill yes a quality that made the movie so good. This movie is well acted and has a good plot which is rare for and action well scfi/action movie i guess youd call it but i was surprised i was expecting a shoot em up bang action movie but what i got was a masterpiece." "Robocop is just one of those movies you will never get tired of. It established Paul Verhoeven, my favorite director, as a Hollywood filmmaker, and gave the US a taste of the Dutch director's style. The whole recklessness of it all appeals greatly to me, and that is why this is on my top ten action movie list of all time, it's great! The SFX are mind-blowing, especially for 1987! The only criticism I have of the film, is that the really cool scenes all happened in daylight. There weren't any exceptionally exciting action scenes at night, and you have to have one of those in a great shoot-em-up these days. All in all, this is a great movie, with a little bit taken from the Terminator, but a great plot of its own, and enough blood to fill two movies. Oh, yeah, almost forgot. \"Dead or alive, you're coming with me,\" is the greatest one-liner ever; in any movie! Peter Weller is perfect as Robo, and Ronny Cox the perfect 'behind it all' bad guy. Thumbs way up!" "This is probably the best robot film of all time, I just kept laughing the whole movie. When Kenny gets shot by ED-209, when Murphy gets killed, when the thug gets shot in the groin, they were all great death scenes. I couldn't stop laughing when Clarence said, \"Well, give the man a hand!\" after he blew Murphy's hand off. Kurtwood Smith played the best villain I have ever seen in a movie. Right down to the beady little glasses it reminds me of Hitler. The only problem I have is the plot holes in it. What was the purpose of the food Robocop was supposed to eat? He doesn't have a butt now, so how is he going to crap it out? I sure hope it doesn't build up in his stomach and when he is saying a criminals rights it comes out of his mouth like vomit. Another plot hole is the skin on Robocop's head. Since Robocop isn't really a living thing, wouldn't the flesh rot after a while? I sure hope they keep a bottle of fly spray in the police office. The last problem I have is how did Robocop remember his former life? Didn't they blank his memory? They probably hit his head with a hammer and said, \"That's it!\"" "For all its almost cartoonish violence and grim theme, RoboCop is an extraordinarily prescient satire of the levels to which society can, and in some cases already has, degenerated. From runaway corporate greed to preposterous three-shift-class cocaine processing plants, RoboCop only missed becoming a seminal warning piece because far too many people were satisfied with it as merely an action film. Nonetheless, repeat viewings only strengthen this film, and make its sequels that much more tragically bad. \"I'd buy that for a dollar!\"" "A truly superb science fiction action movie which has become a modern day classic. ROBOCOP centres around a police officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) in Detroit in the not so distant future who is brutally gunned down and later rebuilt as a cyborg by OCP (the company who 'owns' the police) as part of an experiment. As well as an original idea, a good cast and admirable special effects (for 1987) the film also has a strong story to it. Weller is okay in the title role while standouts are Miguel Ferrer as ROBOCOP's creator and Kurtwood Smith who relishes his role as chief bad guy Clarence Bodicker. Absolutely great stuff, however many times you have seen it, it's just a shame that it spawned such awful sequels and a laughably cheap cash in of a TV series. \"Your move Creep..\"" "Add another review" "Find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your Watchlist and rate your favorite movies and TV shows on your phone or tablet!")("Movies, TV & Showtimes" "Celebs, Events & Photos" "News & Community" "Watchlist" "" "Find industry contacts & talent representation" "Manage your photos, credits, & more" "Showcase yourself on IMDb & Amazon" "Sign in with Facebook Other Sign in options" "Own the rights?" "Having recently acquired the director's cut of Robocop. I got a sneaking suspicion that I wouldn't like it half as much as I did when I was 15. I've always defended this story of a future world where even the police force is run by a corrupt corporation. Murphy, a dedicated cop, is killed by a gang of criminals, and his body is soon transformed into an experimental cyborg policeman. But can the corporation who built him totally erase his past? Will the bad guys just keep on getting badder, and will the corporation delve deeper into corruption? I don't think we need two guesses at the answers to these questions! There's something quaintly old fashioned about Robocop. Peter Weller's moral cop/robot reminds me of various figures from old Westerns, but in most other respects the film is very much a product of it's time. The themes addressed are the themes of the 80s - TV, nuclear war, globalisation, urban violence, etc. Watching Robocop again makes you realise that all these issues are still with us - we're just so used to having them presented to us through highly paid spin doctors that we don't see them for what they are. Is Robocop's Omni Consumer Products really so far away from the enormous media and consumer conglomerations that have formed in the 12 years since it was released? As much as Verhoeven would like us to read such deeper issues into the film, it doubtlessly works best on a much simpler level. As an 80s action flick, it has few parallels, being exceptionally well made, exceptionally violent (especially the director's cut) and almost, but not quite, as entertaining as it was when I was 15. The casual blasting away of the bad guys may cause a few fascist, right-wing alarm bells to ring in my head these days, but it's a solid bit of fun while it lasts. The acting is generally decent, and the dialogue passable, but some of the effects seem very dated now - indeed, I seem to recall they looked pretty bad in 1987 too! I may no longer consider it to be quite as important a film these days, but it'll still go down well if I'm in the right mood. And there are many scenes that anyone who sees it will always remember - the melting man anyone? I guess that, had Verhoeven toned down his message and his delivery somewhat, then Robocop may have been just another routine video rental. Maybe his blunt style can be an asset after all...(!)" "When I was younger i had three favorite movies. '' TMN Turtles '', '' Conan '' and '' RoboCop ''. I thought RoboCop was too cool to be true. And i still think so. Complaining about the voilence and the blood is stupid. It's after all a '' Shoot em up-movie '' ( new kind of word ). And this is also a classic movie for every actionfans. I am not an actionfan. I can watch any kind of movie. It could be action, drama, romance, sci-fi, adventure, war movies, you name it. So I give this movie a well deserved * * * ½ out of five and 7 out of 10. '' Dead or alive you're coming with me ''." "RoboCop could have been the start of a great franchise. Instead the brand name piffled-out after the sequel and has since languished in the hell of TV shows, animated TV shows and mini-series crap. Paul Verhoeven's multi-layered original provided a platform for so much potential and possibility, it's a shame we only got 2 good movies out of it. Alex Murphy is a deeply unlucky cop who has transferred into Detroit's (actually Dallas) worst precinct. On his first day on the job he is gunned down by the stupendously evil Clarence Boddicker (a brilliant turn by Kurtwood Smith) and his gang of nasty thugs. Resurrected as some kind of Frankenstien/Christ figure, Murphy returns as RoboCop-The Future of Law Enforcement. In the world of RoboCop big business rules and public servants can be bought as stock (doesn't sound so unrealistic does it?). A super-conglomerate called Omni Consumer Products has entered into an agreement to fund and run the Detroit Police Force. Wishing to create a cop who doesn't need to eat or sleep they have a choice of pursuing the RoboCop idea or going with Vice President, Dick Jones' idea of ED-209, a mech-like twin cannon on legs. The CEO goes with RoboCop, leaving Jones with a personal vendetta against poor Robo. It may have been satire back in 1987 but today we are all to used to doomsday news being delivered by smile by our news anchors only to cut to an ad feature some violent video game or movie. The violence, social commentary and horror of RoboCop can sometimes pale in comparison to real life. When you're 7 years old, RoboCop is probably just the most amazing thing ever. I swear, I must have seen this film about 100 times when I was a kid. I was word-perfect on it. Even erm...note-perfect on Basil Poledouris' awesome, awesome score.I guess it's kind of unfair on kids these days that they are raised on braindead PG-13 crap while I got one bloody action movie after another back in the 80s. RoboCop is no doubt a classic. It's a shame it had such an indignant death. Still, I guess this is still a chance for re-resurrection. But please...no remake!" "Robocop is a great sci-fi movie. It has lots of blood in it. The acting is great. The story is great. The special effects are great. This movie kicks a**! Robocop never showed mercy to his enemies in the warehouse scene. The movie has great bad guys. Get it for DVD." "All cinema lovers get to place one guilty pleasure on their all time favourites list. Robocop is mine. Here we have a violent sci-fi film, steeped in self-parody, which still gives us one of movies great villains. No action flick works without a convincing villain and Kurtwood Smith's turn as Clarence Boddicker is perfect. He portrays a career criminal who sells drugs because its a business - he makes no other pretense and the movie does not waste our time trying to show his tortured past or making him into a closet junkie. More than anything, Robocop is a satire. The movie paints this bleak futuristic world (although we are never told that it is in the future) punctuated with sugar-coated \"everything's A-OK\" news casts and TV commercials for artificial heart transplants and a board game called Nuke'em. The entire premise of \"OCP\", the company who has privatized just about every not-for-profit public service, is far-fetched. But it works because the viewer can envision it happening, and because the movie drops you unabashedly into this incredible world. Also pay close attention to the old DOS commands that are displayed when the camera views from inside Robocop's visor. Its a throw-back to the first PCs. Director Paul Verhoeven fills the screen with so many wonderful enjoyable images, and works a plot so subtle that you may well miss most of the symbolism the first time around. This is a movie worth viewing over and over. The only knock on this film for me is that is gave way to two of the most horrid sequels ever made. Avoid them at all costs. **** out of ****." "I have a special place in my heart for mid-to-late eighties actioners (Predator, Beverly Hills Cop, Midnight Run, Commando, Lethal Weapon, Die Hard etc.) - they don't make them like they used to. For some reason, late 90s actioners are so lame and trepid - like Speed 2, Daylight, Cliffhanger, Lethal Weapon 4, Twister, GoldenEye etc. Bring back McTiernan, Shane Black, Tony Scott (Enemy Of The State leans too much onto the spy side of things) and let's not forget Paul Verhoen, whose RoboCop is a defining eighties actioner. What separates RoboCop from most other actioners is the world it's set in, in the 'near' future. It's not typically post-apocalyptic or terribly grim as most films show it to be, but shown to be PURELY run by money. It's a place where big corporations run the public services, and let criminals do as they please - like a never-ending riot. The situation is so extreme, you have newsreporters making fun of some of their stories - like a crisis in a third world country. To the hardcore shoot 'em up fan, one would probably not notice this as I had on first viewing, but it proves to be a thought-provoking setting and situation. RoboCop has a great cast. Ronny Cox and Miguel Ferrer are absloutely superb as rival business executives of OCP, a big corporation whose moniker and logo are seen throughout the film frequently since this is the company that owns EVERYTHING. The rivalry is so well played out, though I don't think it has much to do with the chief plot. Weller, whose full face is rarely seen in the film, does a good job as RoboCop/Alex Murphy. The shootouts, which are pretty much all the action scenes, are well choreographed and entertaining. I especially like the scene in which RoboCop marches into a warehouse, taking out badguys left, right and centre. And his one-on-one with ED-209 robot. Finally, I must confess that the ED-209 law enforcement unit was one of the scariest things I'd ever seen. With a horrifying montonous tone and a facist programme of operation, I really was scared in seeing it mercilessly shoot a junior executive to smithereens. The line - 'YOU HAVE FIFTEEN SECONDS TO COMPLY' - I shiver in fear when I hear that. I have a fascination for eighties films - especially ones that are action and 'very eighties' and so I love RoboCop." "Robocop is Paul Verhoeven's best film! Truly exciting, funny, dramatic, and action packed. Thankfully, now there is a director's cut on laserdisc and DVD, which has restored cuts which were removed to avoid an X rating. I watched it, and personally, I think the MPAA was very uptight in their decision. The cuts desperately needed to be there. The overall feeling and impact was changed to what it needed to be. For example, in the scene where police officer Murphy was murdered, he seemed just like an unlucky victim to a \"firing squadron\". In the director's cut, it is almost painful to watch! It not only makes his death memorable and pitiful, but it throws a dark shadow over the film that never leaves you. Even when Robocop was in the stages of being built, that murder scene was always in the back of my mind. It was so much more powerful, and set up a conflict between Murphy and the criminals which pays off at the end of the film. The director's cut isn't even a minute longer than its predecessor, and yet, it is a stronger version of the movie. It's great! But beware, it's not for the squeamish! Those of you who have seen the director's cut know exactly what I'm talking about." "Despite yet more blood guts and violence from Paul Verhoven, I was stunned when I first saw Robocop. At first I was captured by the non-stop violence but on more recent viewings I am caught deep in the storyline about a cop who has his life ripped from him and replaced by that of violence. I think people should forget Verhoven's reputation of sex and violence in his films as they are just his way of portraying an amazing story." "Called by Ken Russell \"the greatest science-fiction film since Metropolis,\" controversial director Paul Verhoeven's ROBOCOP is a special effects-laden cult phenomenon. The film features a resurrected and roboticized hero in a new, supercharged cyborg body, struggling to reclaim his memory and avenge his own death.Robocop looks into the future with a combination of fear and humor. It is a world clearly projected from the time it was made--the excessive 80's--and gives us a place where corporations control everything, even the public departments like the police. Cops no longer serve the public, they are pawns in a corporate game.Paul Verhoeven did a modern classic and a staple of science fiction. This movie is reckless disregard for human life and public property but still a great action-sci-fi classic and if you like Paul Verhoeven works do not miss this one......" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "If you revisit some of the sci-fi movies of the Seventies and Eighties like \"Star Wars\" and this one, you realize just how clunky some of the special effects were. As an example, you would think the designer of an attack droid would have given some thought to the idea that maybe it would eventually encounter a set of stairs at some point. When that attack droid flipped and started flailing it's legs it looked just hilarious. So it's 2014 now, some twenty seven years since this movie came out, and old Detroit still hasn't been replaced. You'd think they would put a whole army of Robocops in there to straighten things out. Actually, the way things are going, we may not be far from it what with flying drones being unleashed across the country and government surveillance at an all time high. Sure wish we could turn that clock back. Well I saw this when it first came out and again just the other day. Not much has changed in my perception of the flick; it's an entertaining blend of sci-fi and action with all manner of corporate outlaws looking to make a score with the latest in technology. Peter Weller is outstanding in the Robocop get-up, I was particularly amused each time he did one of those awkward twists with his head to signal a new direction he was going in. Ron Cox was perfect as the number two man at Omni Consumer Products, but he probably should have thought things through a bit more with his programming team. If all it took to get knocked out of the picture was getting fired, why wouldn't he simply design Robocop not to harm him under any circumstances. Pretty simple solution really. Say, how did the Robocop armor get fixed up every time he got shot up? That's what I'd like to know."

"In the last several years, Hollywood has made a habit of remaking, 'sequeling', 'prequeling' and rebooting anything they can get their greedy hands on. These unnecessary spin-offs rarely work as quality movies, but apparently they are very profitable. Long story short, this year (among other things) we will get a remake of the 1987 Action/Sci-Fi classic RoboCop. Although I strongly oppose remaking RoboCop (but I oppose remakes in general), this review wasn't meant to serve as criticism of the remake, but as a look back to, and a glorification of, the original movie. I will be tackling the remake when it is released, of course. In spite of being considered a classic action movie today, back in the day almost every big director passed on the opportunity of directing RoboCop  before Paul Verhoeven eventually settled as the director; and he also would have passed the opportunity if it weren't for a pleasant turn of events of his wife reading the script and convincing him to direct it. The reason I'm mentioning this is because Paul Verhoeven is the ideal director for such a movie, and if it weren't for him, I doubt RoboCop would have achieved the cult status it has. But I'll get to that in a moment. 'RoboCop' is set in a futuristic/dystopian version of the city of Detroit, which has a big problem with crime, and the police can't seem to do a thing. The police's main problem is one Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith), who is a notorious cop killer and the crime boss of 'Old Detroit'. Besides him, the police has trouble dealing with Omni Consumer Products (OCP), a company which signed a contract with the city that puts them in charge of controlling the city's security and police department. As an attempt at decreasing the city's crime rate, OCP has been developing some weapon programs  amidst which is a certain Robocop program, that would create a cyborg super cop who could easily deal with the troublesome crime rate. Luckily for them, a cop named Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) gets killed on duty, and they decide to run the prototype of the Robocop program using his dead body. To be honest, the concept of the movie does sound a bit ridiculous (which might explain why everyone passed the opportunity of directing it), but that's exactly why Paul Verhoeven is the perfect choice for directing it. He easily manages to turn the source material upside down and create something that is, at the same time, excessively violent, funny and satirical. And in that way 'RoboCop' isn't much different from Verhoeven's 1997 underrated gem Starship Troopers. His subtle director trademarks (the commercials in the movie and the religious imagery) are precisely what makes 'RoboCop' a good movie that stands out from other/similar action movies. Furthermore, Verhoeven directing is absolutely brilliant (the scenes in which RoboCop gets revealed come to mind) and he puts just the right amount of excessive, sometimes cartoonish, violence in the movie, in order not to avoid the campiness of the movie's premise. All of this makes 'RoboCop' a very unique and enjoyable experience which wouldn't have been possible without Verhoeven. Of course, not all of 'RoboCop' is Verhoeven's one man show. Props should be given to the people who designed the suit and to Kurtwood Smith, who plays the villain  Clarence Boddicker. His Boddicker is menacing, unpredictable and crazy, and the rule 'each film is only as good as its villain' undoubtedly works for 'RoboCop'. The only minor flaws that could be attributed to 'RoboCop' are that some of the special effects are really outdated, and that Peter Weller's role in the movie is unusually small, in spite of him being the titular character: he doesn't do much in terms of acting (more flashbacks could have helped with that problem). But I understand that some people may consider these as nitpicks. Finally, just like the old saying goes  'if it ain't broke, don't fix it'. Got that, Hollywood? Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/" "This film from the eighties still packs quite a punch, it doesn't seem to have dated at all; the action is still as exciting as ever and there are still scenes where I want to look away. Set in the crime ridden Detroit of the near future Peter Weller plays Officer Murphy who has just been transferred to one of the roughest precincts in the city. He is partnered with Officer Lewis, played by Nancy Allen. Unfortunately for him he is soon shot and left clinically dead. At this point OCP, a company that is running the privatised police force and has hopes to rebuild Detroit, steps in and replaces most of his body with cybernetic parts and erases his memory. Once back on the job he quickly makes an impression as he apprehends several criminals but all is not working according to OCP's plan as he starts to dream about his past life and then begins to search for those responsible for his death. This film fits in several genres: crime, Sci-fi, action, Dystopia, black comedy... if you are a fan of any it is worth watching, the acting is good through out as are the special effects, no obvious CGI like many of today's films. It is surprising that this isn't as well known these days as films like \"The Terminator\" and \"Die Hard\", I suspect it is due to the fact that the sequels were noticeably inferior to this." "I liked it more as an action movie than a sci-fi satire. The violence was suitably brutal and the action was fairly terrific, but the satiric elements were pretty mild and not as biting as I expected. It seemed to work better as a cheezy B-movie than anything else. Murphy's execution scene could be the most gruesome and horrifying scene I've ever seen, not just because of the gore but because of the context. It just disturbed me, something that doesn't happen a lot. Weller is fine - for a cyborg - but this film is all about Kurtwood Smith. Probably one of the best villain performances ever. The rest of the film is fairly mediocre; on the whole, it's entertaining and quotable, but not really deep or meaningful." "I am a huge fan of Robocop. I was about 7 or 8 when i first saw the films and i loved them and not because of the graphic violence or high levels of swearing! I have continued to watch them to this day and still never get bored of them. Sublime. People often ignore the next 2, they were still mighty fine even if not as good. If you are a true Robo fan, you wont have failed to notice the TV series, which again, will never be a match to the movies, is still top class cause at the end of the day, its Robocop. Its not just the sci-fi or violence, he's a guy with a heart and its the true story and later successes that make the movies what they are. Probably, my favourite line has got to be the famous \"Stay out of trouble\". Peter Weller was just incredible and i would welcome any day a fourth, a fifth and even a sixth. As is said before, its not the violence i liked. At times, particularly toward the latter stages of the picture, it gets quite comical, you know, the bit at the old sludge plant. I actually disliked the extent to which Verhoeven deemed it necessary to portray Murphy's downfall. Nonetheless, there are many clever elements incorporated into Murphy's legacy. These include the supporting cast, the stuff he says and the side issues of the regeneration of Delta City and the idea of Omni Comsumer Products. Its not just a case of cops chasing the bad guys, as Verhoeven was successful in showing. I loved the characters of Sgt. Reed and Mr. Kurt Smith who played a very believable fugitive in a corrupt Delta City. Finally, the ending \"Nice shooting, what's you're name\" and Robo replies with Murphy before closing on the end credits, with some of the greatest ever movie music ever, by Basil Poledouris. Absolutely Superb!" "Robocop is every man's fantasy film. We have action, gore, boobs, car chases, and some comedy thrown in. Peter Weller is great as Murphy, the cop who gets wasted by Clarence (Kurtwood Smith who looks like Lee Bowles) and turned into Robocop. It would have been nice to see Karen Allen naked but alas she isn't. Check out Carrie if you want to see her wool (I'll buy that for a dollar!). Get the unrated version of Robocop so you can see all of Rob Bottin's excellent make up effects." "Let me just say, I like this film alot, but there are some problems I have with it. First of all: I would have liked to see Murphy more as a human. We dont get to see him much that way. It would have been nice, if the story had taken the time needed to show us more of Murphys life as a human. It would have been better. The other problem I have is Murphys death. What leads up to it, two cops dumb enough not to wait for backup and go in to take on a large number of triggerhappy badguys, that alone is unbelievable. And Murphy calling Clarence slime, when he got 5 or 6 men pointing guns at him, seems pretty dumb too. Hes asking for it. But stil, the way they keep on shooting him over and over again. And it never seems to end. Of course in real life he would have been dead on the floor, long before they had run out of ammo. Before Clarence blew his brains out. Nobody can survive to be shot that many times. But the way he stands there and screams in pain as they just pump him full of bullits. Its too much and unnessecary. Of course, every time he kills one of the psychoes that blew him away, it feels really good, but they could have killed him in a less violent way. If instead they had just beat him up and then shot him in the head instead, then it would have been easier to watch. If not, at least Lewis could have shot the badguys. Or some of them. They never bothered to kill her before they left and they knew she was there. She might not have made it, but she could have saved Murphys life. Also, the movie never deals with Murphys life as a machine. Imagine waking up and your body is gone. Its been replaced by a mechanical body. Youve lost your penis. You can never make love to a woman again, you can never even have a girlfriend. Murphy has lost his body, his wife and his son. And probably his relatives too. And it never makes him lose his mind. That he doesnt kill himself is unrealistic. I know this movie is not suppose to be taken seriously, but it does deal with Murphys loss. And yet, it doesnt deal with it enough. It would have been interested if they had made a different movie where Murphy does get shot, but survives after surgery. A regular copmovie where he goes out with Lewis and kills all the men that shot him. Or they could have made Lewis into Robocop and Murphy as her human partner." "The 1980s had more bad science fiction movies than I can count. Some of these science fiction movies were bad and yet entertaining while others were just plain bad. ROBOCOP was one of those rare science fiction movies that actually didn't suck. It was good. Really good. It's a movie that I have seen at least ten times and I am proud to say that is one of my favorites. The directing is great, the writing is great, everything about the movie is great. The sequel, ROBOCOP 2, is good, but not quite as good as this one. Avoid the second sequel, ROBOCOP 3, at all costs." "Robocop (1987) was an thrilling science fiction comic book movie from Paul Verhoven. It's also a hard hitting satire at a society driven by consumerism, ultra right wing politics and a collapse from within. Crime is at an all time high,poverty is rampant, the streets are a war zone and the police department is being run by a corporation who only cares about the bottom dollar. During one incident, a decorated police officer named Murphy and his partner were in pursuit of a gang of ruthless bank robbers, during a bloody firefight and encounter Murphy is mortally wounded. Meanwhile O.C.P. is looking to implement their new super cop program but they need a involuntary volunteer for the job. Lo and behold they found one in Murphy. Will he be a successful candidate? Can Robocop do the job? Is there any light at the end of the tunnel? Will Robocop survive the rough streets of Detriot and save the day? Paul Weller stars as Officer Murphy, a candidate chosen to become part of the new Robocop program. Nancy Allen co-stars as his partner, Miguel Ferrer is the head of the project, Ronny Cox is his nemesis and board room rival. Kurtwood Smith is th leader of a gang of psychos and sociopaths. What makes the movie cool is the sheer graphic violence, witty dialog and a bunch of stand out characters. The direction is flawless and the cinematography is top notched. Verhoven and writer Edward Neumeir would work with each other again on the highly underrated science fiction flick Starship Troopers. Both films have the same criticism of conservative governments and societies. They're highly recommended and they can be seen together as companion pieces. Highest recommendation possible!" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This film begins in a dystopian future with the city of Detroit faced with a horrendous crime wave coupled with massive unemployment. As the story unfolds a cop by the name of \"Ajax J. Murphy\" (Peter Weller) is reassigned from one precinct within the city to the most difficult and crime-ridden area of all. To make things even worse a big corporation known as \"OCP\" has essentially taken over control of the police department and virtually dictate all policy and procedures. So when Murphy get shot and killed in the line-of-duty they take his body and transform him into a cyborg which gives him increased strength and gun accuracy but at the cost of a complete loss of memory. Also included in his transformation is a secret protocol known as the \"4th directive\" intended to benefit those within OCP. Although there isn't anything Murphy can do about this his memory begins to return to a limited degree when his partner \"Officer Anne Lewis\" (Nancy Allen) attempts to remind him of certain events just prior to his being killed. In the meantime, however, office politics within the corporation begin to become a bigger problem to Murphy than the armed criminals out on the street. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I remember watching this movie when it first came out and I continue to enjoy it to this day. Of course, it suffers a bit due to the passage of time but that is only to be expected. In any case, I encourage those interested in a movie of this type to check it out and I have rated it accordingly. Above average." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Be forewarned! A lot of blood, gore, bullets and swear words are in this film. That being said, a great concept film later turned into 2 uneven sequels, a 2014 remake, and a somewhat-successful TV series. So many errors and goofs which, for the most part, are mostly \"signage\" problems and techno-issues. I didn't have time to \"catch\" the rest of them as I was too busy watching the film. It is so obvious that this film wasn't filmed anywhere remotely near Detroit. There is even an out-of-state steel mill. Like all Verhoeven films, more big guns than imaginable. The depicted use of \"coke\" is totally inappropriate and the annoying \"I'd pay a dollar for that\" dirty-minded TV video gets old very fast. I love the fake news and tacky commercials. Peter Weller in that tin can suit looks very hot and sweaty! The \"rogue\" cyborg looks stop motion animated but that is before CGI. I am still surprised that there were no laser weapons. Some on the mattes are unconvincing. Somewhat better to watch on cable as the fowl language is greatly cleaned or cut. The acid-dissolving \"henchman\" would give any little kid nightmares. It's convenient that the dirty water dilutes it so that no one else dies that way! I also like (although not as much) Robocop 2."

"*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "The American baptism of Verhoeven is solved with an atypical and violent Sci-Fi film, in which subtle secrets are hidden that can be applied to both political and private organisms. The desire to put into the hands of the machines the security and comfort of citizen security was not a new idea, but the Dutch director knew to give a much more forceful turn in its development, in which the irony is part of a more visceral argument That intellectual. Thus Robocop begins in a future in which violence has reached such a degree that cities choose to delegate private security to citizens, which does not solve the problems of corruption but rather moves them to another area. The idea of ​​the perfect policeman comes from the fusion of what is left of a supposedly murdered policeman with mechanical devices that are supposed to make him invulnerable to criminal attacks. And crime is one of the expositions that best summarizes the film, since crime is directly linked to the corruption of those who are supposed to eradicate it. But it is not all Robocop-Frankenstein, although the director pursues a goal that goes a step beyond the merely commercial, does not turn the film into a trivial moralistic message, but it is a film in which his possible messages do not Interfere with the reality of a science fiction film with great doses of action. Thus, an atypical film was characterized by the insertion of advertising criticizing consumerism and the cold reaction of people to important problems such as pollution, health or ecology, deceitful corporative traps that far from seeking the solution to the social problems benefits from them. We see how the promoter of the first robot uses repressive and uncommunicative methods in the program installed in the machine, which in a first trial ends with the death of an executive whom they treat as if a setback was treated without showing the slightest feeling For the life of the unfortunate director, who the rest of the people urgently request an ambulance, something totally ridiculous after having received a whole countless arsenal of bullets. The creator of Robocop also does not escape the critic Verhoeven style, is a kind of Dr. Frankenstein who does not hesitate to treat a fallen policeman as a product owned by a company willing to experiment with the limits of the human mind, selfish and selfish, Its sole aim is equally the lust for power. \"Robocop\" is a generous film that hides pleasing surprises, which neither adorns violence nor treats it delicately, but shows the wild and selfish side of the times." "RoboCop (1987) is the finest cyberpunk action movie one of my favorite films of all time. I grew up with this movie, it has a special place in my heart and I love it to death. Here you have everything: brilliant story, good actors, stunts, puppetry, models, and good Special Effects. This is Paul Verhoeven and Peter Weller's best movie from the 80's they ever made. I used to had this movie on VHS but over the years the tape was eaten from VHS recorder so that I couldn't watch the movie properly anymore. 3 years earlier I got this movie on Blu-ray Unrated director's cut and my Blu-ray player scratched and eat the Blu-ray disc so I purchased the director's cut again on Blu-ray and I was blown away with the movie how good it is. RoboCop it's not an action in the film itself, that makes this be the case. This is especially odd in a movie with a $50 million budget (in 1987!), with multiple huge explosions, with hundreds of bullets fired, and scores of stuntmen used. 30 year's anniversary is coming in July since the movie was released and it is a shame that Miguel Ferrer aka Bob Morton died this year in January R.I.P. we miss you. This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task. The movie it self has heart and soul in it, the fact is you have a human being who loses his humanity and it brought back to life, he is resurrected and he is a superhuman super cop who once again regains his humanity and his trouble been robot and human. When Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) takes off his helmet we see a sad mourning man who lost everything. I felt really sorry for Alex who was shot and killed I was really moved and sad by his death who lost his family. Peter Weller stars in the film as Alex Murphy, a Detroit police officer who after being gunned down by a vicious gang, is resurrected by a mega-corporation as the cybernetic law enforcement officer of the future. As he begins his new life as \"RoboCop\", Murphy starts to regain a bit of his humanity with the help of his former partner Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen). The popularity of the RoboCop character would spawn a RoboCop franchise consisting of, among other media, two more feature films, a 1994 live-action series, two animated television series, a four-part movie miniseries as well as a 2014 remake. Actors Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, Ronny Cox, Kurtwood Smith and Miguel Ferrer do all job well and they deliver the movie as an entertaining action flick. I love the puppetry of droid ED-209 who has a lot of fire power and the costume and the suit for RoboCop was beautiful designed. Themes that make up the basis of RoboCop include media influence, gentrification, corruption, authoritarianism, greed, privatization, capitalism, identity, dystopia, and human nature. It is an rated R action film and I wish there would be movies like this today. I love the Music score by Basil Poledouris which it is my favorite score and it is a classic orchestra. The stunts are completely insane in scale (we have a lot of glass scenes like Ed-209 fires cannon guns on Robo and he flies trough glass door. Robo fires his gun on Dick (Ronnie Cox) and he flies trough window.) Robo punches a terrorist in mayor's office and he falls from the window. Of course, this wouldn't be an action movie without some action. There's plenty of it, and it's perfectly done. The gunplay is delivered in perfect Verhoeven style (as opposed to the slo-mo John Woo-style) -- you'll see lots of heavy automatic, shotguns and explosive cannon weapons, and you'll see them used well. The film is violent, and bloody with real blood squibs. It is also up to the script to deliver the real substance of the movie. (One often sees great performances in mediocre films... here the story transcends the performances -- an impressive feat.) The script delivers. The film is absolutely filled with great, classic moments (I counted TEN all-star ones during my last viewing), and they're evenly spaced through the movie. I love how RoboCop prevents two armed robberies, a rape which he shoots the rapist in the dick, he bust a drug factory on by him self, he stops and punches a terrorist and saves the hostages in the mayor office, he stops a violent gang by himself and he stops a corrupt business man. Best scene: ED-209 moves its right gun-arm cannon on RoboCop (Peter Weller) but Robo grabs it and shoves it away just before ED fires. ED continues firing as Robo shoves the gun towards ED's left gun-arm, destroying it. ED-209 fires one of its missiles at RoboCop. The missiles were actual rockets guided with wires. RoboCop (1987) is a classic one of the best action films my all time favorite action films of mine that defines my childhood. This movie has a heart, and that you cannot deny. Plus, it simply rocks. 10/10 RoboCop is a 1987 American cyberpunk action film directed by Paul Verhoeven and written by Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner. The film stars Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, Dan O'Herlihy, Kurtwood Smith, Miguel Ferrer, and Ronny Cox. 10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Orion Pictures Starring: Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, Daniel O'Herlihy, Ronny Cox, Kurtwood Smith, Miguel Ferrer, Robert DoQui, Ray Wise, Felton Perry, Paul McCrane, Jesse Goins, Calvin Jung, Lee de Broux Director: Paul Verhoeven Producer: Arne Schmidt Screenplay: Edward Neumeier, Michael Miner Rated: R Running Time: 1Hr. 42 Mins.

And I've never regretted that act of childhood disobedience. The film stars Peter Weller as the leading man/machine/cop and he takes It as the role of a life time. After being nearly killed by a group of criminals lead by Kurtwood Smith's Clarence Bodikker with Ronny Cox's Dick Jones playing Emperor Palpatine to Smith's Darth Vader, he then becomes RoboCop who eventually sets about avenging his own murder. What we then see whilst Murphy kicks ass, killing off criminal after criminal is his journey to finding some humanity again as he ... kills relentlessly. A different stretch of humanity, I'll give you that. But It is superbly cool to see him taking down low life criminals, right up until his most successful death of Bodikker and Dick Jones. What also makes an appearance in RoboCop is ED 209 which is also a bad ass robot, but he's aligned with Dick Jones. And between all of the kick ass action scenes we also get Nancy Allen's Lewis playing Murphy's partner whilst becoming equally bad ass herself. However despite the characters themselves, the highlight of the original RoboCop is definitely the action sequences, a lot of the time It actually feels like you're right there with Murphy as he drives through Detroit dishing out swift justice. To sum RoboCop up I'd have to call It one of my more watched action movies, with a simple but effective collection of elements to go with it." "RoboCop is an all time classic action film and one of the best of the 1980's, right up there with Die Hard in my opinion. Paul Verhoeven's career began here and even though he has made a lot of questionable choices and movies (including some down right stink fests) RoboCop still stands up as awesome. One underrated thing about this movie is Peter Weller's performance, he is great and never really got the credit he deserved for this or a lot of other movies to be honest. At least with Sons of Anarchy he seems to be getting some good work again, which is a good thing. The only downside is this movie is not for everyone, it was originally rated X for a reason and is incredibly bloody and violent, so no kids allowed!" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This is the best tale of revenge ever told - and also a satire about a world where a corporation acts as the State. The premise is that a corporation runs the police - and they make decisions that are based on profit and not public safety. As a result - they want to replace police officers with robots who may be less expensive - and their prototype is Robocop. The problem is - Robocop is really a dead police officer - who after a few successful busts begins to remember how he died and he decides to violate his programming to bring his killers to justice. The film asks- can humanism endure in the face of the State as a machine - when the human in question the machine of the State itself? This movie not only has a rad moral - it has a great soundtrack, groundbreaking violence, magnificent acting, and pristine special effects. The film contains some of the best lines ever delivered on screen - and stands the test of time as a masterpiece. My dad took me to this film when I was seven years old - and I will always remember the impact it had on me. Movies like this never get made anymore. Which is sad." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "I was a teen when Robocop was released in France (january 1988) and i remember to have been a fan with its concept and design while not having seen the movie actually ! I remember also reading the novelization, playing the arcade game and to keep on drawing the character ! But i don't remember how i watched it for the 1st time maybe later with pay TV Canal + and even today with my dad's DVD, it's still a remarkable anticipation movie : in fact, this movie predicted what America has become: cupid firms, silly medias, useless politicians, urban guns violence and devastated districts and for sure, enhanced humans with electronics ! What left me in awe every time i watch it is the quality of this near future (like BTTF2 very likely) and the visual virtuosity to tell the story : Robocop vision, its arrival, its unmasking (like Dath Vader), its dreams, all those moments are really inspired and proves Verhoeven as a highly talented director ! But he is not alone as Weller does a fantastic mime job to act like a robot (with a good help from a handful of TP cast) and Poledouris adds the essential musical soul ! Maybe Verhoeven is a bit too much equating Murphy-Roboop to Jesus but the thematic of the soul in a robot is interesting, all the more put in terms of Police law ! At last, the DVD has really good bonus, in particular the deleted scenes that offers a great alternate ending !" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "What makes this film such a classic is the way in which the standard, clichéd story (itself a mixture of Frankenstein-type moralising with a more teen-orientated shoot 'em up) is given greater depths as characters are fleshed out, given real relationships, and die violently at each other's hands. Director Paul Verhoeven paints a gory, violent depiction of the future, which will come as no surprise for those familiar with the director's mainstream work (namely TOTAL RECALL and STARSHIP TROOPERS). This can only be a plus. There are numerous action sequences in the film and Verhoeven sure knows how to handle the gunfire. As well as the bloodshed, the twists and turns in the plot really add to the intrigue and we even find ourselves caring for the characters as the lines of good and evil are blurred out. Along with the great supporting story, which is kind of a hybrid Frankenstein/revenge film set in the future, there is a powerful, dramatic and pounding score which I really loved. The acting is also good. Peter Weller is very memorable and works wonders in evoking our sympathy, especially as we can only see his lower jaw for much of the film. It's here he proved his worth as a straight lead man. Nancy Allen is quite good as his sympathetic partner, the only person who really understands Murphy. Among the baddies, Kurtwood Smith has playing a callous murderer down to a tee and Ronny Cox emanates pure, sweaty, corrupted greed and evil. The special effects really add to the film in many different forms; ED-209 the stop motion monster is especially impressive, as is Robocop's design (Rob Bottin deserves thanks once again here). Make up is also used effectively. It's interesting to see how Verhoeven uses the recurring theme of satire in his fake news reports, which are very similar to the ones in STARSHIP TROOPERS, and there is even a commercial designed by the insane Chioto Brothers. Along with the action are a number of comedic scenes, the best one being where one of the gang is dissolving in toxic waste before exploding when hit by a car! All of this makes the film well worth watching and it was popular enough to spawn two sequels (the first all right, the second, atrocious) and even a television series, all of which are not as good as the original (but then, when are they?)." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "With the newest remake of this eighties classic action movie been almost forgotten I thought it was high time to review the original splatter that has left such a legacy to our culture. First of all the movie is one of the most violent, vulgar and fun flicks in history and to add to that has a great commentary to the Cold War era madness as well as the total control the corporation have in our life. And all that was in a movie about a cyborg cop in nineteen eighty seven! For real if you seat down and think about it the film kinda predicted correctly the future. Let's see: 1) Corporation getting inside public organizations check. 2) Corporation making great plans with the aid of some unethical persons check. 3) Marketing death and destruction to kids check. 4) The media becoming just a mouthpieces of corporations to sell more and keep the public hooked with stupid cutesy quotes check. 5) Drugs check!!!! 6) Detroit becoming a crime infested area. Holly Batman, they got it quit close to the real deal! I am shocked to say the least by all that facts. In the end a must watch to any man who respect himself!! And for the women who like them , already got my respect!" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Peter Weller's performance goes beyond being in a Robocop costume. He manages to elicit a degree of sympathy, especially in trying to track his wife and son. That was quite moving. The Old Man, who is the CEO of the Robocop company, is played by Dan O'Herlihy, whose son is Gavan O'Herlihy who some may recall played Chuck, the eldest of the three Cunningham children in Happy Days. One standout performance is Paul McCrane, who has a classic scene at the end with the acid vat. Wow, he really lost his head there. Kurtwood Smith is also in Robocop, and he doesn't disappointed. I especially liked Kurtwood's performance in the short film 12:01." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "(Minor spoilers ahead) This movie is a major example of a film that works on almost all levels (but it is not for the squeamish). It works as pure entertainment, a reflection of society when capitalism goes overboard, a thoughtful look into the emotional torment of a man who's had everything taken from him, and a brutal, unforgiving bad ass revenge tale! And boy is that dish served cold! Sometime in the future, Detroit is overrun by vicious criminals. Drugs, prostitution, murder, and injustice are commonplace. Meanwhile, the city is taken over by the suits at OCP, a consumer products mega corporation that manufactures everything from basic consumer items to military weapons and robotics. They've also bought out local law enforcement, leaving many cops at the picket lines since the city owes the company $37 million after a bail out. OCP also secretly works with the city's most dangerous criminals when need be (for something to gain) and are about as corrupt as can be. Seeing as how crime is so rampant and out of control, OCP JR.CEO Dick Jones offers up big bad ED 209, a law enforcement droid who ends up making a bloody mess out of their own at a board meeting in the most extreme bullet ridden kind of way! Upcommer in the biz, Bob Morton sees this as his opportunity to go straight to the head CEO to upstage the seemingly corrupt Dick Jones. Enter Alex Murphy, a good man and heroic cop new to the Detroit metro south police force. Along with his new tough but warmhearted partner Anne Lewis, they are radioed in to go after Clarence Bodicker, one evil and messed criminal and his gang of psychopaths. These guys are some of the most straight up cruel, violet, savage, and vicious villains I've seen on film. After an exhilarating chase, Murphy is tortured, humiliated, and left for dead by the villains. Murphy is later rebuilt by OCP as Robocop. As Robocop he becomes an unstoppable warrior of justice handing out brutality to the brutal and protecting those who cant protect themselves. He slowly starts to regain his memories and goes after the scum who coldly and mercilessly killed him. Usually in movies when a villain brutally harms or kills our protagonist, the vengeance is not often as brutal or satisfactory. This is not the case! The revenge is cold as ice! But Clarence and his thugs are not the only ones. Murphy finds there is more going on behind the scenes then he expected. Can he stop it? How much of him is human and how far can he go? There are few movies I've loved just as much as a kid as I now love as an adult. This is one of the few. It is an incredible film, satisfying on so many levels. Don't let the goofy title or terrible 2014 remake fool you. This is the real deal. Awesome action, great story, and good old fashioned 1980s special effects that look real and not computer generated. Give it a look. You will not be disappointed! Just watch out for that toxic waste, melting scene in the climax. It is disturbing! So if quality action/SciFi cinema is your thing (or not), check this out and enjoy! \"YOUR MOVE, CREEP\"."

"\"B&@$es leave!!\" I direct that sentiment towards anyone out there who thinks the remake of Robocop can hold a candle to Paul Verhoeven's brilliant, incredibly graphic and bitingly satirical 1987 classic. Everything that was special and amazing about the original was absolutely urinated on with the remake, and it kills me that I run into people my age these days who aren't even aware that the remake IS a remake, and think it's the original Robocop. Ugh. Get out. No, this is the real, steel deal, accented by Verhoeven's blunt approach to characterization and overly ultraviolent, near Cronenberg-esque flair for carnage. Peter Weller only gets to act as regular joe police officer Alex Murphy for a brief and chaotic prologue, but makes the most of it with his deadpan delivery and piercing gaze. Murphy is assigned to a precinct in the heart of Old Detroit, a district so corrupt, rotten and infested with crime it literally resembles a war zone, and cops wear heavy riot gear on their beat. Paired Nancy Allen, he beelines it for a suspicious truck leaving the scene of a heist. Only one problem: this particular truck happens to belong to evil arch criminal Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith) and his merry band of psychopaths, who are armed to the teeth with heavy artillery. Cornered in a warehouse, Murphy is brutally, and I mean freaking brutally dispatched by Boddicker and his gang, shredded by a hail of gunfire that turns him into raw hamburger meat. What's left of him is quickly swooped up by corporate, and used in a high tech, absolutely silly program run by coked up suited opportunist Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer). His idea has gotten in the way of nefarious plans put in motion by the top dog of the company, a maniac named Dick Jones played by Ronny Cox in a frighteningly funny turn that makes you terrified in between fits of giggles. Once Murphy has been through Morton's wringer, Robocop emerges, an epic, unstoppable android enforcer who lays waste to criminal scum all over town, until traces of Murphy's consciousness bubble up past the circuit boards and he gets his own agenda. Jones is determind to take him down, along with Morton, undermining The Old Man (Daniel O'Herlihy), the acting CEO. For a film called Robocop that came out in 1987 you'd think were in for a cut and dry action cheese fest. Not with Verhoeven at the helm. The Dutch madman is never one to play it safe (a refreshing trait among European directors) and pulls out all the stops here for a bloody good time that pauses ever so slightly to nudge you with its cynical side that just loves to bash social convention into oblivion. The effects are so 80's you'll swoon, especially when Jones's own robo creation shows up in clanking, drunken stop motion that you can practically reach out and touch. Smith is a homicidal wonder as Boddicker, the smarmy fury and unrestrained behaviour hijacking every scene he's in. Leland Palmer himself, Ray Wise plays Leon Nash, his equally dastardly second in command, and a host of gnarly character actors back them up, all of which have curiously guest starred on Fox's 24 at various points in time, including Weller too. The level of f&@cks given with this film goes into the negative region of the thermometer, and to this day few studio films have been able to boast such disregard for discretion or lay claim to a sheer love of bombastic villains, a blatant lack of subtlety and a willingness to take things to cinematic infinity, beyond and back again just so they can throw a few more bullets into the mix. Accept no substitutes." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Robocop was released in 1987 starring Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, Kurtwood Smith and Ronny Cox. Just like the original Terminator movie this is an amazing movie full of gore and great violence that works in favor of the movie but also a really good script and unique movie for that time Weller as Alex Murphy A.k.a Robocop is really great and totally fits the part but also Kurtwood Smith as Boddiker he's amazing a really great villain and of course Ronny Cox as Dick Jones the actor was meant to play another villain 3 years after this movie was released in Total Recall (1990) directed by Paul Verhoven the director of this movie. The only problem i had with the movie is that in my opinion it's pretty short i wanted more violence and much more action but i'm OK with that and also the ED-209 which is a stop motion when it falls from the stairs it's kinda cheesy. Another great thing about this film is the soundtrack by Basilis Pouledouris which i think is amazing especially when the cops start shooting Murphy that was pretty hard to watch because you feel what the character has been threw loosing his wife, his son, his job but also his humanity. Just like Predator which also came out in 1987 the sequels weren't that awesome but i did liked the Remake it didn't try to copy the movie it was setting a new story and that is what i loved from it. In the end Robocop is easily one of the best movies ever made but also a great action science fiction movie that worked thanks to a talented director, great cast, amazing soundtrack and a very unique script for the time but also for it's R-Rating. P.S: The Trailer for the movie Robocop actually borrowed the theme of The Terminator (1984) and for some reason that was awesome!!!" "\"Robocop\" is a modern science fiction masterpiece. The future is not black and white, as most sci-fi tales conform to. It is a utopia of white-teeth propaganda but its black tarred heart beats a dystopian horror. \"Robocop\" has been misunderstood simply as an eighties violent action picture. It is a lot more than that. Peter Weller is an inspired choice for the dual role of Officer Murphy (married family man, nice suburban home) and his resurrected entity - Robocop. The armor suit is brilliantly created, and seems well ahead of its time - example the gun holster in his leg (this is pre-CGI). Nancy Allen, plays his side-kick who also holds a high moral compass. The story is simple, and therein lies its beauty. Paul Verhoeven is a master at creating visceral Science Fiction worlds brimming with originality, extreme violence, and sharp satirical humor. RoboCop is the perfect example. It is often hilarious, and equally thrilling. The violence is played up to an unrealistic level, making it difficult to take seriously (as you should not), yet even so, it may be a little much for the squeamish. The violence may have been a shocker back then, but by today's standards it's pretty standard, so I feel the over-the-top tone may go over some newer viewers' heads. Overall rating: 9 out of 10." "If a film can be considered perfect based on the presidents that it personally sets out to accomplish and it's achievement of doing so effortlessly, then the original Robocop might be as close to a perfect film as it gets! It knows that it want's to be an over-the-top, comically violent sci-fi action movie with a ridiculous premise, while simultaneously making fun of contemporary American consumerism in the 1980's. And it hits it's mark with precision only Robocop himself could have! The movie provides you with almost no wasted screen time; every scene serves its purpose in developing the story! Even when the action and the plot is interrupted by \"Media Breaks\" and hilarious satirical commercials, it doesn't waste your time and keeps you entertained and immersed in this dystopian view of Detroit. And while the movie is hard to take seriously based on the name and premise alone, it doesn't shy away from providing some very real human moments and deep emotions. The tone of the movie is all over the place, but the tone of each scene is never out of place, and it all seems to fit together. However, be forewarned before going into this film that this movie is excessively violent. It's not violent from start to finish necessarily, but there are scenes of people being shot 60 times in the chest with heavy weapons and a guy who's flesh melts after being drenched in toxic waste (which is arguable the funniest part of the movie). The violence can be a bit much at times, especially when we see the main protagonist brutally tortured with shotguns by a gang of criminals, but most of the scenes are so over-the-top that they become absurd and outright comical! Bottom line: this film earns it's R rating several times over, so be prepared! If you can stomach the ridiculous violence and gore, and can accept this film as what it is, then you will definitely enjoy Robocop! Just know what kind of movie you're getting into first." "This film is comparable to a fine wine or cheese. It gets better the more and more it ages. Robocop is Paul Verhoeven's greatest film (Close second Total Recall) of which both had terrible remakes. If you have not already seen Robocop I highly suggest it if you are a fan of either Total Recall or any good 80s violence fest, such as The Thing. It is no surprise that the ED-209 and Robocop are two icons of pop culture. Not the greatest film ever made, perfect at what it wants to do. Which is a violent crime action film with sci-fi elements. One of the best films to come out of the 80s." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This is a fun film, in the vein of classics like 'The terminator' and 'Total recall', though not that good. The story has some pretty good ideas in it, there's a lot of creative violence and gadgets, and the two leads, Peter Weller and Nancy Allen, really work well together. There's a good load of fun bad guys here as well, one of whom is Kurtwood 'foot in your ass' Smith. At times there are some lesser scenes, for instance, when that gang gets together shooting the really big guns just for fun - they're more like a bunch of kids there. But every time things are about to get a little too boring or too silly, things pick up pretty quick again. The stop-motion parts are a lot of fun as well, as is the (in itself somewhat off-handed) part with the toxic waste crash. As said, the story has some good ideas, but as a whole it wasn't all too convincing. Just a fun '80s sci-fi action ride, that's all - and that's fine! A good 7 out of 10." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Officer Alex Murphy is killed in the line of duty and then re-built by the \"Omni-Consumer-Products\" Corporation as robocop. Part man, Part machine, All Cop. Although released in 1987 it is set in an unspecified future. This movie is chock full of satire about 1980's culture and it has aged very well in my opinion. Sadly many of the attitudes displayed by some of the characters in this film have become true. Highly recommended. This original is much better than the 2014 \"Re-make\". I would have typed everything correctly but IMDb wouldn't allow it. They thought I was yelling. Go figure." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "I have to say, this was a pretty good movie, it wouldn't be a favorite but man, Robocop was a bad ass! I honestly wish I could have a suit like that so I can not worry about being shot by criminals but unfortunately, it's not real so I might as well suck it up to reality! I actually never came across this movie but I have heard of it throughout the years! I probably was the only person in the world to not have seen this since it has been proved quite popular! I was kinda bummed to hear that they made more abaptions to this like the sequel and rebooted this in 2014. I won't be planning to look at them but still, I was annoyed that Hollywood decided to kill the original movie! So yup, I loved the action and of course be aware of the blood or gore in this!" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Detroit police officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is critically wounded in the line of duty. A corporation struggling with public image bends its resources toward remaking Officer Murphy into a superhuman, cybernetic police officer. Robocop then proceeds to wear anal orifices for socks as he struggles with his humanity. In all, this movie is outstanding from a technical point of view. Nothing really failed and most of the technical aspects of film making succeeded beautifully for the time with the only hiccups being in the acting department. This is one of the rare examples of everything coming together just right in a product that is by no means Oscar-worthy. Personally I love this movie for its writing. It flows nicely with no ponderous slow spots and it packs so much into a relatively short time, from humanist themes to 1980s culture parody to criticizing corporatism and the whole time, delivering a narrative that is far from preachy and keeps you entertained. Movies just aren't written like this anymore. Granted, the plot is a bit campy, even for the 80s, but it was done very well. I would highly recommend this movie to watch because it is a good movie on technical merit, if you keep the time it was made in mind (which to me, is the only fair way to judge film)." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "RoboCop (1987): Dir: Paul Verhoeven / Cast: Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, Kurtwood Smith, Ronny Cox, Dan O'Herlihy: Overrated yet innovative action film about advance technology. Officer Murphy is shot to death but revived as partial robot to stop crime in Detroit but past memories soon surface causing him to pursue those who took his life. Well established plot becomes routine catering to a graphic action climax. Directed by Paul Verhoeven as his first major hit. He previously made the cult film Soldier of Orange. A big technical achievement with Peter Weller portraying the overwhelming crime stopping Robocop. Weller plays off a sense of loss and a sense of curiosity as he struggles to adapt to his new life. He soon realizes real benefits when it comes to dealing with crime. Nancy Allen as his partner is basically a cardboard female lead. Kurtwood Smith plays a convincing villain who actually is responsible for nearly dismantling Robocop when he and his gang shoot him up until he is able to find cover. Ronny Cox plays the standard issue villain whose defeat is less climatic than intended. Dan O'Herlihy plays a character called \"the old man\" perhaps because they are attempting to remind him that he has gray hair. While story is somewhat standard fare, Verhoeven does present a new kind of action hero. It demonstrates the possibilities and disadvantages of technology.

"I hadn't seen this movie in a hundred years, well since the 80's anyway but I'd always remembered that it was a good movie. I caught it again on TV the other night and went in expecting an absolute 80's cheesefest; with bad special effects and satirical bad guys but I was pleasantly surprised, this is still a good movie. Yes it is a bit dated now in terms of special effects and the super cool opening graphics but not as much as I was expecting and in terms of when this was made, its pretty brilliant. Lots of clever ideas, with an intelligent story disguised somewhat by action, gore and dark satire. Peter Weller does a fantastic job as Officer Alex Murphy, a Detroit police officer who is killed in the line of duty and then resurrected as a half human-half robot programed to serve justice at any cost -a quest that is often at odds with his thirst for revenge against the thugs that killed him. Weller manages to express a lot of emotion from under his mask and must have really worked on getting the robotic body language down, the jerkiness. I wound up feeling really sorry for his character. Lots of familiar faces amongst the business men and bad guys with Clarence Boddicker standing out as the perfect baddie, trying to kill 'Murphy (again). He spouts my favourite line from the movie upon entering Miguel Ferrer's cocaine party \"bitches leave\". There are also some funny ads (the Nuke-Em game) and ironic futuristic news clips. A movie worth checking out again, its stood the test of time. 6/23/15" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "The original Robocop is a film that I've seen several times now and no matter how many times I watch it it's a film that never loses its appeal with me. Anyone who is familiar with Verhoeven's work will know that he has a love for two things; satire and blood shed and with Robocop we get plenty of both. Robocop is also rife with swipes at capitalism and corporate greed (you can well imagine large corporations wasting huge amounts of money on a failed project and continually refusing to believe that said failed project is a waste of time). This kind of acts as a running theme in the background. I think what really sets Robocop apart from many science fiction/action films is that it has a heart and is also intelligent. In the wrong hands this could have been just a mindless shoot em up (which would have been fine, but it wouldn't have made it particularly memorable). It's also a film that has a lot of heart; Murphy is a likable family man, a nice guy and therefore I found the scenes when he's starting to reform his memories to be particularly moving. These flashbacks and memories help to flesh out Murphy's character and ultimately give us enough of a vested interest to care about his character and the story in general. Are there any problems with this film? Yes only a couple of minor ones though; the ED209 robot effects are clunky and fairly laughable now, but we have to remember that this was made back in 1987 and SFX move on very quickly. I also found it hard to understand why Dick Jones would put a directive 4 in place to stop Robocop arresting him, but didn't put one in to stop Robocop arresting Boddicker or any of his cronies? I mean that is effectively what brought Jones' entire operation down? Having said that these are minor niggles more than anything and despite these minor problems Robocop is still an excellent film. It's violent, it's bloody, but it's also intelligent and strangely for a sci-fi/action film it actually has a bit of heart as well. A wonderful film that has clearly stood the test of time and one that still holds up well following repeat viewings."

Overall, Social Satire Sci-Fi Doesn't Get Any Better than this. Director Verhoeven's Starship Troopers (1997) Comes Close, but This One, Set in a Crumbling American City that Today is a Crumbling American City, is More Up Close and Personal and the Focus is Sharp and Cartoons its Way Into the Annals of Great Pop Culture." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This sci-fi movie still holds up well today. It goes straight to the action. I am amazed that Peter Weller's Robocop can express so much emotion under the mask. In fact, even his walk and movements are very expressive. Miguel Ferrer's role as the ambitious businessman was great. You could feel his desperation. Clarence Boddicker's villainous role is pitch perfect. He plays a crime boss who enjoys wreaking havoc and who killed Peter Weller's character. It is also good that Robocop also highlights some interesting predictions such as an invasion to other countries, and the rise of corporations. In short, this movie succeeds because it is able to balance drama with action without getting too mushy. On the other hand, it knows what it is: an action movie with great shooting." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "In a dystopic and crime-ridden Detroit, a terminally wounded cop returns to the force as a powerful cyborg haunted by submerged memories. Detroit - in the future - is crime-ridden, and run by a massive company. The company have developed a huge crime-fighting robot, which unfortunately develops a rather dangerous glitch. The company sees a way to get back in favor with the public when a cop called Alex Murphy is killed by a street gang. Murphy's body is reconstructed within a steel shell and named RoboCop. The RoboCop is very successful against criminals, and becomes a target of supervillain Boddicker. Roger Ebert wrote \"Most thriller and special-effects movies come right off the assembly line. You can call out every development in advance, and usually be right. \"RoboCop\" is a thriller with a difference.\" RoboCop is not just your run of the mill sci-fi/thriller film or whatever, it is quite a poignant and moving film too." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Professor Weller is spectacular in his portrayal of Murphy. The supporting cast members are all on the same story-page and perform to a 'T'. The movie is directed flawlessly, Paul Verhoeven did a very commendable job with this venture. There is a perfect-paced tempo married with enough suspense laced humor that chuckling and cringing are common place. This thing is enjoyable from beginning to end. For this movie, I had a lot of funthe only flaw I noticed was what happened after this production. Why did they whip up a \"Robocop\" franchise? Why did some knucklehead insist on making sequels? Come on, with sequels gradually sucking worse than their predecessors, the writing should have been on the wall  and I only wish they took the hint and had left well enough alone. Anyways  the movie is awesome and I highly recommend it" "I had not seen it for year, s I don't remember it being as gory back then but I was really surprise as the gory it was, I did not expect that at all. That is one of reason why I really enjoyed the movie, thought it was really well made, a lot of action in the movie that blends in with the drama. There few one-liners to make you laugh, here and there and I think the effects for time was really good. the acting was great from the cast 7 out of 10" "\"Your move, creep.\" Robocop is one of those movies I watched as a kid when I probably shouldn't have, but i'm glad I did. It's consistently as dramatic as it is funny and satirical, making it a really unique film. It has a lot to say about corporations and the government, and what it has to say is relevant even today. Plus it's amazingly 80's feeling, and you gotta love that. The plot of this film comes across as very cheesy. A cop who is killed in action is brought back as a robotic cop. And it is very cheesy. But somehow, the film makes you care about what happens. Perhaps it has to do with Peter Weller's great performance. I feel like it's a pretty underrated performance, because people don't realize how much thought went into the way Robocop moves around. Weller just does it so well. There's also a good amount of practical effects here, such as the blood and gore, and even some stop motion stuff. It's always great to see practical effects rather then the mass amounts of CGI that we see today. Overall, Robocop is a great movie. It's essentially a really well made B-movie, but that's kinda what makes it great. It's highly quotable and lots of fun. Watch it." "The eighties birthed dozens of iconic characters and one of the coolest, in my opinion, has always been RoboCop. Half-man, half-machine. The coolest cop in Old Detroit. More than 20 years later, he's still one of the most awesome action heroes to come out of the era, and the film still holds up today. I lament the fact that there is a new generation whose first exposure to the character might be the toothless 2014 reboot. The original is a far superior film with wit, brutality, and a myriad of memorable moments that stick with you long after the movie's over. From director Paul Verhoeven, ROBOCOP is the story of Alex Murphy (Peter Weller). Murphy is a recent transfer and his first time out in his new precinct ends with local kingpin Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith) and his cronies filling him with more shotgun slugs than one would think humanly possible. Meanwhile, the conglomerate OCP is in need of a \"volunteer\" for their new RoboCop program when their unmanned police robot, the ED-209, displays some hazardous glitches. Murphy is rebuilt as the now legendary RoboCop and immediately begins cleaning the streets of Old Detroit. As the population goes wild for their new law enforcement hero, sinister forces conspire to terminate his program. Boddicker learns that Murphy survived their encounter and wants to tie up his loose ends, and OCP senior president Dick Jones (Ronny Cox) resents that RoboCop overshadowed his own ED-209 program and worries that RoboCop might pose a threat to his underworld ties. Where to begin? I love this movie. The premise, when viewed subjectively, is pretty cheesy: a half-man, half-machine superhuman police officer. But it's just handled so perfectly. It never takes itself too seriously, coming at the audience with a wink and a smile that helps soften the blow of the gratuitous violence. It opens with a news clip where overly-enthusiastic broadcasters deliver news of violence in South Africa with the same dopey smile that they'd deliver celebrity gossip, and the citizens are obsessed with a cheesy, breast-filled sitcom that gave us one of the most quotable lines in the movie (\"I'd buy that for a dollar!\"). Meanwhile, Old Detroit's in shambles with gang violence running rampant. Really, the movie was pretty accurate in it's predictions on what the future of America might look like. We may not be at the dystopian level of the movie yet, but we're close with our TV- obsessed culture and the privatization of the police force a possible reality in the not-too-distant future. ROBOCOP takes what could've been a lazy B-grade action schlock film and turns it into a social commentary. Who would've thought it with a name like ROBOCOP? The movie's got an undercurrent of humor running throughout and has its share of laughs from the sheer absurdity at times. As refreshing as the satire and humor are, it never overshadows the action and ROBOCOP is a shining example of how much Verhoeven loves some brutal violence in his movies. Just as was the case with Brett's death scene in ALIEN, one ROBOCOP scene in particular had haunted me since childhood and was the sole reason it took me a while to revisit the film. I was pretty young at the time and I can't even remember how I came to watch it. I remember the initial boardroom scene with the ED-209 blew my mind but it was until the end of the movie where it got to be a little much when Boddicker's henchman Emil (Paul McCrane) saw his end. That scene cemented itself in my young mind because of just how much it freaked me out. I won't spoil it here for anyone who hasn't seen the movie, but it's probably one of the coolest parts. Despite the horror of the scene sending me running at the time, the image of RoboCop, the character, stuck with me and he was always one of my favorite characters, even though I hadn't the nerve to even finish the movie. Having gone back and revisited the movie in later years, it's no surprise why. RoboCop is just awesome. I love the character design (that new stealth black model of the 2014 is garbage in comparisonlike some sort of an anthropomorphic iPhone) and his stone-cold robotic stoicism. He was like some sort of futuristic Western hero, stomping into town, twirling his gun, and confronting the baddies. As I grew older, I came to realize just how awesome all the performances in the film were (not just the Robo-variety). Kurtwood Smith, who for the longest time I'd only known as the dad from \"That 70's Show\", is a perfect villain! I guess it shouldn't have surprised me but he's bizarrely charismatic for a psychopath. Nancy Allen, Ronny Cox, Miguel Ferrer they're all rock solid in the film. The ROBOCOP franchise might not've seen as much success as I'd want after the mind-blowingly awesome original, but the first film is still a classic piece of action. I was hoping the reboot might pick up where the original left off and build on it but, instead, it's made it apparent that a movie like Verhoeven's ROBOCOP probably wouldn't get made in modern times and I doubt we'll ever see anything that'll stand up to its strength. It has aged amazingly well and it's just as good as it was more than 20 years ago and, if you've gone this long without watching the original 1987 ROBOCOP, you owe it to yourself to give it a shot." "\"Robocop\" is underrated , misunderstood and ingenious classic action science fiction movie. It's full of excess , black humor and satire. There's more here than meets the eye. On the surface it's just a B-class movie , but it exceeds expectations as one of the smartest science fiction movies ever made. The writers were inspired by many sources  \"Wizard of Oz\" , \"Frankenstein\" ,\"Blade runner\" , \"Terminator\" , comic books (Iron man and Judge Dredd) sci-fi stories of William Gibson and even a little bit of western is here. Robocop's three Prime Directives are reminiscent of the Three Laws of Robotics as devised by sci-fi author Isaac Asimov . We have here Brixby Snyder, a parody of Benny Hill whose running line is \"I'd buy that for a dollar\" . There is some subtle Christ imagery here. Verhoeven has stated that he sees the character as a futuristic version of Christ. \"Robocop\" is highly entertaining action movie with heroes for whom you can root and villains who are deliciously evil. Paul Verhoeven's direction is superb. The ultra-violence is so over-the-top that it's not really shocking to look at but almost more comical like because it's just so cartoonish. The action scenes are well staged , fast paced and the mix of live action with stop motion effects works wonderfully. His biggest accomplishment is however the fact that the movie really tugs at viewer's heartstrings. Verhoeven really makes you care about his hero and the movie is full of haunting sadness . The movie has a lot of heart and feels almost like an Greek tragedy. It's not that far from \"Blade runner\" in asking question what it means to be human. The well written screenplay presents a cynical view of future. Money driven society , over-commercialized future , corporate greed , dehumanization of almost everyone  it's all here. The vision of future in \"Robocop\" is really scary , because if you look at the world today you will notice how accurate the movie satire is. Political prostitution , big companies which control almost every part of our existence , criminals everywhere from street thugs to business execs , society dominated by technology  it's all already happening now. \"Robocop\" is a brilliant portrayal of 80's America that is even more relevant today. Wicked , witty , razor sharp script provides a MANY BIG LAUGHS and at the same time is thought provoking. Themes that appear in this movie are : man vs. self , man vs. man , man vs. technology , man vs. society , man vs. fate , identity, humanity , transition , capitalism , technology , privatization. There is uplifting message here that sounds honest  human element will ALWAYS rise in some kind of form. Some brilliant and memorable ideas include series of first-person perspectives , several fake advertisements (The Family Heart Center, Nukem,6000 SUX ) and the climactic \"Melting Man\" scene. There are some awe inspiring design's  Robocop's suit , Robocop's handgun , ED 209. And who could forget such great one liners like \"Dead or alive , your coming with me\" or \"Your move creep\". Acting is a very strong point of this movie. Peter Weller does wonders in the role of Robo. His cold voice , mechanical movements and the whole spectrum of emotions he is able to show only with his jaw.. A truly great performance. Kurtwood Smith shines as the Clarence Bodicker  heartless ,sadistic , Himmler like criminal. The supporting cast is also more than solid  Nancy Allen (Lewis) , Ronny Cox (Dick Jones) , Miguel Ferrer (Bob Morton) and others. Memorable and likable characters that are well played  what more do you need ? Interesting thing  Arnold Schwarzenegger and Rutger Hauer were considered for the role of Robocop. The technical aspects stood the test of time. Movie was rightfully Oscar nominated for best editing and best sound . The half-orchestra , half-synthesizer score by Basil Poleudoris is both heroic and tragic. \"Robocop theme\" is just outstanding. Jost Vocano provides the movie with some great photography. The effects vary from the magnificent to the slightly shoddy , but considering the low budget (only 13 million ) I'm amazed how REALLY well this movie looks. Brilliant , smart and highly entertaining classic from the 80's. I give it 9/10."

"Just watched this again for the first time since the 90's. Simple comic book storyline about a dead cop reclaimed by a big Corporation and converted into a crime fighting cyborg. Extremely violent in places with gory details, the robot effects are entertaining as are the moments of satire throughout the film. There isn't too much more to say about it, Robocop is about cheap thrills for those who enjoy violent movies laced with satire. From what I remember Robocop 2 was decent as well and there is a new Robocop movie but according to Mark Kermode the original is still the best." "A fun concept: In a dystopic and crime-ridden Detroit, a terminally wounded cop returns to the force as a powerful cyborg haunted by submerged memories. It's definitely not the thing to see if you're in the mood for something fun and uplifting, or something with tons of thrills and action. The metaphors in this movie are so abundant. The director likes to show certain things: scenes that might not be a part of the story, but add much to the story in general, the way a writer might prelude a chapter by describing something connected to, but not in line with the characters. Unfairly dismissed by some as confusing. 7/10." "There's quite a bit of fairly funny satire in ROBOCOP, which is one of the things that makes it well worth watching- at least once. The biggest irony, I suppose, is that a lot of what was satirical back in 1987 is nowadays taken for granted as \"just the way things are.\" We've come along way, I guess... Peter Weller gives a solid performance as Murphy and this is arguably Verhoeven's finest film to date, but it was the fx that made this one a must-see when it first hit town. The makeup fx are over-the-top funny (my favorite is the villain who gets soaked with toxic waste and begins melting) and the ED209 was so cool that I kept an action figure of it for years. That's not to downplay the players: everybody in this one is playing it to the hilt, especially Ronnie Cox and Miguel Ferrar; you can hardly wait to see them get THEIRS... It's interesting to go back and look at movies like ROBOCOP decades later and find that some of them still hold up. (I've always wondered if the makers of ROBOCOP were familiar with Jack Kirby's MACHINE MAN: he and Murphy have a great deal in common.)" "This is an action-packed supercop film set in the future in Detroit, a city plagued by crime and whose police department has been bought off by Omni Consumer Products (OCP). After Officer Alex Murphy is killed by a street gang, the company retrieves his body and reconstructs him into a cyborg named RoboCop, who becomes the criminals' greatest adversary. Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner wrote a clever and captivating story for this film and I thought Paul Verhoeven did a good job in the direction, keeping the movie exciting and fast-paced and assembling a dynamic cast of characters. Peter Weller did a great job portraying RoboCop, acting like a superhero as he fights off criminals and inserting drama and emotion into the character that makes the cyborg element more intriguing, especially in the part where RoboCop's human memories of his family and of his demise slowly return to him. His personality and one-liners remind me of Arnold Scharzenegger's Terminator role at times. Nancy Allen gave a warm portrayal of RoboCop's partner-in-crime, Anne Lewis, giving it her all in what is probably her most recognizable roles. Rounding off the cast of characters are the group of ruthless and nasty villains headed by Clarence J. Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith) you would love to root against and headed by Dick Jones, played by Ronny Cox from the Beverley Hills Cop movies. The special effects were pretty good for the most part, although some of the robot scenes were a little too shaky and unrealistic. Some of the acting was also a bit off, reminding you of very 80s cliché dialog. But overall, it's one of the better sci-fi action movies of the 1980s and is throughly entertaining. Grade B" "Probably regarded as Paul Verhoeven's first big directorial debut, Robocop is one of the iconic 1980s film characters, up there with Batman and the Terminator. Even today, the 1987 film still stands up to any scrutiny. Alex Murphy (played by Peter Weller, a man with killer cheekbones) husband and father, is a cop relocated to Detroit's struggling police department in a time of high crime and corporate greed. Clarence Boddicker, a crime boss who works with impunity, and a company CEO look to place military grade robots in cities to replace the degraded police force and take control. However when on assignment, Murphy is maliciously gunned down and killed by Boddicker's men, only for a rival corporation to revive him as an autonomous servant of justice. But is there anything left of Murphy's humanity left? It is easy to forget, twenty-seven years down the line, how bloody and violent Robocop really is, and it doesn't hold back. Murphy's horrific murder occurs in the film's first act and mentally scarred a generation for good reason! But I don't want you to get the wrong impression, I love the film's dedication to using ridiculous amounts of blood squibs and physical stunts. This is what the late 80s were best at, the action in this film is simple but wonderfully executed. The Robocop himself is cumbersome, he walks and moves with deliberately jerky motions, but when the action starts, he is an unstoppable force. I could get side-tracked and go on about the action, ED-209 and all, but what's nice about the film is its more subtle story telling with its characters. Very little is told about Murphy before his death, just enough to get us to understand quite how much has been lost. It is a story of the corporate desire to replace human beings with computers, only here it is literal. Murphy is dead, his body is completely mechanised, his family left, there's nothing for him to hold on to yet his humanity lingers and tries to recover within the bonds of corporate designs. Possibly Paul Verhoeven's best work, it is a simple concept now but it still strikes a cord even in today's world. It has the director's signature satire and humour throughout, and not-so-subtle messages of greed and corporate take overs (got to love those TV adverts, one for a board game called \"Nukem\", were you dictate nuclear war on other nations) If you haven't seen Robocop, what are you doing with your life? Sure some of the composite special effects with the monstrous ED-209 have dated, but it is a solid action movie (and let's not forget in this day and age, an original movie) and it demands your attention." "What can one say about Robocop, the 1987 Verhoeven classic, that hasn't already been said before? A true delight of both visual filmmaking and action driven storytelling. At it's most basic one would describe Robocop as a slick action thriller but under the surface lurks a deeply thought provoking take on Mary Shelly's Victorian classic, Frankenstein and what it is that makes us human? What it is that defines our humanity? No one could ever accuse the story of Robocop of being new, the themes it explores are themes that have been explored and regurgitated in every art form throughout our history, every generation has asked these same questions. The true beauty of Robocop is not in it's originality but in the way Verhoeven makes us look at a familiar tale through new eyes, we the viewer are invited to look at humanity through Robocop's eyes, to see what he sees, to get a glimpse of what it is he thinks and to see what it is specifically that drives his character on in eventually discovering his own humanity. Verhoeven and Neumeier make no allusion to the fact that Robocop is inspired by comic book characters like Judge Dredd and Rom the Space Knight, but unlike the aforementioned Judge Dredd, who's own film in 1995 can only be described as an abortion of filmmaking, Verhoeven and Neumeier are able to successfully and faithfully portray the core concepts of these titular characters on the big screen, whilst retaining a genuine uniqueness and provoking perspective. Even when taking off one's rose tinted glasses, deep fried in greasy cinematic nostalgia, it is obvious that Robocop is a masterpiece of filmmaking that holds up even to this day. Yes some of the effects have aged, most notably the stop-motion animation that brings the ED-209 to life, and some of the dialogue is definitely stuck in the 80's, yet neither of these things can detract from what is otherwise a stellar film. Some have criticized the film for it's over the top action and gore but I find rather than taking your attention away from the central themes of the narrative, the action and gore instead add to it. No action scene in the film is pointless and dragged into the murky waters of style over substance, instead each action scene is central to the film and helps to progress the story forward towards it's blockbuster ending. Modern action filmmakers in the mold of Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich should take note of how it should be done. Perhaps the part of this film that is the most impressive is Peter Weller's performance as the title character, his ability to convey a character who is more machine than man through his movements is at times truly spectacular, such is his ability as an actor, we the audience truly buy him as a robotic law enforcement officer, truly pragmatic in his work, yet at the same time he portrays's a man, a man with weaknesses and doubts, a man capable of love and all the other emotions on the human spectrum. This subtle conveyance of emotion, the tiny facial movements that play across Weller's face, even though we can only see a portion of him is the beauty of Robocop. But perhaps the true genius of Robocop, the holy trinity that makes this film the masterpiece it is, is the titanic culmination of Peter Weller's performance, Verhoeven's direction and Neumeier's writing. Truly these three ingredients are what makes Robocop the classic it is. To summarize Robocop is a surprisingly intelligent action/sci-fi flick that explores and satirizes American culture whilst also making the viewer question what it is to be human? If only they still made films of this caliber, we would truly be living in a true golden age of cinema." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "A brutally injured cop is given the chance to go on in law and enforcement by becoming half man, half machine. After he becomes Robocop he goes after the people who cost him his human life and caused him to be this machine. This film starred: Peter Weller, Nancy Allen & Dan O'Herlihy. Robocop is an enjoyable film, It is funny at some points because of the cringy 80's action films have these cringy scenes all of the time. I do recommend this film because it is a good action film with some funny scenes attached. It is also a good revenge film. ***/***** Good film." "In a dystopian Detroit not too far off from the real thing (1987 or today), the police force is run by a corporation called Omni Consumer Products (OCP). Police officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is savagely attacked by a gang of criminals and left for dead but is revived by OCP and turned into a cyborg super cop. Stylish, satirical, ultra-violent sci-fi action movie with ample doses of black humor. Paul Verhoeven's best film. The kind of movie that is easily dismissed but deserves more praise than it gets. Great action and effects but also solid performances from the cast and a very good script. Basil Pouledoris' score is one of the best of any '80s movie. A classic that gets better with repeated viewings." "Underrated is the truth. The subtle emotional plays between family, the psychological development and metamorphic change of the main character from beginning to the climax, far exceed the original, the changes being brought about by different means. Relevant upgrades using modern technology and well played and the use of set and design make the film an eye candy delight. The flow of the film, the composition to final cut is much smoother than the original. It is a far deeper RoboCop here, a multi layered play that moves effortlessly to the end. If the other movie hadn't existed and this was viewed as a stand alone film, with it's own merits, it would be a good film. The comparisons to the original film should be put aside, it is not a scene by scene remake like Psycho, Nikita, The Vanishing or other films ruined by a dull or sanitized ending. It is a great as a sci-fi future film in the tones of the Terminator, fresh and updated.... for now." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "As the technical prowess and political power of corporations have grown, so have the people's fear and suspicion of corporate governance. Robocop brings these issues to the fore. In an unknown time of anarchic crime, a large corporation intends to privatize the police force by installing bionic police officers throughout the city. Robocop, a resurrected police officer, is the first of this kind. He is a machine and yet retains some of his humanity. As the movie progresses, he gradually rediscovers this humanity until he overthrows his corporate makers, who, of course, are not interested in people's safety as much as profits. The movie is hopeful: Corporations can never eradicate human morality and free will. What makes Robocop great is its streamlined and to-the-point editing. The movie wastes nary a second. Every scene briefly illustrates a plot point or an action scene, and then moves on. The movie even ends at its climax, having no time for post-climatic sentiment and catharsis. Despite being thirty years old, the movie still feels fresh and futuristic, perhaps because it doesn't rely on special effects so much as hard metal and fiery explosions. Robocop is a classic. It brings up interesting issues that TV shows are still exploring (e.g., Continuum), all while being very entertaining."

"*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Well I wanted to see this movie for a couple of reasons - one being that I liked the idea of it and the other being that I enjoy the work of Paul Veerhoven as a director (for the most part). Many people seem to build this up as a sci-fi/action classic and I agree. Okay so the story - a rookie cop named Alex Murphy is in a Dystopian Detroit where crime is everywhere. On his first assignment he is blown apart by a Crime gang. Meanwhile a company named OCP is working on ways to make the city safer. One way is with a complete robot that malfunctions in the sense that even if the criminal complies he gets more holes in him than Swiss cheese while another project is to take the corpse of an existing cop and replace most of his body with mechanical parts. After Murphy awakes as RoboCop and he becomes a big success. The person who designed him gets assassinated by the guy who built the malfunctioning robot, named Richard Jones on the grounds of \"You went over my head! I wanted to do something like this!\". Then RoboCop finds out that he was once human and that the people who killed him still roam free and he tries to arrest or kill everyone responsible. Once that finally happens he realizes the Crime Boss works for Jones. Okay I just have to mention this before I talk about anything else. Why is it in Action movies the henchmen can't hit the hero if he was 2 feet in front of him. Now, they seem to hit RoboCop with a pistol okay but there is a scenario in this movie where four guys armed with high tech bazooka's couldn't hit A SEVEN FOOT TALL SLOW MOVING HALF ROBOT! I think that's a pretty easy target to spot and easier to shoot it. To be fair though that scene is hilarious. Now onto the stuff I liked. The emotion of the story. It might be a little bit cliff note but most of the science fiction movies of today rarely put in any emotion (there have been a few small exceptions like Serenity and Neill Blomkamp's work but that's all off the top of my head). It might be small but I liked it very much. And of course there's just so many times this movie goes over-the-top. Every death scene of a major villain is usually done in the most over the top way they can think of among other things like the commercials. The entertainment value in something like that for me just makes me like the movie a bit more for the charm of doing this. RoboCop is just simply 80's cheese. The special effects for it's time are actually pretty damn impressive, to an extent they still are to this day. The Sets are really good and there's just so much enjoyment to be had from just watching some over-the-top gory action but with surprisingly a but of heart. I will watch the sequels and the remake (although to be fair it looks more like a \"I'm just going to wait until DVD for this one\"). If you like Science fiction with an action edge then this is for you." "A true master piece of the action genre. Robocop's struggle between being man or machine really is interesting. The graphic nature of this movie feels like the 80's action movie it is. True those that are skeptical of blood probably won't enjoy some of the scenes, overall the story of a company putting man inside a machine for justice is worth seeing a few people shot. I also love Peter Welling's portraying of his character. From the loving husband to the robot to having to find himself, you can't help but root for him through the entire movie. He is like a superhero in a sense and watching the whole movie is sure to give you goosebumps. This is one movie no action movie fan should miss." "Now that the remake is inevitable this movie is simply one of the best sci-fi action of all time. When this movie came out in 1987 was extremely violent (now 26 years later still is very violent) the special effects was Awesome,the action amazing,the acting more than good and the music unforgettable. The movie was directed by Paul Verhoven and this movie was the star for another great sci fi movies he later make (Total Recall,Starship Troopers)so the movie was in the right hands since the beginning. The movie worth it to see again i personally recommended to see it in blu ray...Go besides Robocop and make justice!!!." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This is a very good movie and I am becoming to think that Verhoeven is a very intelligent director. The movie is a action movie but there are a few things that stand out and that is the character of Robocop - rather than simply being an emotionless killing machine, like the Terminator, it is a being struggling with its humanity and duty to serve. It also shows intelligence as it looks not only at its prime directives, but at a forth hidden directive. The story is based around a lot of things. It is set in the future where the signs of industrialisation are showing on the world and America is quickly disintegrating (gee, might even be now). What one must remember is that this is the first of a trilogy and more is unfolded in further movies. The giant in this world is Omni Consumer Products (OCP) and they are based in Detroit and have plans to create a new city. Unfortunately crime is running rampant in the city, led by the crime lord Clarance Bardiager, and the cops are fighting a loosing battle. OCP attempts to implement a new droid, ED-209, but is does not work, killing an executive in a board meeting. Vice President Dick Jones is pushing for the ED-209 unit, but a younger executive has an idea, Robo-cop. Alex Murphy, a recent transfer, is then seriously injured in a nasty altercation with Clarence Bardeger and his gang, and is rushed to hospital where he dies on the hospital table. His body is appropriated by OCP and he is turned into Robocop, the ultimate law enforcer. They believe that he is just a machine controlled by a human brain, but we slowly notice that he still has his personality and his memories. The first example of this is that when he is asked to list his directives, he gives the main three, and then searches and discovers a forth hidden one. This movie is a character study of Robocop set in the background I have described. It is a background of corporate struggles, escalating crime, and blackmail. As Robocop is becoming embroiled in the corporate struggles and lies, he is trying to rediscover his identity and convince himself that he is alive. We learn more about the Robocop units in the next movie, but in this one we simply see a man dedicated to enforcing the law. One person recognises him, and that is his former partner. Even though she only worked with Murphy for one day, she instantly recognised one of his mannerisms and realised that this Robocop was made from the remains of Murphy. As the movie progresses, Robocop slowly comes explore his memories and seeks to bring himself back to life. Everywhere he looks he sees the remnants of a dead Murphy: all except for his former partner, who recognises that Murphy has been resurrected in the form of a very strong Robocop (we know that he is not indestructible). The epiphany is when he gets his partner to adjust his targeting and his shoots the canisters of babyfood that he was being fed. He is not a baby, he is Alex Murphy. And for the rest of the movie he has his helmet removed. Also in this movie, the Old Man, the managing director of OCP, seems to be the good guy. The bad guy is VP Dick Johnson, who is consorting with criminals and manipulating things to give him more money and power. He wants the ED-209 to succeed because he knows that a faulty robot brings much more money to OCP than does a perfect Robocop. Unfortunately for Dick, Murphy blows away an ED-209 within two seconds (though his first encounter is not to crash hot, but then he was caught by surprise). I just love this movie, as one can see that I have been raving on about it for such a long time. There is a lot in this movie, but on top of that it is also very entertaining. I simply love Robocop." "RoboCop is considered one of the best action sci-fi films of the 1980s, a dark, satirical film from the Dutch master of sci-fi action Paul Verhoeven. In the future Detroit is a crime infested city with gangs running wild and the police struggling to cope, made even worst when a private company, Omni Consumer Products (OCP) buy the Detroit police force. OCP are looking for ways to make the police more effective by using robotic police enforcers and a middle level executive, Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer) proposes the RoboCop project. On the front line Alex Murphy (Paul Weller) is a police officer transferred to central Detroit, the most dangerous precinct in the area. When he gets fatally and brutally shot on his first day of duty he becomes a prime candidate to become RoboCop, the ultimate law enforcer. But as RoboCop Alex starts to regain his memories and sets out to find his wife and son and find the men who destroyed his life. RoboCop is a gloriously violent film that Verhoeven is expert at providing this over the top style with limbs getting blown off and massive bullet holes blown into people. There are solid action sequences throughout, particularly the shoot outs and car chases. Verhoeven knows how to make it the action compelling, even though on the surface RoboCop seems invincible and character seeming physically slow. For the time RoboCop had excellent special effects, using physical effects like the costume and the charm of seeing stop motion effects. One of the key elements to why people love RoboCop is the comedy, dark humour and satire. This is mainly shown at the looks of the corporate world with a multi-national company particularly privatising all public services, including services that should not be run for profit. There are digs at the corporate culture of the 80s of backstabbing, drug taking and basically only caring about profit when older businessmen do at least care about their products and consumers. This is certainly a criticism of Reganism and Thatcherism and the idea of business being a left to their own devices. There are also broader satires in the form of adverts and news reports, tackling American militarism, consumerism and attacked the idea of a Star Wars laser system. There are even modern comparisons (as of 2013) you can put to the film because many American cities, including Detroit, have declared bankruptcy or on the edge of bankruptcy. There are many cities in Mid- West of America suffering from industrial and urban decline, population decline, underfunded public services and social issues like poverty and crime, leading to a vicious circle. RoboCop can act as a commentary on these themes. One of the other key parts to the film is RoboCop finding his humanity and discovering his past, giving the film more heart and making you care more for Murphy as his life is robbed from him and more then just a bad ass crime fighter. Weller actually had a different role of someone regain his emotions and life, made tougher due to the character having a helmet covering most of his face. Weller puts it off and he had an excellent supporting cast, from Nancy Allen as a tough as nails cop who realises who RoboCop really is, Ronny Cox and Kurtwood Smith as the villains and Ferrer as a typical young highflyer in 80s culture. RoboCop is a product and commentary of its time but it is still an entertaining action film with substance, something Verhoeven does really well and it is a shame that R-rated sci-fi and action film are made as much as they use to." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong. That's Murphy's Law indeed. That's what happen to Alex Murphy (Peter Weller). Directed by Paul Verhoeven, written by Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner and set in a crime-ridden Detroit, Michigan in the near future, police officer Alex Murphy is brutally murdered by a gang of cop-killers lead by Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith). Yes, Red from that's 70's Show. Man, is he gets brutal in this movie. The movie's death scene of Murphy was the most important scene in the whole film by the director Verhoeven not because it was mere blood and guts but because it was an extremely disturbing scene where a person is tortured to death and dies in agony. It was the fullest expression of the violence of American society as viewed by Verhoeven. The movie is filled with very critical outlooks on a hyperbole negative stereotype of 80s American society, some seem very true to this day. The violence in this film is so over the top, it's silly in a way. Anyways, in some odd outlandish unrealistic way, he survived the attack. I don't know if I saw a man get 50 bullet holes in him. I would think he would be clearly dead, but he did somehow pull through. Like the 1974's Six-Million Dollar Man, Murphy is subsequently revived by the malevolent mega-corporation Omni Consumer Products (OCP) as a superhuman cyborg law enforcer known as RoboCop. Robocop nailed the cyborg concept with a cumbersome first generation unit meshed with a human being who slowly starts to piece together and remember his past human life. Over time the flashbacks that occurred gave him the memories to the point, that he seek vengeance on the gang that killed his former self. This movie is very stylish with its gore, and sort of 'yuppie' 80s businessmen cocaine type villain. The way, Paul Verhoeven shot the film with crazy 'comic' like angles gives the film, it's creative original. The movie drew it's success from the portrayal of this stoic, priority driven machine that was also something more. I liked Murphy wasn't explicitly human when he became Robo Cop, he was just a robot with the face of a man--but every now and then, that robot; something so incapable of humanity, would do something subtle and perfect, like smile or twirl his gun, and it created this illusion of a man trapped inside the machine. Murphy's slow, subtle regaining of his humanity, and his own innate sense of order and justice made the film. This movie also works as dark satire comedy with the over the top reporting and fake commercials that is throughout the film like the 'nukem' board game. In my opinion, the movie could had done without those things, because it makes away from the main plot of Robo Cop seeking revenge. There was a bit of controversial coming from this movie. The movie was originally given an X rating by the MPAA in 1987 due to its graphic violence, in sharp contrast to most other X-rated movies that received the rating due to strong sexual content. RoboCop was X-Rated 11 times before getting a R Rated. To appease the requirements of the ratings board, Verhoeven reduced blood and gore in the most violent scenes in the movie, including the executive shot to death by ED-209, Murphy's execution, and the final battle with Boddicker. A lot of kid toys were created when this movie came out, and the movie isn't a kid movie at all! It's ultimate violence, has nudity, gore and harsh language. While the marketing for the toys is market for children, the movie is a rare Sci-Fiction made for adult. It's make it even more rare today, where most Sci-Fiction movies today are PG-13.Robocop has lot of great themes like about the will of the human spirit overcoming greed and corruption. This is eugenics defined. Man and machine merging together creating a police state of the classes and no will towards freedom of expression. RoboCop themes cover a lot of issues, the media, gentrification, corruption, privatization, capitalism, identity, dystopia and human nature. Director Paul Verhoeven, known for his heavy use of Christian symbolism, states in the documentary \"Flesh and Steel: The Making of RoboCop\" that his intention was to portray RoboCop as a Christ figure. I just didn't see this. I really don't see RoboCop in the same light of Jesus. Unless, Jesus shot a bunch of drug- dealers during his time on Earth. The character of RoboCop itself was inspired by British comic book hero Judge Dredd. You can see the similarities clearly with the robot design suit. Taking influence from Japanese comics \"The 8 Man\" and the first Tokusatsu Metal Hero \"Uchuu Keiji Gavan (Space Sheriff Gavan)\" from Toei. Based on Peter Weller, the suit was hard to move in. You can clearly see that in the film. There are moments that I think Robo Cop might trip or fall over when he walk. It isn't that bad. By making him so stiff, it's allows us to believe that he is indeed a Robot. The stop motion is a bit dated and laggy, but it was pretty cool at the time. I did like ED-209. The sound was a bit trippy. There was apparently no sound re-editing in the film, because the scenes feel very rough in terms of audio, and you can even hear where certain sounds are looped in order to fill the newfound soundtrack gaps in the extended scenes. The score is amazing, Basil Poledouris did a good job. I'm not looking forward to RoboCop reboot in 2014. Here all I see is a man inside of a black Iron Man style suit who is swift moving and acts with too much human emotion to portray a realistic cyborg. It's so unlike this movie. In the end, RoboCop is a deep well made satire with amazing effects and top-notch emotional drama" "Extremely violent but entertaining and smart film(directed with high energy and style by Paul Verhoeven) about a viciously murdered policeman being \"resurrected\" in a scientific experiment involving placing his mind, and some body parts, into a mobile machine(called Robocop) where he will be sent out to fight crime in a brutal and corrupt Detroit in the near future. Peter Weller and Nancy Allen are very good here, playing former partners trying to adjust to the situation, all the while fighting not only vicious drug gangs, but the very company that built the Robocop technology. The supporting cast is very good, the writing sharp,(much effective satire here) and the model F/X astonishing. Only issue is that it doesn't know when enough is enough at times,(climax gets pretty wild) but otherwise a pretty good film, first of a trilogy." "Robocop is a great with a good storyline that sometimes falls flat but is overall strong and different,the cast aren't brilliant,but all the highly exaggerated action and effects won't make their performances a huge problem.Peter Weller does do a good job,but thats only once he becomes Robocop,who is suppose to be motionless.The movie had some surprising heart,very likable characters and the effects were very impressive for a movie made in 1987.It probably won't turn out very good,but I look forward to seeing the remake next year,it will be interesting to see how it could look today,which much better effects available.Robocop certainly isn't perfect and you should definitely toss your brain out the window before you watch it,but its a must see for all action fans. Alex Murphy (Peter Weller),a police officer,is murdered by a gang of criminals,but borough back to life as a cyborg,known as Robocop,who fights crime and never sleeps,now looking to track down the criminals who killed him." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "The story of a young American policeman who after being brutally murdered is then brought back to life as a robot losing everything but his face and the memories of his loved ones. Although tragic in a way, Robocop or Murphy as he preferes to be known adjusts well to his new life as a kind of metal man, he benefits greatly from his new bulletproof body especially in fire fights with baddies. It's also worth noting how much free time Robocop now has due to being relieved of the need to sleep or urinate, and credit to him he uses his time well to hunt down the very people who murdered his human self and left him the pathetic shell he's now became. But it's not all doom and gloom as Robocop flirts with and eventually woos a young lady called 'Lois' and the two go on to enjoy a whirlwind romance, Robocop thrilled at one last chance at love whilst Lois at first impressed with her new fiances firm handshake eventually loses interest at his inability to procreate. Heart broken but also still very much a robot Robocop removes his helmet and goes on a rampage leading to the death of Dick Jones a brilliant entrepreneur and all round good egg." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Despite all the setbacks in production of this film. Note that RoboCop is a film. Not a movie. The wonderful narrative of RoboCop is that despite being an armored-clad cop, Murphy is portrayed as vulnerable. That is unfortunate in movies today. Too often, many a protagonist faces off with a half-assed antagonist and barely breaks a sweat en route. What RoboCop is up against is simply politics. Awesomely portrayed as a neo-Roman Empire with unlimited and ruthless conglomerate. This is not too far-fetched as one would think with the \"Great Recession\" in vogue. The conflict is that RoboCop is built by an ambitious exec who has a rivalry with the VP of the same conglomerate. While this may seem like a permeation of Mad Men, it's manifested in the plausible future where the municipalities of Detroit are literally bankrupt. The VP brokers a deal with Boddicker the prominent crime czar who parallels dick Jones VP in the conglomerate, only difference is that Boddicker is not employed by any official entity. Boddicker is a VILLAIN. He has no delusions or justification of what he does. He does it gleefully and makes no apologies afterward. Producers take note of this antagonist. I get so tired of all these civilized Blofeld types who \"kill you with kindness\". Boddicker is a villain you enjoy hating. That provokes emotions which...well, the film has done it's job! There is violence, but for today's standards, is pretty tame. It's not the gory kind, rather the kind that shows violence without implying. Just straight to the carnage. The film is really grounded in the way it portrays the future. No flying vehicles, time travel, or teleportation here. Just a raw gritty dystopia in the context of a political thriller dabbled with a satirical throwback to the yester-years of Reagan-ism. Truly, a sci-fi entry in the annals of the genre. I'll just say this much: RoboCop is not a \"movie\", it is a film in the boneyard of ghastly crap. Audaciously calling itself \"sci-fi\". Total Rekall, Blade Runner, Aliens, and 2001 are all films. Not \"movies\"."

"*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "\"RoboCop\" is as good as it gets when it comes to action films. It achieves that particular distinction of being both smart and fun at the same time. While on the one hand it satisfies as extremely visceral entertainment, it takes such a satirical look at the world of the future - commercials, newscasts, and all - that it delivers many good and substantial chuckles. It's done in a classic comic book tradition, with heroes for whom you can root and villains who are deliciously evil. It takes place in the Detroit of the near future, when the police force is now being funded and controlled by a private, omnipotent corporation named OCP. Its vision of the future is pretty bleak, with the cops being overwhelmed by various degenerate lunatic criminals. Fortunately, an executive named Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer) has an innovative idea: take a police officer \"killed\" in the line of duty and transform them into a sleek, sophisticated cyborg. The cop who gets this honour is Murphy (Peter Weller), who isn't as \"perfect\" as his creators would like: he still retains some human memories and becomes obsessed with punishing the bad guys who put him in his current predicament. Superior urban hell production design, wonderfully rousing music by Basil Poledouris, and lots of hit-you-across-the-face bloody violence help to make this a solid diversion all the way from start to finish. It's just a hell of a lot of fun. The special effects are (for the most part) amazing; Rob Bottin, who'd wowed us with his work on \"The Howling\" and \"The Thing\", is the man behind the look of RoboCop, and Phil Tippett supervises the stunning ED-209 sequences. The excellent cast also includes Nancy Allen, Daniel O'Herlihy, Robert DoQui, Ray Wise, Felton Perry, and Paul McCrane, but making the biggest impressions are Ronny Cox and Kurtwood Smith as two of the most vile bad guys to ever be committed to celluloid. Weller does a fine job of working within his cumbersome costume and creates some very human moments amid all of the nastiness on display. Allen, in a change of pace type of role, is appealing as the partner who maintains her connection to her partner, no matter what. Ferrer is good sleazy fun as the ambitious young creep. \"RoboCop\" is overall so sharp, funny, and exciting that it holds up quite well on repeat viewings. It's no surprise that it would spawn a franchise consisting of two sequels, a live action TV series, an animated series, and an upcoming remake. 26 years later, it's still one of the best action films of the past few decades. 10 out of 10." "Robocop The key to creating an ideal cyber-cop is ensuring that when salvaging tissue from the donor not to transfer over the donut-craving gene. Fortunately, the scientists in this sci-fi movie only relocated the deceased's face and memories. After being killed by a crime syndicate kingpin (Kurtwood Smith), the bullet-riddled body of Officer Murphy (Peter Weller) becomes the basis of Omni Consumer Products - the police force's parent company - first foray into mechanized officers. Tasked with cleaning up the gang-controlled streets while his human counterparts go on strike, Robocop is diligent. But when his old partner recognizes him, the floodgates holding back his memories of being Murphy are opened. A gory parody concerning the privatization of the public sector, Robocop is a smart Frankenstein-esque story that stimulates the brains low and highbrow hemispheres. While they are still cops, thankfully, the robotic ones only sexually harass the police precinct's vending machines. (Green Light) vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca" "The story essentially begins when policeman Alex Murphy is shot to death by the movie's villains in a proverbial industrial hideout. But luckily it's a quick death. Oh wait, no... no it's not. It's not a slow death at all. In fact, it is worth noting for those who proceed unawares that Murphy is not Robocop before he get's shot. You could be forgiven for thinking that he is, because he skillfully stays on his feet while being shot multiple times with multiple shot guns. Murphy is given the Darth Vader treatment and quickly resurrected as a lean mean metal machine out to get the villains who sorta killed him. The villains are a gang of thugs who aren't so much ferocious fiends as they are fanatical fun boys. One cackles like a hyena, one is a club- goer, one is a ginger jerkoff, and one can't fly. But they all enjoy turning an all-American cop into Swiss cheese. They are lead by a bald bespectacled guy named Clarence. Clarence has one problem. Cops don't like him, so Clarence don't like cops. Cops of the robo variety don't like him much either. Then there's Ron Miller! Ron Miller doesn't like to be jerked off. When people jerk him off, they die. Who is Ron Miller? He's the hostage taker who doesn't like to be jerked off. What do you get when you watch Robocop? Corporate politics, smart sexy girls, \"I'd buy that for a dollar,\" and a murdering robot named Ed who squeals like a pig when he falls over, Dead or alive you're coming with Robocop. However, if you're a rapist or a burgler, you will not be apprehended." "I'm a person from the 80's decade, this film was part of my childhood I saw this when I was about 8 if you can believe that, it's my favorite movie from one of my favorite movie directors Paul Verhoeven but most importantly this is one of my favorite movies of all time. There is just so much to this film which is one of the reasons I love it. On the surface it seems like a typical superhero story, but underneath there are layers that elevate this film to be something even more. The production value, special effects and makeup work by my favorite makeup artist Rob Bottin are all great and they still look great today because their all practical. There was a huge budget backing this film and they used every cent wisely because a truck load of effort and heart was behind it. Music is great from one of my favorite movie composers the late great Basil Polebouris, that Robo theme is one of my favorite theme songs ever. The action is great it is well choreographed and extremely violent with the gore effects involved, one of my favorite shoot out scenes is the infamous drug warehouse battle it was awesome not just on how many baddies Robo can kill but just seeing Robo use tai chi like movements with his gun against them. The villains are great from Dick Jones played well by Ronny Cox whom is a ruthless CEO that is interested in both making money and becoming the head of OCP not caring how many lives he destroys. However the one villain that really stands out for me is Clarance Bodyger play well by Kurtwood Smith. He is a right hand man for Jones whom also wants to make the big bucks, however he's also a borderline psychopath that just loves to kill cops and innocent people for fun. I also like how he has sort of this dark charisma and sometimes seems to exhibit some sort of anger management issues. And of course the other villain is the ED-209 robot, which is a great design that has been homaged in many other works. But I find the robot both menacing but funny because despite it's capabilities and how big it is, it never works correctly. Let alone like a video game boss is easy to beat once you know it's weaknesses. We see a parallel with Clarance and his criminal organization and OCP, both are businesses and their goal is simply to make money. Like in one scene we hear what Clarance's organization was going to do with the stolen money from the armored truck which was to us it as capital investment just to make more money. Dick Jones in a scene mentions when Delta City is being built illegal gambling, drugs, and prostitution will be on the rise and that would mean more money for both Dick and Clarance. The OCP company alone is interesting, it seems like a company that does great things and could of done even more but the problem is it's their greed, selfishness, and even slightly unrealistic ambitions are what keep them from making a difference. The film deviantly acknowledged the Regan era when capitalism and technology were both on the rise. The future portrayed in this film is very much prolific to what is happening today. This film has mean spirited fun with it's use of humor/black humor and satire that hits close to home, as it tackles the issues of privatization of services, monopolization, consumerism, and our common addiction to technological progress. To me the funnest moment was in those commercials we saw like that board game \"Nuke Em\" I'm still wondering what the rules of that game are. But also the film dealt with a philosophical concepts of identity, humanity and transition. Alex Murphy/Robocop is played flawless by one of my favorite actors Peter Weller, this is my favorite role from him. He hit the right notes in both emotion and physicality. I really loved how he moved which were sort of miming and tai chi like movements, he was believable as a robot moving at a strange yet natural sort of speed where he was swift but slow at the same time. The capabilities and abilities of Robo are great from his trademark gun twirl I always love, I do that every time I play a light gun video game. Though to me the most impressive was the data probe which gives you the ability to download and upload info on the computer from your brain, almost reminiscent of the sci-fi stories of William Gibson which always had to do with technology and humans trying to integrate together. But most of all I really love the amount of emotion he was able to display making Alex/Robo and superhero you feel a heavy sense of pathos for. Alex/Robo is having an identity crisis as memories of his former life download and he is just struggling to make sense as to who he is. Is he a man that was turned into a machine and is just remembering he was once a man; or is he a machine dreaming he was once a man and desires to be one. One scene I always found heartbreaking was when Alex/Robocop visits his home only to find it empty and the memories of his past flood in, that scene always made me tear up because it really showed two things a life that Alex/Robo can never go back to and also how being a superhero is never without a price to pay. This all the more makes us want Alex/Robo to win not just to overcome the forces of evil but to reclaim or find his humanity. Robocop has all the right part that continue to make him work. Rating: 4 stars" "I fondly remember seeing RoboCop as a mid-teen (sorry Dad) and being impressed by it's loud explosions, gun battles, highway chases and overall attitude. I view it now as a dressed to impress satire of quick- fire American news and commercials, almost as if Dutch maestro Paul Verhoeven decided to serve the U.S a massive overdose of it's own excess. Seeing the film after many years, it's this satirical element that really stands out. The action is noisy and brash, the bad guys are overblown to the point of verging on comical, and the violence, particularly the scene in which Peter Weller is blasted to bits before his Robo transformation, still shocks. Technically, as you might expect for an 'R' rated science fiction film coming out in the late 80′s, the special effects are something of a mixed bag of bolts. At times the FX look worse than bad Ray Harryhausen, especially when a clunky looking ED209 wobbles into the scene, but the now iconic Robo suit really holds up. Amid the violence and noise, there's a sad story here too as Murphy's consciousness, now trapped inside the RoboCop suit, battles with his programming to ascertain his own identity. Flashbacks taunt him and like Frankenstein's monster, there is a strong sense of pity felt throughout. While sometimes the silliness prevents it from attaining the classic status of say 'The Terminator', RoboCop proves to still be a curious mix of satire, overblown 80′s action and good old fashioned sci- fi." "The 80's was the epidemic of landmark movies. It was no doubt an era of heavy artillery supplied by Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger. To name a few; Predator 87\", First Blood 82\", Aliens 86\", The Terminator 84\" and more would all go forward to rule the 1980's. Released in 1987, Robocop would have to bring something explosive to the table. This futuristic sci-fi takes place in Detroit were crime rate is at its highest. The streets are crawling with Junkies, prostitutes while a global tech business, OCP (Omni Consumer products), over looks the city and controls the reign of law. It does not get more gritty than the portrayal we see at first hand. OCP is known for its advanced technology and continuity in daily developments created and mastered to protecting the public from the scum. With not much belief in your average police department, it is when the giant company buys out the police task force in hopes to creating something stronger and less vulnerable as murderers and rapists pile the dark streets of Detroit. It is when rogue cop Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is blasted to death during a tense infiltration into one of Detroit's cold blooded gangs, (a gruesome scene that joined movie history) that sees Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer) of OCP perform a body transformation. With adjustments to save the general organs of Murphy's remains, the staff at OCP construct a steel shell around the dead body of Murphy resulting in a \"\"Robocop\",a programmed walking talking killing machine assigned to protect the innocent with the ability to sustain and arrest. While Murphy's soul is nothing short of deceased, it is when former partner and witness to the crime Lewis (Nancy Allen) discovers the man behind the metal plates resulting in Robocop's reflection of memories, which is something OCP didn't want. The action packed plot sees Bob's Robocop create a kill list behind the death of his former self. The main target is indeed, in my opinion one of the biggest dirt bags to ever hit our screens, Clarence (Kurtwood Smith). If Satan had an apprentice, it was this guy. It delights me to witness the path of revenge that Robocop follows, leading to an all out war as Clarence and his men try ridding the streets of the only thing standing in their way. Although OCP staff and second man on the managers board Dick (Ronny Cox) represents true justice, Dick has eyes on a different future for the advanced company, a future without Robocop, which leads Robocop on an investigation that connects dots between the criminals of Detroit and the rich that overlook it. Ah yes, the nostalgic reflection of this movie still excites me. One year before my birth, Robocop was swarming cinemas global, estimating a total of 13,000,000 in budget. Just like a plethora of 80's action, Robocop was, and still is one of the best of that era. Its concept was highly original then, and unfortunately could not have competed with The Terminator and T2, it did succeed in terms of Sci-fi action and joined a host of movies that showed the possible gruesomeness of real-life shootings. Scene of Death: Upon the origin of Robocop, Murphy had to make a sacrifice. Not knowing he would become a protective cyborg of Detroit, he foolishly rushed in, disturbing a group of animals, resulting in a terrifying scene. Do you remember? He had his leg, arm, and eventual head blasted with shotguns, machine guns the lot. Clarence and his affiliates were a new breed of murders and rapists, which lead to a whole new direction in my movie history. The gore was frightening and the screams of laughter toward a dead cop is more haunting. The acting is far from convincing. The overall cast consisted of some well known faces of that era, if not genre of movies. In my opinion, it was just as well Peter Weller had to play out the movie in a metal suit and robotic concept as I don't think I could have stuck his cheesy acting through-out the 150minutes or so. Although he is the hero an lead star, he is the worst actor associated with this classic... sorry. Apart from a handful of low budget movies, Weller has done the voice for Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1 & Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 2...random? Ronnie Cox, as we know from Eddie Murphy's Beverly Hills Cop, was then and maybe still an accomplished actor playing numerous roles of good and bad. Kurtwood Smith made appearances in Deep Impact, Rambo 3, Broken Arrow and many more. Apart from its cheesy one liners, Robocop is and always will be one of my Childhood favorites. I know, it was strictly 18's (strictly), there was just no way I wasn't watching this movie. Unfortunately I can't say the same for what was to follow. I am sure the majority of fans will agree if I say that RoboCop 2 was mediocre, although it will never, NEVER be as bad as RoboCop 3!!! It is hardly worth referencing, but I believe the situation was played out with Peter Weller witnessing a script that read Robotic Ninjas and immediately decided to shove the pen he was given up the writers ass! For those who don't know, a re-make is set for release in 2013, with a cast Gary Oldman, Joel Kinnaman and Samuel L. Jackson. At this stage I struggle to see how anything can go wrong when the legendary Gary Oldman is involved. Joel Kinnaman is the star of the murderous TV series, The Killing. As for Samuel Jackson?... Overall: 80's Sci-fi action, 80's bloodshed, 80's acting = a dam good time! Did you enjoy my review? check out my previous and up to date reviews at my blog - http://gerrysreviewsforthosecurious.blogspot.com/" "At the time this movie came out, RoboCop addressed a lot of issues that were occurring at the time. The plot was actually your regular cop drama but with science fiction twist inserted right in the middle. Writers Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner have made a film that not only makes us wish RoboCop was a real figure but also reveals the power struggle between the good-willed and corrupt individuals in and out of normal society. Then there's also director Paul Verhoeven who tops the whole project with his signature of blood, guts and more blood. As the well-known story goes, RoboCop was once a humble human being. His name was Alex Murphy, both portrayed by actor Peter Weller. And he does not become RoboCop until he is brutally murdered while trying to arrest a few gang thugs. Once Murphy is reborn as the ultimate killing machine, he then sets out to do what he was programmed to do. Weller gives a stellar performance as the cyborg that he is. The movement of RoboCop is very much applaudable. It gives the illusion that he's scanning, analyzing, and calculating his options for each situation that he's in. Don't you wish you could do that? Playing the thugs' leader is Clarence Boddicker, acted by Kurtwood Smith. Smith is so convincing with his character, that it almost seemed like he was having fun being Boddicker all the time! It's ironic because who would want to know him? Boddicker has no soft spots anywhere, for anyone. And there's a difference because he's not a psychotic killer; he's heartless. He's a five year old child who has a \"blow up things\" mindset in a forty year old man's body. He doesn't care what collateral damage he makes either as long as it satisfies him. Even weirder is the fact that some may find Smith's character more appealing that Weller's! Interestingly enough, RoboCop is able regain a bit of his humanity when he ends up running into one of Boddicker's pals. It's from there he starts to become conscious of who he was, what he had, and what he is now. And although RoboCop is not a big talker at first, he does have his moments of comedy and sadness, which will make the audience like his character a little more every time he's on screen. It was thoughtful of the writers to give RoboCop a part of his old life back, because otherwise there wouldn't be much for the audience to be happy about. Yes so he's now much more powerful than he was as a human, but what's it like now to be him? Thankfully, that question is answered and it's almost tear jerking at times. Note that I've only gone over the main characters. Now there's the topic of costume design and make-up effects. These two groups really had something going here. The idea of what RoboCop should look like is enthralling. What baffles me to this day is how they got it to look like the face of Peter Weller was stapled onto the front of a robotic head. These people literally had to know what they were getting themselves into when they signed onto this project. How to get a human being to look like that requires a lot of creativity. The action is good too. And by action, I define it as the amount of carnage. Whenever Paul Verhoeven makes a film, blood is a requirement and this film delivers it by the pint. It's not a gore festival but it is on the bloodbath scale. The music, composed and conducted by Basil Poledouris is a valuable element to the film as well. The movie has its own theme and it has light brushes sci-fi tunes in it too. It's a film that is hard not to enjoy. Noted as one the best science fiction films ever made, this film was a star-making role for Peter Weller. The violent scenes fit the tone perfectly as do the dramatic moments between them." "The black comedy is funny, although sometimes you feel bad laughing at so much violence, but the sideswipes are the best. Verhoeven takes digs at TV with his advert filled news broadcasts, at privatisation by showing the crumbling police stations and the huge corporate towers and at heroism by showing Robocop creating just as much mayhem and destruction as the criminals he pursues. His strength however is the action scenes and the sense of tension he creates - I'll don't think anyone can forget the sheer terror of ED209's 'glitch'. Weller is good - cast because of his strong jaw and ability to project emotion through a suit of armour - and he does manage to bring out the human side. Allen is good but a but dry. The real support comes from the eccentric, and well known villains and corporate bosses. Ronny Cox, Smith, Ray Wise, Perry, O'Herlihy and Miguel Ferrer are all great in various capacities. Criminal or greedy corporate leader - it's hard to tell which is which at times. A classic bit of sci-fi. Verhoeven has sadly not had a moment as fine as this since and has recently had problems being excessive in Hollywood - the land of excess! This is a landmark film that may not be to everyone's taste." "In theory, and from it's ridiculous title, Robocop is an incredibly silly film. The crime ridden streets of Detroit in the not-too-distant future, get a futuristic superhero, a knight in shining armour, from an omnipotent corporation OPC, to protect them from the criminals. However, what we actually get is a very emotional human story, along with some incredibly sharp satire. Murphy (Peter Weller), a police officer, is killed whilst on a mission with his new partner, Lewis (Nancy Allen). OCP (after a failed attempt at a robot-police programme) commissioned the Robocop program, and Murphy becomes the candidate. His memory is supposed to have been erased by the corporation however, he is reminded by Lewis of his identity. He pieces together the criminals that gunned him down after an incident with Emil (Paul McCrane), and uncovers the criminal machinations of corrupt, corporate business. As all good science fiction should, Robocop is partially allegorical of the times it was made in. In business, greed, power and wealth dominated (as highlighted in more explicit terms in another film of the same year, Oliver Stones Wall Street (1987), where \"greed is good\"). Here, violence and deceit are the tactics used to make it in the cut-throat business world. Miguel Ferrer's young, ambitious Bob Morton, and the older rival, Ronny Cox's Dick Jones, battle with each other to get their individual police-robot project's into production. Corruption was also an all pervading element of '80's business (something that was not new of course, we can go back in American history and find many corrupt governments and institutions, Tammany in New York is one example), and we see here the corporate elite working with the criminal underworld. The excesses of the 1980's greed is permeated within the excesses on screen. Violence is strong, yet comical at times. but it is always over the top. In an early scene, Dick Jones presents his product robot police officer, ED-209, a hulking, malevolent monster. In demonstration, ED-209 malfunctions and shoots an executive hundreds of times, to the point of joke. When Murphy is gunned down, we see his hand explode. Of course this reveals a corporate paranoia underneath some of the movies of the 80's. Each decades science fiction needs paranoia: In the 1950's and 60's it was communism and the nuclear bomb: in the 1970's and 80's it was political and corporate. The film is injected with some spot-on satirical humour. Adverts are seen throughout, further exacerbating the excesses of American culture at the time. We see commercials selling over-sized, gas guzzling automobiles (6000 SUX), replacement hearts (this clearly to alleviate the excesses on the body caused in the 80's), and a board game of the Battleship-kind (Nuke-Em). These along with the narrative create an almost perfect package. Directed by European Paul Verhoeven who epitomises the concept that the best way for America to hold a mirror up to itself, is to get outsiders to produce something that reflects the madness that was 1980's, Reagan-era, excess and greed. Not only does it offer a commentary, the humanistic, philosophical nature of the soul, is a strong (if often used) theme. Quite horrifically however, the film manifested into something terrible. I'm not talking about the sequels. The film was to be marketed for children, in the form of a cartoon series, and the inevitable action figures et al. So, like Gremlins (1984), this more \"adult\" fantasy, marketeers still had the moral sense (sic) to market violence to children - how lovely! www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "(www.plasticpals.com) RoboCop was one of the big hits of 1987, even though its title is a bit misleading (our hero is actually a cyborg, not a robot). It has much in common with the recent slew of comic super hero origin stories, but its R rating should not be taken lightly due to the shocking amount of gore. It's elevated above similar films through its satire of American culture, which include a number of broadcast news segments. Set in a crime-ridden future Detroit, a mega corporation wants to clean up the streets before they begin a massive building project. The corporation (OCP) is so huge that they have privatized the police force and have two separate robotics divisions working on automated solutions to Detroit's crime spree. One has developed a robot which malfunctions and subsequently obliterates an executive within the first ten minutes, and the other leads to the creation of RoboCop. The characters are almost totally one-dimensional, and we barely get to know officer Murphy before he undergoes his transformation. His character is further hampered because once Murphy's body is replaced with bionic parts, he doesn't speak very much. It doesn't work quite as well as in The Crow, another movie with a silent, seemingly invincible protagonist who has returned from the dead to seek revenge on those who murdered him. Most of the drama comes from the rivalry between two of OCP's executives, though there are some scenes where Murphy begins to remember his past life that give him some humanity. RoboCop's new abilities are surprisingly limited. Most of the time, the only thing that really distinguishes him from a human cop is his slow, deliberate walk and his bullet-proof armor. If made now, one would expect to see a much more agile and powerful version of the character. Now we've got movies like Iron Man, and video games like Deus Ex: Human Revolution which explore many of the same themes in a much more entertaining and intelligent fashion. That said, there's supposedly a remake in the works, which will be the 2nd Paul Verhoeven favorite to get the treatment after Total Recall (which is in production at the time of this writing). The core idea behind RoboCop isn't especially original, given that shows like The Six Million Dollar Man and characters like Darth Vader preceded it, but the way it all comes together is still pretty entertaining. There's some fun stop-motion animation effects for the ED 209 robot, and the hero is pure boyish wish fulfillment. Since its release RoboCop has become a cult classic amongst sci-fi film fans, and other than a few sequences where the image quality suffers, it holds up pretty well."

"*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "It's 24 years since I first saw this work at the movies and I'm still convinced it's very special. Paul Verhoeven brought to the screen a cyborg that was actually more believable than The Terminator. And although it wasn't an assassin; it didn't mess around either. That additional touch of humanity gave it great depth. He also assembled a B-movie cast that were perfectly matched and contrasted in characters & temperaments. They're the most naturally believable group of players. It's the future. And it's in Detroit, for a change. Paul Weller plays Murphy, a smart young cop trying to be a good husband and father-figure. During a heist he is ambushed by the villains and murdered. A high-tech corporation owns the franchise for law & order. They take his brain and fit it into a cybernetic body. Nancy Allen plays his partner and would-be friend, Lewis. Arch-crook who lead that ambush and most of Detroit's crimewave is Clarence Boddicker, played with wonderfully sleazy panache by Kurtwood Smith (a villain called Clarence?). Ronny Cox makes an equally greaseball executive insider. Dan O'Herlihy plays the corporate CEO. They, and a few others, are absolutely the business. Verhoeven's works are notoriously violent and this movie set his template. Yet, it's more than just violent; it's ironic and hilariously witty at times, though the comedy is often very dark. There's a host of memorable one-liners with hints of 'Dirty Harry'. But here, there's something else - a sly little comment about the relevance and even remanence of human identity. Post cyborg 'Robocop' Murphy, who is supposed to be a simple programme, begins having flashbacks. Soon, the greater part of his memory begins returning. In particular, recollections of his - now - widow, son and home re-surface. Verhoeven handles these curiously under-explored issues with quite an amazing subtlety. Murphy knows what he is. But now he must come to terms with what he's lost. Spielberg's 'Bicentennial Man' spent more than 2 hours and yet said nothing more. No one-issue dominates here. Verhoeven keeps the plot moving fast. With his re-awakening come memories of his murder. His cyborg half employs technology to trace the culprits, his human half wants revenge. On top of all this come special-effects that still hold good today. A shoot-out between himself and a giant robot inside the plush suite of executive offices is quite awesome. Whist slipped-in between takes, are spontaneous depictions of topical newscasts both hilarious & terrible. I've given this movie 10 stars because what it does, it does without flaw. It's seminally violent, hilarious, spontaneous, fast-moving, well-acted, smartly-scripted, untypically thought-provoking, with great special-effects. Finally; it's amalgamation of political prostitution, corporate cynicism, and tenuous morality is probably a closer representation of our dystopian future than many more celebrated works. This movie is a classic." "Possibly one of the best comic book adaptations of the 1980s wasn't even based on a comic property. Although he didn't get involved with the franchise until the second and third installments, comic legend Frank Miller's influence is smeared all over the first Robocop. Borrowing a heavy handed anti-establishment vibe, nacho cheesy looked-better-on-paper dialog, enough gratuitous violence to make a Troma flick turn away and stereotypical corporate bigwigs around every corner, I wouldn't be surprised to learn Miller had more than a passing investment in Paul Verhoeven's futurist nightmare. Of course, it could also be that Miller's influence on the comic medium as a whole was responsible for many of these parallels. Either way, it's a dream come true for fans of the dark, gritty graphic novels that made their mark in this era. It's also far from the most expertly crafted picture, with a carefree, cavalier attitude that seeps into the acting, cinematography, special effects and storyline. Arms are blown off just for the fun of it. Speeding automobiles barrel over evildoers in lieu of a more coherent way to write them out. Strongholds erupt into geysers of fire. As with Rambo before it, the lesson of the day is wanton brutality and the titular hero is your celebrated instructor. Despite its immeasurable shortcomings as a motion picture, that blunt approach to both villain and viewer alike makes it tough to turn off. A night with Robocop is like eating an entire bag of candies in one sitting; there's more nourishing, appetizing stuff out there and we know it's wrong... but sometimes it's impossible to fight that compulsion." "This movie predicted the merging of police and technology company 20 years before it happened. Now police profiling, and suspect location is a matter of technology with our chipped passports, and drivers license that can passively monitor our locations, and hold our biometric informations. Robocop is a product of OCP more so than its a police officer. This mars what \"justice\" is depending on who's view point it is. Alex Murphy gets murdered during investigation. OCP is looking for a \"brain\" that will emotionally survive its transplant into a cybernetic body. They find it in Murphy, and transforms him into Robocop. Murphy or Robocop goes about its business, but subliminally, it still harbors memory of its murder and family. He's on the chase of gangs that killed him. This results in investigation leading back to OCP, but will OCP allow its product to conduct police action on itself ? Ground breaking low budget science fiction thriller. Although there has been a cop turned into robot idea like the 8th Man by Jiro Kuwata, and Kazumasa Hirai, this is the first live action movie of its type. There're lot of what ifs that are explored in this movie, and the design of the technology is so good that it makes this movie believable. The movie had the sober look into the future society where corporate control influences the course of the society even more significantly than what was thought possible at the time, and present it in an entertaining action science fiction. In this sense, this movie scores high as we don't have Robocops yet, but our society is heading in that direction. Great movie that's exciting and believable with lot of drama all mixed in." "In a dystopic & crime ridden Detroit, a terminally wounded cop returns to the force as a powerful cyborg with submerged memories haunting him. One of the movies where your bored, want some entertainment, and a movie pops up wanting to be watched. You watch it, not expecting much, and results vary. Either the movie was expectantly bad or the movie actually draws you in with an intelligent plot that delivers in all sorts of ways, with amazing action and amazing scenes; the movie unexpectedly takes you by it's wheel and unexpectedly shocks you with true awesomeness. Oh yeah, Robocop is the second one. With a dystopic future and intelligent and highly possible ideas, Robocop actually scores in all ways possible. The action was piercing, Robocop gets the job done and it is overall amazing. This ties in equally with the foreshadowed special effects. From the older copy of Robocop, the technology was growing older and more developed. I was actually awe-inspired even seeing this in 2011, it is seriously awesome. The acting was alright, never expected high class and received. I loved the structure of the film as well, although meaningless, the film scatters news segments and TV commercials that tie-in with the plot. The beginning of Robocop's departure into law enforcement, the action gets gritter, the film gets meaner, and everything just tugs it way forward to even more awesome. Then we have the last thing that needs to be discussed: the heart. Wait, an action film like Robocop contains heart? Yes. And it works too, with Robocop's memory slithering it's way into his robotic mind, you can't help but to feel. Not like it's the main theme, but it is overgrowing and it unexpectedly worked for the film. I overall have no complains for the film, it was a totally unexpected masterpiece. Everything was done well, and it reaches peaks those held by the Terminator. Robocop is definitely not for everyone, but those who dislike, must reconsider their liking's; as Robocop is a must-see! 9/10." "I didn't really get a chance to watch this film when it came out and didn't got around to seeing it for a very long time. But because of all the hype it was getting I decided to watch it, I can now see why this movie has so many following. This is a brilliant sci-fi flick and the direction and pacing of it all is very well done and will keep most audiences attention despite it being a bit outdated. The special effects are outdated now, but the direction and how everything progresses makes the experience exhilarating and thrilling to watch. It even has some tension to some degree because of the set pieces and because of the attachment to the main character. This movie also has a lot of action sequences and those sequences are shot in a entertaining manner although a bit over the top at times. Any action movie fans or sci-fi fans should most definitely check this movie out. I also liked the commercial breaks in between some scenes in this that was meant for the movie because of it's humor, same with the broadcasts which adds to the movie in a positive way. 8.4/10" "\"Robocop\" is one of those great sci-fi movie's next to, \"Terminator\" and \"Star Wars\". The story is about a Rookie Cop that get's killed by gangsters and he end's up getting repaired by scientists and end's up becoming a police cyborg called, Robocop. What make's this movie really great is that it had some nice action scene's, the story was good, some nice acting from Peter Weller as the main protagonist and Kurtwood Smith(Who was known for playing Red in, \"That 70's Show\") as one of the villain's in the movie, and the movie had some funny moments that will make you laugh. Overall, \"Robocop\", is a great sci-fi movie to watch if you're into sci-fi movie's or trying to look for a good movie to watch." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "RoboCop is a great action flick! It is not for people who are faint of heart at all because this movie originally had an X rating for a reason, if there was NC-17 rating systems back then this movie definitely would have qualified for it. I won't get into details but this is definitely a hard rated R movie that children should not be allowed to see. Murphy's \"death\" scene near the beginning where he is cruelly gunned down and shot to pieces over a stretched out period of time by psychotic criminals (led by the dad from That 70s Show unbelievably) is hard to stomach. Also the scene near the end where one of the bad guy's henchmen is kind of melted by dangerous acidic chemicals then blows up when he is run over by a van is disgusting too. This movie doesn't pull any punches with the blood and gore quotient and there is also a lot of funny dark humour in it too. I love this flick but make sure to notice how blood and gutsy it is before you watch it!" "Science Fiction films have come a long way since the early days of movie making. Stories about alien or future worlds were more difficult to realize back then, but with advances in technology this would change. George Lucas's first 'Star Wars' film showed that so much more was possible and it was a sign of things to come. Had it never been made we wouldn't likely have films like 'Blade Runner,' 'Total Recall,' or 'Avatar,' or at least not for many more years. 'The Terminator' is another great example of this and introduced the world to what was probably the baddest cyborg to that date. Three years later we see the opposite side of this when a humble police officer was brought back as a kind of super cop to rid the modern world of \"waste.\" Instead of being a pale imitation of that earlier classic, 'Robocop' would become a hit in it's own right and remains one of the greatest of it's kind all these years later. Pros: Universally strong cast. Neat concept. Electrifying score. Awesome effects. Quick paced. Has a cool futuristic look and feel to it. Has quite a mean streak. Plenty of exciting and well staged action sequences. Fabulous direction. Has some great social commentary. Cons: Despite being set in the future, some things age the film. The effects that were added in post aren't so seamless anymore. Final thoughts: So many action packed movies lack heart, but 'Robocop' had more to offer than explosions, car chases, and gunfire. The character of the title is like a modern superhero and the film itself is an absolute smash. It easily deserves a spot in line with all the other great Science Fiction films. My rating: 4.5/5" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Excellent Action/Sci-fi/Drama. Plot: After being brutally killed by a gang of criminals, a cop is resurrected by a megacorporation,becoming a cyborg police officer to protect a futuristic Detroit. The memory of his family and his old life is erased, but somehow comes back to him over the course of the movie. How he died comes back to him which causes him to seek revenge. Directed by Paul Verhoeven(Total Recall, Basic Instinct, Showgirls, and Starship Troopers) the movie blends bloody action violence with elements of drama. Some of the parts are actually kind of sad. Robocop isn't just some cyborg who's only mind set is to protect and serve. He's trying to find his former identity.I thought that brought a lot more character depth. Peter Weller is awesome as Robocop/Alexander James Murphy. I was very surprised to see Kurtwood Smith in this. I've always known him as the hard*** dad from That 70's Show. The dialogue is funny but not bad just as Verhoeven's Starship Troopers(One of my favorite Sci-fi/Drama's of all time) and some of the deaths are so overdone they actually become funny." "After I watched RoboCop on TV, I loved it, but when I bought the DVD, I loved it even more!!!! Since I watched movies on TV, they attend to ruin certain dialog, they have to cut scenes out, dubbing, and content (ex. blood, gore, nudity, language, sexual references). But it's better to get them uncut to see the original movie. It stars Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, Dan O'Herlihy, Ronny Cox, Kurtwood Smith, Miguel Ferrer, etc. After Omni Consumer Products (OCP) announced that it bought out the Detroit police department, the department decides to go on strike. Alex Murphy (Peter Weller), gets transferred from Metro South to the West. He and his partner, Anne Lewis, track down a group of criminals led by Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith). Unfortunately, Murphy was killed by Clarence's gang. Bob Morton, one of OCP's employees, transforms Murphy's corpse into Robocop, to compete with another employee Dick Jones' ED-209. Robocop's tests are successful. Unfortunately, Robocop rediscovers his memories (when he was Alex Murphy), and now knows he has to find and arrest Clarence Boddicker. He realizes that Clarence is working for Bob Morton's competition Dick Jones. Now, Robocop must stop both Clarence and Dick Jones. As far as his directing goes, it was pretty good when he did Basic Instinct, his directing went downhill when he directed that awful movie Showgirls, but he returns to his roots by directing Starship Troopers. I have never owned the sequels, Never seen RoboCop 2, but I never liked RoboCop 3. Overall, one of the best action movies ever made. RoboCop gets 10 stars."

"*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "This is one of those movies that really embarrasses a lot of filmmakers. Robocop is the story of a police officer in a crime-ridden Detroit of the future who gets killed and turned into a cyborg law enforcer who must find those responsible for his death and reclaim his lost humanity. There have been hundreds, maybe a couple thousand, of sci-fi action movies where the basic premise of the story is at least as good as that. Yet, the overwhelming majority of those films suck really hard, while Robocop is one of the best action films of its era. In Robocop, a corporation called Omni Consumer Products is running the police force for the city of Detroit. The head of OCP (Michael O'Herlihy) wants to build a new development called Delta City in place of old Detroit, but first they need to find a way to control the raging crime wave that's crippling the city. The number 2 man at OCP is Dick Jones (Ronny Cox), but when his plan to patrol Detroit with robots fails spectacularly during a board meeting, ambitious young executive Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer) seizes the moment to get The Old Man to approve his alternative Robocop program. That program involves moving likely candidates on the police force into high crime, high violence precincts and waiting for one of them to die. The cop who gets \"lucky\" is Murphy (Peter Weller) by being horrifically gunned down by the charismatic crime boss of Detroit, Clarence Boddiker (Kurtwood Smith), and his gang. Murphy's corpse is claimed by OCP and transformed into Robocop, who launches a one-cyborg war on crime and becomes a media sensation. But then Murphy discovers the secrets behind OCP and his transformation and, with his old partner Lewis (Nancy Allen), brings the real bad guys to graphically violent justice. This is a great movie. The acting is great. The writing is great. T he direction is great. The costumes are great. The special effects (aside from some stop-motion animation that looks a little dated) are great. Robocop is one of the films that helped make the 1980s the Golden Age of the action movie. One of the best things about the film is the way the story deals with the concept of the super-human or the super-hero. Murphy is transformed by tragedy into something more than human, but the triumph of the character isn't in using his inhuman power to battle the bad guys, it's in his struggle to reassert his humanity. I once read a review that called Robocop one of the greatest super-hero origin stories ever because it recognizes and emphasizes that the important thing about the super-hero isn't the power or the costume or the codenameit's the real person inside all that. Robocop also has some of the best cultural commentary you'll ever see in an action movie. The movie creates and explores a wonderful contrast between the immorality of crime and the amorality of big business and makes you consider who is worse  those who deliberately set out to hurt people or those who just don't care who gets hurt in the pursuit of their agenda. Robocop is also notable for creating one of the most interesting \"worlds\" in sci-fi movie history. The corporatized, soulless society of future Detroit, the glimpses we get of the chaos elsewhere on Earth and the crude degeneracy of its popular culture are still compellingly perverse, even after 20+ years of the real world racing to catch up. If you like action movies, you have to see Robocop. Even if you don't like action movies, you should still watch Robocop, because if you don't like this film you can be sure you'll never like any action movie ever." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Set in the not too distant future, RoboCop is a dark satire of the media, corruption and the '80s boom of consumerism. Directed by Paul Verhoeven, it's got all of his trademarks, from explicit violence to groundbreaking special effects. I view RoboCop as sort of a prologue to Starship Troopers - we definitely see Verhoeven crafting his skills here, but this doesn't make it an amateur production - far from it. It's a basic story, which we've seen many times before - a cop, Alex Murphy, is almost killed by Clarence Bodicker, a bank robber with a foul mouth. We think he's dead - he is missing an arm, after all! He's revived by OCP, a mysterious corporation, who put him into a robotic body, the future in Law Enforcement. RoboCop isn't just a mindless action film - the storyline of OCP wanting to raze Detroit and build it again, parallels the refurbishment of towns in the early '80s, who wanted to make it more sophisticated. Overall, it's a nice change from the usual mindless action film, with nice hints of drama and satire. If you're looking for more, definitely see RoboCop 2, but you should probably skip number 3, where it all became a bit silly." "Robocop is easily a masterpiece of science fiction/action cinema and is possibly one of, if not the best sci-fi films along, in my opinion, with T2. The action scenes, especially RoboCop's final showdown with ED-209. The music is entertaining and fits the atmosphere of the film. And another thing I love is, a thing which is even more present in the X/NC-17 rated version of the film: the grittiness of not only the violence, but the film in general. The dark comedy is fitting, pops up at the appropriate times, and is actually quite funny. Peter Weller gives a tour de force performance as RoboCop. Even though you rarely see his face or him as a human, this film would undeniably not be the same without Weller as the titular character. Clarence Boddicker is also one of the greatest villains ever to be portrayed on the screen. All around, this film excels in everything a good action/sci-fi film should have: action, great CGI, great writing/directing, acting, music, atmosphere, a believable and frightening villain, a real plot, interesting setting, and something recent sic-fi/action flicks have been lacking; charm, heart, and wit." "Paul Verhoeven's greatest film to date, even better than Starship Troopers and Total Recall. The film later spawned a T.V. series and an animated cartoon series. Robocop is followed by Robocop 2 and Robocop 3. The sequels are AMAZINGLY NOT DIRECTED BY P. Verhoeven but by different directors and (sadly) not as good as the original. Plot: Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) a transferred Officer, just arrived at Detroit P.D. is told to suit up, meet with his new partner Officer Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen) and head out on patrol. On patrol they encounter Clarence Bodicker (Kurtwoord Smith in his most iconic role as a baddie) and his goons. They track him down to an abandoned factory, and enter it. Murphy is separated from his partner Lewis. He is caught by Bodicker's Goons and literally shot to pieces. His is airlifted to a hospital, but his wounds are too great and he expires. His body however is transferred discreetly to Omni Consumer Products (O.C.P) and they have a different agenda on their minds for Murphy...................... Watch this exciting film to find out. A must have film for any DVD collection." "In the 80's sci-fi/action classic, \"Robocop,\" Peter Weller plays newbie cop Alex Murphy, whom, after being ruthlessly gunned down by a crime boss and his cronies, is resurrected as a cyborg. As Robocop, Murphy is the ultimate in law enforcement, cleaning the streets of a crime-ridden Detroit (in a not too distant future that we have likely surpassed by now) all while being haunted by some unpleasant memories. \"Robocop\" is the breakthrough film from director Paul Verhoeven, whose reign over the action genre was short-lived but certainly left a mark. Like all of his best films, it pushes the envelope and the limits of good taste, all in the name of good entertainment. Verhoeven combines a bit of social commentary with his high-energy, over-the-top style, but thankfully, it still makes for a film that can be appreciated on a superficial level, too. It's just that \"Robocop\" matches its giddy goriness and intense action with some unexpected substance, and that's okay. All of this is achieved, of course, with the assistance of some solid special effects, stop-motion animation that surprisingly still looks good and a score that sticks in your head for days. In all honesty, though, there isn't much going in the character department. Peter Weller pulls through, and in spite of the fact that he isn't given much to do besides walk around in an obviously uncomfortable and cumbersome outfit, still manages to bring a human element to his Robocop counterpart. Kurtwood Smith (TV's \"That 70's Show\") lays it on a little thick as the main baddie but keeps the energy pumping through its final act, while Paul McCrane (TV's \"ER\") has perhaps the most memorable (read: revoltingly awesome) scene in the film. Verhoeven paces the film just right so that you don't have time to notice its lack of substantial characters and all you can do is just sit back and enjoy the ride. And what a great ride it is, as in spite of its minor flaws, \"Robocop\" still holds up and manages to entertain after all these years." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "\"Dick! You're Fired\"..... And so the plot of Robocop reaches it's zenith when Ronny Cox , \"meets his maker\" courtesy of an angry boss, a very angry cyborg and a classic \"Wilhelm Scream\"! Watching Robocop again in 2008 for the first time in maybe 20 years, I found it to be a thoroughly entertaining piece of work from director Paul Vorhoeven. No need to write too much here suffice to say that the best line comes at the end of the film when the aforementioned Mr Cox falls to his death(very similar to Frank Nitti'e death in The Untouchables, also a 1987 film!)after being blasted by Peter Weller's title character. Great performances from all concerned. Also terrific to see Miguel Ferrer with a full head of hair!!" "one of the funniest and most outrageously violent sci fi action pics; this deservedly classic piece of mayhem confirms the marvellously talented dutch film director paul verhoeven as a force to be reckoned with. special mention must be given to the dialogue (\"YOU CALL THIS A GLITCH!\" after a test robot riddles an excessive amount of bullets into an employee at a company conference) and hilarious swipes at corporate management (ticker tape share readings in the restroom). viva la' robocop!" "I hadn't seen this before because I thought the special effects would not be to good since it is an older movie. But, I was pleasantly surprised. Robocop looked cool. And the ED-209 machine did look really fake compared to today's effects,but it still wasn't bad. The satire, such as the TV commercials, throughout the movie was great. And I had no idea how violent and bloody this was or I would have seen it earlier. And the way the bad guys kill Murphy so he can become robocop is so disturbing because of their attitudes, just laughing and joking while someone gets their arm blown off. They definitely deserve what they got in the end. FINAL VERDICT: Your classic tale of revenge; this time with a half human/robot cop. Bloody violent, bloody good." "The perfect role for the young Leeza Gibbons: a completely superficial and insensitive TV news reader. For her, the movie was a foreshadowing. Miguel Ferrer sets the tone for his desultory career as the infamous Bob Morton. Who can forget the geeky bad guy who gets obliterated by the car after being dipped in toxic waste? Ka-blew-ie!!! Ewwwwwwwww!! And last but certainly not least: \"I'll buy THAT for a dollar!!\"" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** RoboCop(1987) on one level is an allegory on the death and rebirth of Jesus Christ. Its a topic that has been a fascination for artists almost more than anything else. Art's interest in the death and rebirth of Jesus is a continuous one. One of Paul Verhoeven's dream projects is to do a film on the topic of Jesus. The 4th Man(1984) also in certain moments was obsessed with the Jesus allegory presented in RoboCop(1987). Story makes many references to Jesus and Franenstein tales. After building up an impressive resume as an European cult film director, Paul Verhoeven in the mid 1980s decided to make it a try at Hollywood. RoboCop(1987) was his first and best Hollywood feature. When he made this, Paul Verhoeven showed some promise as a filmmaker who could take chances with taboo subject matters in Hollywood. American films since RoboCop(1987) have been dissapointments especially Starship Troopers(1997) and Hollow Man(2000). One exception of a good Hollywood film besides RoboCop(1987) is Total Recall(1990). It always saddens me when excellent foreign filmmakers(for most part) who come to Hollywood end up making mediocre films. RoboCop(1987) might have not been possible without box office success of The Terminator(1984). Like most things in cinema one form of movie always gives way to another. An interesting tidbit on RoboCop is that Arnold Schwarzenegger was considered as a canidate for main role. Due to the fact that Arnold was too big to fit into the RoboCop suit, the filmmakers went for Peter Wellar instead. RoboCop(1987) and The Terminator(1984) are two of the most influential SCIFI films of the 1980s. Look of the latter film is apparent in set designs of former. Violence in feature is shown with a dark humor approach. There are a few instants when violence enters the realm of comic books with over the top presentation. Disturbingly humorous is what I call the death of Kenny moment. Violent scenes are flamboyantly filmed by Paul Verhoeven. Some of the gore scenes are in the style of Lone Wolf and Cub, and Lucio Fulci. Daring way of showing violence that many in today's Hollywood would never do. A fun part in watching it is the cold blooded villainous performance of Kurtwood Smith. He plays his character with ability to act brutish and look intellectual at same time. You never would think just by looking at Clarence Boddicker with his bookish looks that he is a foul mouth murderer. Its funny to know that vicious bad guys are usually played by nice guys. Michael Ironside plays the same sort of character in Total Recall(1990). Editing of RoboCop(1987) is fantastic especially during the Mediabreak moments. Tangled in the satiric and violent web is a tragic tale of rediscovery. Focuses on a man who loses all that is precious to him including his human ways. The robotized Murphy is in essence in the same path as the replicants of Blade Runner(1982). Deals with similar ideas about identity and memory as Total Recall(1990). Identity and what it means to a person is the most important theme of RoboCop(1987). The main protagonist does at least get a portion of his past life which seemed lost to him. Mediabreak sequences are interludes to the main action of the plot. Mediabreak sequences and the commercials that follow them provide a humorous truth about American culture. The funniest commercial presented in the parody of the Battleship boardgame. Nancy Allen is excellent in what I think is her best role. Ronny Cox is menacing as the ruthless executive, Dick Jones. Miguel Ferrer does well in the role of the ambitious and arrogant Bob Morton. Aspect of RoboCop that story zeros in on is the dual nature of main character once he's transformed into RoboCop. Its at the moment of a dream that RoboCop begins to wonder about who he is. Peter Weller brings a lot of depth into the role to make Alex Murphy a tragic hero. Alex Murphy's death is shocking because of the way he's killed. As gruesome and over the top as any death scene in a Lucio Fulci film from the early 1980s. Its the kind of death scene one usually reserves for the end of a film. Works as a satire on the attitude and excess of the 1980s. Yuppie culture in RoboCop(1987) is shown as arrogant and obnoxious. 1980s culture has never been protrayed with the humorous edge lacking in most films about 1980s culture with exception of Heathers(1989). Rob Bottin provides some gruesome but impressive makeup effects for RoboCop. Ranks among Bottin's best work as makeup effects man alongside The Howling(1980), and The Thing(1982). Rob Bottin's effects for Murphy's bloody demise rivals anything by Tom Savini or Gianetto De Rossi. A subtle moment is when Murphy/RoboCop shoots at bottles of baby food wi help of his partner for aim. It represents the fact that RoboCop can never have children or have an intimate relationship with Lewis. A couple of action scenes are in the fashion of Hong Kong Heroic Bloodshed pics. RoboCop(1987) is made up of memorable set pieces which have their own impressive signature. Peter Weller's performance as a robot who regains his human face preemits Arnold Schwarzenegger's development of human traits in Terminator 2:Judgement Day(1991). One of the ten great SCIFI films made during the 1980s."

"I was thoroughly impressed when I first saw this in theaters and couldn't wait to get it on video. Nothing but eye candy from start to finish depicting a futuristic Detroit as both sterile and grimy (thanks to the Dallas and Pittsburgh filming locations). But I hate to say that today the film has lost a little of its punch and the special effects are obviously those of minatures rather than computer graphics. All the performances were outstanding, but the one I absolutely loved was Kurtwood Smith as Clarence, one of the greatest villains in movie history. He's not presented as some ugly, evil slimeball, but a very intelligent, slightly-built, soft-spoken, balding man with a violent streak. The action and settings are so comic book-like and even better, 80's corporate greed is satirized more than any film I've seen. Looking back, I wonder exactly the time period it's set in since everything is futuristic except the automobiles, but then again, I viewed it as a parody of 80's society. I've loved Paul Verhoeven's films before this (not his later ones except Total Recall and Starship Troopers), especially The Fourth Man and Soldier of Orange. I always found his casting choices to be odd, because he chooses actors, well known or unknown to star in his big-budget films. I thought his acting stock from Holland would have been perfect for this film; think about it: Rutger Hauer as Murphy/Robocop, Renee Soutendijk as Lewis, and Jeroen Krabbe as Dick Jones or Clarence. They have played Americans quite well before (strange since their native tongue is foreign), but I suppose Verhoeven knew what he was doing in this one. Forget the sequels, they were about the worst in history." "ROBOCOP is a great action movie, it's one of the best ever. I was a little too young when I first saw it on TV, but I've always liked it. This movie has great acting & great action & great direction which makes me proud to be half dutch! If you haven't seen, get it on DVD, it's Verhoeven's best! (not like HOLLOW MAN, that stupid movie.)" "This movie is great ! The director is great (he also make \"Basic Instinct\" and \"Showgirls\").It is very original , it is a thriller , SF , and is very violent too. It is much better than the sequels ...YOU WILL LOVE IT !!!!!" "RoboCop is one of the greatest action movies ever made. It was probably one of the most violent too. But it's one of those movies which the violence fits in really well with the plot. It takes place in the future, where Detroit is overrun by a major corporation, OCP, who just bought the police department and created a crime-fighting android that went horribly wrong. But to compensate for it, an executive creates RoboCop out of policeman Alex Murphy who was brutally gunned down by a gang of vicious cop killers. RoboCop goes on a streak of crime-fighting with great success but then he gets flashbacks of his human life and his main priority is to take out the men who killed him. But he doesn't know that those criminals are better protected than he thought. RoboCop is a definite triumph in action movies. I first saw this movie on ABC back in the late 80's and then rented afterwards and the amount of violence was much more extreme than it was on TV. It has great visual effects and sound(RoboCop has the coolest sounding gun in movie history). Unlike other reviewers I don't believe you should completely avoid the sequels, I thought they were good but I agree that they weren't as good as the first one. If it was still on, I would recommend seeing the TV show. Not one to miss but also not for the weak-stomached. 10/10" "The future is bleak. Street crime is spinning out of control and the police are losing officers at an alarming rate. Until more is done to support them, they are actually contemplating striking. Their job has gotten way too deadly. This is Detroit, the recent future. In an effort to provide the police with more funding, the city has allowed a private conglomerate, OCP, to buy the police department. OCP, a corporation which specializes in dabbling in public services (this is where the money is to be made-weapons for the military, medical services and supplies, etc.), has an interest in controlling crime. Not cleaning up crime, but controlling crime. See, there is also big money to be made by accepting kick-backs. OCP has also committed millions, possibly billions of dollars to a major urban renewal project known as Delta City (\"The Future Has A Silver Lining\" reads a billboard which towers over an attempted rape). Nobody will live or work there if crime can't be controlled. And the investment is lost. OCP has a plan. Create the perfect cop. The assignment has been given to OCP second Dick Jones (Ronny Cox), a ruthless man his subordinates would never want to cross. However, his ED-209 program is not entirely practical. Seeing his chance, Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer), ambitious junior executive, picks up the ball and runs with it. Bob convinces \"The Old Man\" (Dan O'Herlihy) that his RoboCop plan is better. All he is waiting for is a cop to, how do we say, expire in the line of duty, which should happen any day now as he has restructured the police department to increase the risk of unknowing likely candidates. Bob is waiting for a \"volunteer\". And Dick Jones is not happy about any of this. This is the world director Paul Verhoeven has fashioned in his ultra-violent, wickedly funny (yes, funny!) \"RoboCop\". Everyone is in it for \"me\", greed is worn on the sleeve, and force is the way to get it. The screenplay, penned by Michael Miner and Edward Neumeier, is sharply written social commentary on everything from workplace politics to television (there are periodic recurring shots of different characters watching the same moronic TV comedy show which seems to be on at all hours, all days, all channels!). The pacing is quick, the action is graphic (mostly gunshot wounds), the camera use and production design is stylish. The music, composed by Basil Poledouris (\"Red Dawn\", \"The Hunt For Red October\", \"Starship Troopers\") is gripping. The acting is top notch by a group of veteran supporting character actors. Peter Weller, as Officer Alex Murphy, the \"volunteer\", is perfect for the role as a good family man caught in the middle of a situation he never expected. And Kurtwood Smith (\"That '70's Show\") as Clarence Boddicker, local crime boss who wants to control it all, is excellent. \"RoboCop\" is not typical sci-fi/sci-fantasy fare. There is real intelligence going on behind this script. Although set in the recent future, there is much for us to relate to now. Is this film a prophetic message? I don't know. But what I do know is that Paul Verhoeven's \"RoboCop\" is a very thrilling, enjoyable, stylish comic book on celluloid." "This one's a bit personal since I studied screenwriting under Michael Miner, one of Robocop's two creators. I remember seeing this film long before ever knowing one of its writers and I was impressed by the way the writers cloaked a message under a great deal of sci-fi technology and action. Sure, it was one vision of the future, but with the way technology was and is going coupled with the way corporate America wishes to control it, who's to say something like this futuristic world, gripped with crime could not happen? However, through it all, good still seems to survive and sometimes conquer insurmountable odds. Also, Robocop, the device created by the corporate greed machine, became an instrument for what was good and right. It even turned on the corporate types who would seek to use it for less than rightful purposes. I must admit that I recognize THIS film as the only Robocop saga worth mentioning. All of the others strayed from the creators' original vision." "I saw this film for the second time on television and although it portrayed a good idea based on a number of earlier man-made robotic super heroes, as with many such sci-fi films there is too much reliance on effects and not enough on the story. I fear that producers and scriptwriters seem to think that people who watch such films lack intelligence when quite the reverse is true. The idea that robots could one day be used to carry out law-enforcement may be a possibility but I suspect genetic engineering may take us in another direction when criminal tendency will be eliminated from humans when those all important genes will be modified, but then other forms of human failing will have to be treated. But that assumes that we shall not be replaced by robots for everything. The Robocop ends up being the good guy who kills the bad guy and the bad robot and who lives to make Robcop 2 and 3. The question that will always be asked is who decides what is good and right, the programmer or as one day he will be, the robot programmer who makes his descendents? But then that's been dealt with in the Exterminator films, or has it?" "Most of guys who did not see Verhoeven's previous Dutch films, could not say anything but action-packed or allegory of modern capitalism from RoboCop. His personal career- Doctoral degree of Science from Leiden, Seaman of Royal Dutch Navy, and radicalist in Dutch National Broadcasting Station- is flourished by his second work in the States. He has been continuously criticizing the absurdity of modern capitalism, world subordination theory, and partially the weird feeling of sexual oppression which everybody could experience in front of his/her personal encounter of momentum in his life history. Actually, the RoboCop is to satisfy the most simple audience who could not be fed up with violence and scientific mirage. However, that is just a matter of drawing full support from major studio (whether from the Orion or not). He depicted every tenet he eagerly wanted through his early Dutch works, and he succeeded!! Now that he succeeded in expressing what he wanted to, there is no reason for him to stick to the stinky sequels. That is why he refused the RoboCop 2" "It's the first time I give a 5 to a movie and still I have a little doubt in my mind. Not about the film in itself which is, in the science-fiction category, a must-have. The problem is elsewhere. In Robocop, you will see three different worlds pictured : a) The world of the leaders where iron (polished) and money reign. b) The world of the gangsters where iron (rotted) and guns reign. c) The world of the police related heroes where iron (Robocop) and friendship reign. And between or outside these worlds : nothing or almost nothing. A wife who disappears as soon as her husband dies, wars or tragedies you can only watch through controlled TV channels. To try to pass from a world to another is nothing but safe. In fact, death waits for you in this no-man's land. Except for Robocop. What the hell does Paul Verhoeven try to tell us by picturing this claustrophobic vision of the future ? That our future lies in a clear separation between economic or ethnic groups ? That only a charismatic and heartless leader will able to control the situation ? Frightful perspective, isn't it ? Or rejoicing view of the mind, Paul? O.K. I'm through. Let's just enjoy the show ! Action, good actors and beautiful gunfights. Who can ask for anything more ? WOW !" "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "After OCP announces that its bought out the Detroit police department, the department decides to go on strike. Alex Murphy gets transferred from Metro South to the West. He and his partner, Anne Lewis, track down a group of criminals led by Clarence Boddicker. Unfortunately, Murphy is killed by Clarence. Bob Morton, one of OCP's employees, transforms Murphy's corpse into Robocop, to compete with Dick Jones' ED-209. Robocop's tests are successful but, he begins to rediscover memories, and now knows he has to find and arrest Clarence Boddicker. He discovers that Clarence is working for Dick Jones. Now, Robocop must stop both Clarence and Dick Jones...... Take whatever you want from Robocop, be it a metaphor for Jesus Christ, or a huge middle finger to private companies buying the world for ownership, its an amazing movie, and a timeless classic. Seller is great as the titular character, and he puts some real effort in once he is transformed,you really do forget that Weller is in the suit, and get lost into the whole cyborg thing. If you want to go along the Christ metaphor, he dies, gets resurrected, and for added effect, he walks on water, and Jones could be classed as Gabriel, his all from grace, depicted when the old man (god) fires him. It works in a sense, but doesn't hinder the flow of the narrative. The supporting cast are brilliant, and kudos to Smith, Cox, and McCrane for putting some of their best work in this movie. Set pieces are brilliant, and there really isn't much apart from the action in the movie, unless you count Verhoevens little stab at consumerism, with his little ad breaks. All in all, it's a brilliant almost perfect dystopian vision, very topical, very funny, and unbelievably, very real. One of the most important films released in the eighties."

"Though not as good as The Terminator, Robocop is solid. and if you haven't seen it yet, you really should. Set in Detroit in the not too distant future, officer Alex Murphy is killed in the line of duty one day, but he is brought back to life as a cyborg. He becomes the city government's latest experiment in law enforcement. For a while he does his duty without question, but he slowly gains memories of his old 'human' personality including his partner, his family, and more importantly his killers. When he goes after them, he discovers that they are working for a crooked government official. Our robo-hero must bring justice to the city. Robocop is a good blend of all the right elements, never getting to absurd or too dull. Up until the last five minutes, I didn't question the improbabilities of the movie, but the ending is not only too short and abrupt but it's silly. Unlike Terminator, It is a poor conclusion to the story, but knowing that the filmmakers had a sequel in mind (or even two) I suppose this error is forgivable. Coming from Paul Verhoeven, one should not be surprised that Robocop is a little more violent than it is suspenseful, but this is his most accomplished picture, and if there are any major flaws, than they will probably go unnoticed. Hurray for Robocop!" "I remember being about 15 and going to my local store and getting this film for the first time from a store that was known for giving films of a certain certificate to under age people (let's face it most of them did) and my 1st thought being what a fantastic film. Its only since i've got older that I have realised the message in the film is quite a bleak one. It is saying that if we continue in the direction we are taking as a world we will end up with lawless societies and basically global Armageddon. The story is directed by Paul Verhoeven (who else for such a task) and told in a dark and uncompromising fashion with excellent performances from Peter Weller and Nancy Allen (until then mainly known for being the chief bitch in Carrie) but all involved play their parts extremely well. The directors cut is the definitive version of this film as it adds more depth to the story and explains it better. It really is a classic of its genre and many films have tried to copy it but none can compare. Fantastic." "***1/2 Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, Dan O' Herlihy, Kurtwood Smith, Ronny Cox and Miguel Ferrer. Directed by Paul Verhoever. The smash hit for sci-fi geeks and a movie for cops too, grisly and fascinating at the same time non-stop action with a few catchy lines in the mix. New comer police officer Alex Murphy (Weller) hot on the trail of bank robber Clarince Bobbicker (Smith; a role born to play) is soon bombarded by bullets and left for dead. Soon after high authority suit types decide to make him the ultimate law enforcer Robocop (Weller). Going through some nasty crimes and upholding the law everywhere he goes and piecing together who he really is, Robocop has become a science fiction phenomenon. Taking pieces of grunge cop \"Dirty Harry\" with the unstoppable metallic armor of James Cameron's \"The Terminator\". Kick-ass flick for the eighties and a life teaching lesson for crooks and criminals. My final rating 8/10." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "RoboCop is arguably one of the best cyborg movies of all time. Peter Weller's performance as RoboCop is touching and tough at the same time. The rest of the cast, Nancy Allen, Robert DoQui, Miguel Ferrer give great performances along with the villainous Kurtwood Smith (RoboCop's murderer), Ray Wise and the sadistic Ronny Cox who plays the corrupt OCP businessman Dick Jones, he steals the show and in many ways is more evil than Kurtwood Smith. RoboCop starts with the police force considering going on strike, and then Alex Murphy (aka RoboCop) comes in the scene. Whilst out on patrol with his new partner (Lewis), they chase a group of heavily armed bank robbers to an old mill. They split up, and Murphy is blown away (quite literally) by the crooks. You can guess the next bit, he's brought back as RoboCop, and starts going out and fighting crime, until he starts to remember parts of his past and goes out looking for answers as to his identity. The film has some very good yet dark humour. The news and advertisement brakes take a comical yet dark look at American society. RoboCop addresses big issues, such as the American society, the human sole, and the role of a police officer. Another great thing about this film was the way that OCP (the main company in the story, the ones that put RoboCop together) is portrayed. It is shown as a corrupt products company with all the members trying to kill each other. Literally. But the whole thing is headed by an old man that seems to have some integrity, only to be out shined by the sinister Dick Jones. However the film is does have some problems. . The script in some places isn't very good, but it's not as bad as it could have been. The Special effects are pretty lame, but this was made almost twenty years ago, and the film didn't have a very big budget, so I'll let this one off. Probably the biggest problem was the violence. Okay, its a movie about crime and cyborg, and of course there is going to be some violence in here. But it's just plain excessive at many points, particularly were Murphy gets killed. It's just not necessary and appalling for it to be that violent. But Paul Verhovan's film making makes all these problems seem not as bad as you would really think. He makes a masterpiece. RoboCop, in my opinion, is better than ANY of the Terminator films, however as a series, the Terminator wins on a forfeit. The original RoboCop is probably the only film in the series worth watching. RoboCop 2 did have a lot going for it, but poor film making just ruined it. THe only way to describe RoboCop 2 is...well, a mess. The plot is allover the place. And RoboCop 3, don't even get me started on RoboCop 3. Verdict. RoboCop is by far one of the best films of our time, however the appalling levels of violence is keeping me from giving this film a 10. 8/10." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "I have always been ambivalent towards the films of Paul Verhoeven. In my personal experience, his work has been marred by his excesses. Don't get me wrong; I like sex and violence in movies as much as anyone else, but this guy really overdoes it. His worst film to date, \"Showgirls,\" wallows in sensationalism for its own sake; he includes plenty of nudity but barely any plot to speak of. However, he found a solid middle ground in \"Robocop,\" my favorite of his films thus far. While it contains as much violence as you'd expect (more if you watch the director's cut), it's counterbalanced by a well-crafted storyline, a compelling \"man vs. machine\" theme, and even some social criticism. This is not an entirely serious science-fiction movie. It is as much a social satire as anything else. This aspect of the film is established from the start with the first of many jabs at media and corporate culture. A very cynical view is taken of such institutions, which are seen as corrupt to the core. The satiric elements were necessary to offset the brutality of many scenes. Otherwise, it would have been too bleak and nasty to recommend, a problem that would plague its first sequel. The cold-blooded murder of the protagonist, a dedicated police officer, is extremely graphic and brutal, even for Verhoeven. This scene, and the character's subsequent resurrection as Robocop, is highly riveting. There are other gruesome scenes, sufficiently graphic to originally warrant an X rating from the MPAA. Even now, this comes off as a borderline NC-17 movie. I was intrigued by the central dilemma facing Robocop; although much of his original memory was purged, he still retains enough of his humanity to realize who he is and what's become of him. In one of the most compelling scenes, he accesses the crime database to identify his previous incarnation--and his killers. His mission becomes purely personal, conflicting with his new programming. At one point, he visits his former home (now up for sale), haunted by memories of his past family. He remembers what OCP wanted him to forget; how can he proceed with this newfound knowledge? This type of movie needs a good villain. Kurtwood Smith is more than up to the task; his character, a ruthless drug lord, is extremely vicious and nasty, even for an action villain. In one early scene, he throws his henchman out of a getaway truck just to throw off his pursuers. When he murders Robocop's old human self, he is genuinely enjoying his actions, the mark of a true sadist. In a later scene, Robo returns to give him a good beating, and the scene is one of pure satisfaction to the viewer, as comeuppance is imposed on a character who truly deserves it. Another good supporting performance comes from the solid Nancy Allen as the protagonist's former partner, who is the first to recognize him, and eventually proves to be his salvation. As the title character, Peter Weller is adequate, though countless other performers would have done just as well in the role. Verhoeven's vision of the future is a bleak, dystrophic urban wasteland, a shadow of Detriot's former glory as a major industrial city. At times it even seems like a postapocalyptic setting. He keeps the film moving at a thrill-a-minute pace, yet allows for the human elements of the story to shine through, delivering a movie that is more than just another generic thriller. It's most glaring flaw is not quite knowing how to end. The bad guy bites the dust, and Robocop gets his revenge; yet it isn't quite worthy of what went on before. *** (out of ****) Released by Orion Pictures" "Robocop is way better and more violent than the Terminator. It was very interesting, and more sci-fi than the sequels. But it is a classic, and it's going to stay that way, plus the special effects were pretty good for it's 1987 year and a cheap movie company known as Orion Pictures." "Over the top action comedy is drop dead hilarious such as when Bobby is thrown from the van or Murphy having his hand blown off & when the assistant is shot several by Ed-209.The movie also has funny one liners:''What is this sh*t !''. Rating:***** (out of five)" "Robocop is an awesome movie. It is probably one of the most graphically violent ever. I saw it when I was eight in the theater and for years dreamt of one day making a movie as violent. Sure it has minimal plot and only tolerable acting but you can't get a much more entertaining movie. Dutch director Paul Verhoeven who's directing has also brought us Total Recall and Starship Troopers has his finger on the pulse of what young American males want to see. The extreme violence in this movie is occasionally broken up by moments of sheer brilliant humor. Such as the mock commercials. I'm not a supporter of DVD but my friend has one and he got the director's cut of Robocop for even more violence. Either way this movie rocks." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Robobcop is the greatest film ever. Time travelling robots, car chases, head disasters,guts, killings, excitements, great graphics. As many have reviewed it, I'll give a plot summary and offer my favourite quotings. It's the future. Crime is everywhere, cops are overrun. Bad guys rule the cops. Everyone watches silly TV shows involving cakes and breasts: Bixby: I'd buy that for tree fiddy! Murph joins the cops. On his first day he is murdered by baddies. In an exhilarating chase the baddie boss sacrifices one of his own men:Clarence: Can you fly, Blobby? Smurf catches a couple of the bad guys, but the tables turn when he is outnumbered: Emil: (pointing a shotgun at Murphy) Your hide is mine! Clarence: No. Nat ya da da! Lead baddie Clarence Bodyguard gives his reasons for massacre:Clarence: See, I got this problem, so I do. I don't like cops so I don't. NANANANANANA! (blowing Murphy's hand off) Clarence: Not so handy now, are ya? This is all very amusing so one of the camp bad guys quips: Joe: Ooh I bet that's gotta sting, well you see now that's the thing, 'bout being shot 300 times. Ooh my boys, he speaks, he rhymes! Morse dies while his partner Lewis watches. Campy Joe quips as they leave: Joe: Nighty night, sleep well my friend. Oops, that's right, you're bucking dead! The company which looks after the city's police force, OCD, has been looking for new ways to solve crime. Dick Johns has created a monster called Ed20head which he believes will work. He presents it to the committee in a delightful scenario which reminded me of school drama club: (Kinney points a pistol at ED209) ED: Please put down your weapon. You have 20 seconds to comply. Dick: Do as he says. (Kinney drops the pistol but ED advances) ED: What did I just say, scumbag? Kinney: I did what you said. I did what you said! ED: Oh, back chat me will you? (ED opens fire and shreds Kinney) Dirk's boss is very disappointed at this glitch. Up and comer Bob Monkhouse steps up to the dish and offers his solution- a time travelling robot they captured which can be reprogrammed with the mind of a dead cop. Dick (secretly the crime lord boss) isn't happy. They use Murray's Brain: Bob: You're gonna be a bad mother-crusher! He's unstoppable. All he needs is 12 hours sleep a day, and a special type of robot food: Johnson: Tastes like baby food! Morton: I prefer rusks. He follows set orders: Morton: What are your Prime Directives? Robo: Shooting bad guys in the balls, eating baby food, your clothes, your boots, and your motorcycle. Robo immediately gets to work on killing criminals and saving the day creating his own classic quotes along the way: Robo: You feel lucky, Creep? Well, do ya? Robo: Thank you for your cooperation. Adios! Robo: Dead or alive, you are going to die. He is an internet sensation, bigger than the Beaters: Reporter: Excuse me, Robo, any special message for all the kids watching at home? Robo: Stay away from my bins. Dick's angry that his plan for world domination has been destroyed. He speaks to Bob about respect before having him killed: Dick: I used to call the old man funny names. Smelley pants. Boner. Once I even called him...\"Bum face.\" Murphy has been having nightmares about being killed, and decides to go after the gang: (Dragging Leon Nash by the hair) Robo: Who killed Laura Palmer? This leads to a shootout with motorcycles, helicopters, and sharks in a warehouse: Robo: Come quietly or there will be... trouble. Steve: Oh... yeah? (cocks shotgun)Hasta la vista, baby! (fires) Clarence was celebrating his birthday and is surprised by all the presents: Clarence: Oooh. buns, buns, buns! He isn't happy when Robert arrests him, but knows his rights: Clarence: Just give me my funning phone call. He phones Dick who says Robobo must be killed. He gives Clarence new guns so they can kill Robotinator: Joe: Whoa, a new toy. Can I play? Clarence: Buy your own, hippy. Robo finds them and begins his final confrontation with the help of Louise. Campy Joe is his first victim: Robo: Looking for me? (shoots Joe)Does it hurt? Does it hurt? He drops Emilio into a vat of Toxic Waste (he returns in the sequel as bad guy The Jokey Man): Emil: (after taking an acid bath) It Burns! He kills Clarence and the rest of the gang but Louie is hurt: Lewis: Murphy... I'm a mess... Robo: Soiling oneself is a common problem in earthlings. Robo goes to OCD headquarters to arrest Dick, but can't due to a fourth directive in his database. Dick explains his actions: Dick: I had to kill Bob Morton because he made a mistake. Now it's time to erase that mistake. (Attacks Robo with an eraser on the end of a giant pencil) The Wee Man realises what has been happening: Old Man: Dick, you're fired! (Directive 4 is cancelled) Robo: Dick, you're fired! (shoots Jones) Due to budget constraints the following quote was left in as they couldn't afford to re-film it: Old Man: Nice shooting, son. What's your name? Robo: em. Paul Weller? Best Scene: When Robo sticks the metal blade out of his arm through a robber who dared to steal a carton of milk. It goes through the carton, through bad guy's mouth, and out the back of his head!" "If \"Robocop\" was first released today, it would probably not create much fanfare. However, when it was launched in 1987, \"Robocop\" became a true legend: Everybody had at least heard the term \"robocop\" coined in the synonymous film, a term that gradually became a part of everyday slang. As for the film itself, it proved to be a huge success, it set a new trend in action films, and it was followed by (unfortunately worse) sequels; even a TV series was created featuring Alex Murphy, the famous law enforcing human-machine Robocop. So what was so special about \"Robocop\", back then? Well, the short answer should be \"the innovative story\". The film is about a not-so-distant bleak future (today this future unfortunately looks even closer to us...), in which greed and violence prevail, while the private sector takes care of everything, with its focus being in maximizing its profit instead of serving the public (sounds familiar?). In Detroit, OCP company is in charge of running the police (among other activities), but the crime is still rife, with villain Clarence Boddicker (Smith) spreading terror all around. To this end, the number two of OCP Dick Jones (Cox) presents a powerful robot-policeman named ED209, which promises to solve all the city's problems. However, the presentation of ED209 ends in bloodshed and fails miserably, giving the opportunity to a young OCP executive to present his own project, instead: Robocop. Robocop consists of a human policeman Alex Murphy (Weller) who had been killed in action, and has been re-constructed from scratch by the addition of several mechanical parts to his body and the erasure of his memory. The Robocop project proves to be a huge success, as Robocop manages to pacify the city and become a hero to its citizens. However, there are two problems: The first is that Robocop still has memories of his human past which haunt him; these memories become more intense when his former partner, officer Anne Lewis (Allen), realizes who he is, and she explains the missing gaps to him. The second and far more serious problem is that Jones is not happy at all with the turn of events, and so he is ruthlessly determined to destroy both the Robocop project and its creator. Today the above story might not raise so many eyebrows, but back then, it was a really innovative and exciting script. Verhoeven did a superb direction, with many cool (for 1987 standards) visual effects also stealing the show. However, the film still had a few shortcomings: The acting was just average, while the plot still had room for some more twists and a little less predictability. Nevertheless, the result was good, and despite the film's evident age today, its still gets easily a 7/10."

"SINCE I mentioned 'RoboCop' yesterday in my review of 'Total Recall', I'll delve a bit deeper into it today. As I mentioned before, director Verhoeven expresses his concerns about the power of corporations in this flick, but his main concern is about the robot's ability to regain his humanity. Viewers will know that the cop, Murphy, was killed by white gangsters and then outfitted with a robot's mind and body. However, he begins to have dreams about his past life with his family and these lead him to the realization that he was human. His humanity then bursts through the metal and wires to grab control of his mind, and in the final showdown with the corporate baddies, he knocks them off with ease and maintains his demeanor. In a sidebar, the gangster who conducts the most nefarious killings is a white guy, who is a puppet to the white head honcho. In two popular films in the 1980s, 'Witness' and 'Ghost', the head honchos were whites but the baddies who did the killings were minorities. So, it was a pleasant surprise to see a white baddie doing most of the killings in 'RoboCop'." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, Miguel Ferrer, Kurtwood Smith, Ronny Cox and Dan O'Herlihy star in this 1987 sci-fi/action film. This takes place in Detroit, Michigan where we meet cop, Alex Murphy (Weller) who's just transferred from another department. He meets new partner, Anne Lewis (Allen) and he's killed after they attempt to arrest a vicious gang led by Clarence Boddicker (Smith). Soon, Murphy becomes a cyborg, Robocop ran by company, OCP (Omni Consumer Products) headed by vice president, Bob Morton (Ferrer). Robocop starts getting flashbacks of his family and the gang that killed him. He seeks revenge and goes after Clarence's gang members saving him for last. Meanwhile, Dick Jones (Cox) is a corrupt executive at OCP who hates Bob and has him killed by Clarence. Jones also has a lethal machine, ED 209 that fails at first, but is fixed after. Robocop learns that Clarence is working for Jones and tries arresting Jones, but has to get past ED 209 first. Lewis eventually learns that Robocop is her deceased partner, Murphy and helps him get Clarence and Jones. The late, O'Herlihy (Halloween III: Season of the Witch) plays the old man in charge of OCP. I've always liked this film, Weller & the cast are great as well as Basil Poledouris' score. This is an 80's classic I recommend." "As far as a cop would go sure a robot with the common sense and logical capacity of a human would be handy, especially given the assumed strength and durability of the robot bits. But in the world of superheroes or truly dangerous and formidable foes Robocop sorta just sucks. I mean really over the three films he caps around 25 bad guys and gets absolutely demolished and in need of major repair in every. Single. Film. His major 'skill' is the ability to shoot relatively straight and to deliberately ricochet bullets at certain angles. So trick shots is his superpower basically. Yet if you have the equivalent of an Atari 2600 or similar you could probably hack in and alter his programming so that he might target the weak and innocent, or his own colleagues. I'm pretty sure he'd short circuit if he passed a microwave, and I'd guess he'd be f*cked if he got tasered. All in all quite a sucky hero really. But all that said they ended up making three of these things. And here they are, so without further ado Once upon a time, in a world gone to sh*t Future Detroit is a mess, crime is rampant, poverty everywhere and the privately run police force either outmatched or as crooked as those it should be chasing. The most formidable bad guy out there is Clarence Bodicker, a ruthless killer who reigns supreme over a rag tag bunch or similarly slack-moraled minions. Unfortunately for Murphy (Peter Weller) his first day after being transferred to the most dangerous station in Detroit see him cross paths with Bodicker's bunch and turned into something resembling a rissole in front of his partner Lewis (Nancy Allen). The next day Murphy's still twitching corpse is reanimated and finds integrated into various metal parts that form the chassis of the guy on the poster: Robocop. Robocop is a crime fighting cyborg programmed to uphold the law and unleashed upon a city in dire need of serving and protecting. The early stages of his duty are  as Borat would say  'great success', but after a few days and a few bullets to the head Robo-Murphy starts experiencing glitches, flashbacks, memories things that a robotic being shouldn't have. After a few unfortunate occurrences the human police force turns against ol' Roby and call a strike which leads to even more chaos and disorder than a Sunday morning at the Charlie Sheen household. Can Robocop save the day and differentiate between Murphy and its Cyborg self? You'll have to watch to find out. Robocop hasn't aged well, but it does have a few noteworthy elements. There are frequent clever 'future' ads shown through the film that are filled with very black humour, and some other moments that show how the lust for new technology isn't always for the benefit of society. While exceedingly violent the on screen action features more splatter than gore, meaning although many die in a hail of blood and bullets it really isn't too realistic and upsetting. If anything the more guys that get mown down the more 'meh' it all becomes. The design of Robocop is actually very impressive and he gets to coin a few catchphrases of his own while upholding the law in his own carefully programmed way, even if in reality the question might be asked 'what use is a robot-cop that can still be taken down by gunfire anyway?\" Final Rating  6.5 / 10. Hardly an 80s action landmark when compared to Predator or Die Hard, Robocop was nonetheless a worthwhile film that has dated badly and been superseded by the ultra-violence that it satirised." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Paul Verhoven seems to be an intense guy. I would love to see him direct his version of a Nora Ephron-type romantic comedy. But until then, we need to satisfy ourselves with the world he has created, one of giant bugs and cyborgs and lesbian serial killers and hollow men and Kuatos bursting from a guy's chest, and three-breasted women, and \"Saved By The Bell\" cast member's grinding into Agent Cooper like they're having a fit. Verhoven is an extreme in a world of half measures. Here, he takes what should probably been a simple B movie about a killed cop being made into a half man/half cyborg law enforcement officer and cranks it up (I almost said \"Cranks it to 11\" but I think that has finally stopped being clever for writers to use). He takes the premise and adds a Jesus metaphor to it, and also films the violence so splatterly that the camera must have always had a plastic tarp on it. Peter Weller does wonders wearing a costume that looks like it hurt to wear (it did). He manages to take an unrealistic character and make him very human, so that we are shocked how involved we get in his dilemma of not being a dead man, but not being a live robot either. All Robocop knows is he needs revenge against the gang that (sorta kinda) killed him. Much gore and blood ensue. I have read that this is a satire ofwhat exactly I don't know. Corporate greed, I suppose. If anything, I think it satirizes the conventions of a Charles Bronsan action revenge thriller (while embracing the clichés necessary). I'm not sure Verhoven could even tell you.

Shearer pursued Clarence and the team into an abandoned ware house. Clarence managed to ambush officer shearer and than proceeded to empty his load all over shearers torso along with his fella comrades in crime before finally releasing his final load in shearers face. Clarence knew he did wrong and he was now on the run big time. Mean while doctors and nurses had managed to clean officer shearer up and give him a make over and shearer also managed to have his name and identity changed to spare he from the humiliation he suffered that frightful day. Shearer had now become Robo Cop a new masculine macho name to make him feel like a real man again. But he was now bitter and angry and was after Clarence. Clarence knew this and after a crime spree with rocket launchers and machine guns robot cop manged to finally have it out with Clarence one on one,man to man in a flour factory, obviously Clarence didn't come off to well in this fight, he got thrown through quite a lot of glass panes and was forced to grass up his own mate. Clarence was now a Bertie smalls his career that he worked so hard for was in ruins all because of a nosey copper. Any way Clarence skipped bail and manged to lure robot cop into a scrap yard, here they proceeded to fight it out to the death and unfortunately Clarence took a sneaky stab from robocop to the throat. Clarence died and so did a piece of my heart,the local bad boy done good was butchered by a cop in cold blood. Any way robocop went on to murder his boss by throwing him out the window and is now probably standing trial for double homicide.THE END. Bloody good film how this never won an Oscar for best script i will never know." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "One of the better films from the action packed 80's. Verhoeven's graphic and violent movie of a crime ridden, futuristic Detroit has our cyborg hero pitted against a ruthless crime boss who wants to control the city; and an even more ruthless corporation (OCP) which owns and runs the police department. The film is well paced and entertaining, and uses dark humour and irony to good effect. Definite highlight is the action sequence in the cocaine warehouse. Special effects are also impressive. Watch for ED 209. Still a fan of the unstoppable, I loved watching Robocop strut his stuff. Wednesday, May 20, 1992 - Video Verhoeven's violent, near future vision of Detroit works well as an action film even on return viewing. The action sequences are very well put together (the highlight), and special effects are convincing indeed. Mr. Verhoeven's graphic style, which spoilt \"Basic Instinct\", suits this film down to the ground. The movie's narrative keeps you interested, and if you like unstoppable cops, then this film is for you. Saturday, September 19, 1992 - Video" "Before I saw this movie, I saw at least one of the sequels and maybe both. Whatever I have seen, one detail stood out in my mind: the humanity and caring nature of 'Robocop', who was remembering his life as a human. So I figured I could enjoy this movie. Of course, it was too violent for my taste, but I did have several favorable impressions. In this movie, the cop whose brain was used for 'Robocop' kept the memories that made him 'human', though his past did not make a strong impression at first. ED-2000 was a pleasure to watch (except when its actions resulted in violence) because of the primitive but well-done animation, which was obviously animation. I didn't think I would like Kurtwood Smith as a genuinely bad person, but he was deliciously evil and a real treat to watch. His talent for comedy came through here. But I prefer it when he is just being cruel to teenagers who, deep down, he really cares about." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "You may be thinking how can this guy like robocop better than terminator.MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD well I first saw this movie when I was 7 and it was the most violent and most action filled movie I had ever seen.the film has everything action, comedy and even drama.my favourite scene is when ED-209 kills Kinney, It is funny and gruesome ( Only Paul Verhoeven and the monty python cast can do that IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE, SEE IT NOW!!!!!! 10/10" "Without doubt, one of the best 'boy' action movies of all time. The graphic violence and lame cliches make this movie (set in the 'near future') somewhat predictable, but the quality of the action puts it into an exclusive league. This movie doesn't have any pretentious views on the world, it just makes fun of everyone. If you enjoyed Die Hard and The Terminator, I suggest you watch this movie. If Remains of the Day is more your style - avoid. Best line (From the drunk at the Police Station): \"I'm what you call a repeat offender. I repeat, I will offend again.\" Best Concept: The commercials used to intro the news breaks - I want a copy of 'Nukem' for Christmas!" "Jorgie, what are you thinking? How is the Terminator a wannabe, yet it was released 3 years before? Wow. Anyway, this movie is pretty good, but all the sequels sucked. I'd certainly still take the Terminator over Robocop any day, but if you're not in the mood to watch Terminator, get T2:Judgement Day."

"I would have to say, RoboCop is the most violent movie of all-time. The violence of other Sci-Fi and Action films were no match for this one, the scene where Peter Weller's character Murphy gets killed slowly is the most unbearable scene for me. I could accept violent deaths like Impaling, Decapitation and other causes of death as long as it's quick and it's the bad guy who's dying. But there's nothing compared to this especially when I lately discovered in the internet that there was a symbolism of Christ's crucifixion in Murphy's death scene. And I would have nightmares on that death scene dreaming that it was me getting shot and killed slowly, anyway the plot is dark and has black humor on it. The movie is an instant classic becoming the most violent film ever made, so violent that there was one true story in my home country where a 9 year old boy was watching this film but his maid wants to watch a TV show which made the kid angry ending up shooting her. RoboCop 2 was a dud but RoboCop 3 did a good job finishing the trilogy despite making it a PG-13 rating (which I really did appreciate too) and Peter Weller's departure for the title role. In closing what I have shared to you in my movie review and the true story that I've told all I could say is...\"Stay out of trouble.\"" "People get killed so horribly in this movie that it's nothing short of hilarious. Except Murphy, of course. That scene is just sadistic and a little upsetting to be honest. It's even worse uncut, trust me. But when you have Red \"You Dumbass!\" Foreman as a brutal thug/killer, you know you can't go wrong. In fact, I'd put him up on a top twenty list of screen villains, he's that much of a bastard. This movie is violent. Did I mention that? Whether or not you've seen this, try to get your hands on the uncut version if you can. It's among the more brutal examples of cinema expression I can think of. The scene where ED-209 goes berserk and kills an OCP exec is extended and it's not like if he wasn't shot enough in the theatrical version. No, here they shoot him to the point that you start looking at your watch in disbelief. Verhoeven is one wacked-out Dutchman! I'm surprised he didn't play Goldmember come to think of it. Let the shoosting begin!!! This is a great comic-book style movie and I think fans of the genre know better than to let this one go by unnoticed. Rating **** out of *****." "This is a better film than you will remember. As a writer, I know how hard it is to end a really good piece, and as a film student, I'm coming to understand the pressures that a film producer is likely to place on talent. As such, I can forgive the film for my one beef, which is that the ending somewhat tempers the film. Robocop is an impressive, important piece of science-fiction satire, dealing with the definition of humanity on one level, but also, as the plot turns about, taking on deeper and more Shakespearian themes of ruthless self-advancement, dark times, mixed morality, and, in the form of Robocop's Prime Directives, absolute honor. (Those who would protest Verhoeven's level of violence I'd ask to attend an opera.) After a wonderful plot was set up, right up to the third act, however, a far too light and simple ending was presented. It seemed almost as if the film ran out of time and had to rush a wrap-up through production. In the process, Robocop and his lovely, mad world got short changed. Fortunately, it was not enough to kill a really great film. This is a true classic, and not to be missed." "One OF The Best Science Fiction Movies Ever.Non Stop Action And Gore.Peter Weller Plays Well As Robocop And Kurtwood Smith And Ronny Cox play well as the villains. The Story is Peter Weller Gets Bumped off by a gang of killers and is transformed into Robocop. watch out creeps your going to be done. Jack Foreman" "'Robocop' never seems to get much of the praise of other big budget (or even medium budget) sci-fi/action films of the 1980s and early 1990s. Terminator, Blade Runner, Videodrome, and the like are frequently raised as examples of both visual quality and politically grounded narratives. But why has Robocop generally ceded to the background? It may be less visually adept as some of its predecessors (and the stop-action animation may even have been nearing obsoleting), but the film itself appears to be a bleak allegory of America--one inundated with a habitually violent and consumerist culture, and forewarns of the privatization of public services as well as the unpleasant battle of Man and his increasingly sophisticated technological artifacts. The film takes place in Old Detroit, a run down city with a serious crime problem. So much so that the regular police force seems ill-equipped to manage it. And, this spread of uncontrollable violence appears to be an epidemic (listen to the lady who said she was going somewhere on vacation, but the place was in the middle of an invasion). Their desperation for a silver lining comes in the form of robotic cops that a technology company, seeking to introduce their designs into the police department of Old Detroit and eventually gain military contracts thereafter. But, within the company, two high level executive rivals compete with one another, although the design of Robocop obviously wins out over the Star Wars looking prop. So, throw your civil rights out the window, there's a new sheriff in town. But, Robocop of course has been programmed by man is susceptible to the control of the rivaling executives and that is to the benefit of one who is in cahoots with a notorious gang." "Pretty good yarn about a cop in the future who's left for dead by some bad guys. He's resurrected by technology and becomes Robocop, a mixture of technology and humanity. His one-time partner, played by Nancy Allen, eventually recognizes him (he has a rather distinctive jaw) and, after he's hurt rather badly again, she nurses him back to health. I found it pretty entertaining and I think Nancy Allen is incredibly cute. So I was probably predisposed to like this." "Considering it was 1987, there was a lot of stuff, most of it gory, that would have been censored in most other movies with similar scenes. You can often tell in other movies that they do things as to lower the rating like not showing certain things. NOT HERE. If they wanted to show you something, you saw it. That was what really made me like the movie compared to other movies this type." "In the near future, the city of Detroit is overrun by a corporation called \"OCP\" (Omni Consumer Products) whom also run the local police station. The city has too much crime and corruption going on especially cop-killers, the corporation decides to make a special program for the police with a new kind of special technology for them. Newcomer officer Alex J. Murphy (Peter Weller) with his partner Ann Lewis (Nancy Allen) pursue a vicious gang of cop-killing criminals led by Clerence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith), but during an attempted arrest Boddicker and his crew mutilates Murphy to pieces. Luckily the OCP is working on a special cybernetic cop program as they use Murphy's former dead corpse for their Frankenstein-esquire experiment that makes him into a technologically advanced cyborg with special bulletproof and bomb-proof metal and a need to protect the innocent and stop evil. He becomes a sensation towards the public, the media and even the other police officers but underneath that fancy armor memories of his past suddenly trigger especially of his execution as he seeks revenge on those that murdered him. OCP co-chairman Dick Jones (Ronny Cox) along with Boddicker join forces together as they come up with a plan to eliminate Robocop. A brutally violent, stylish and highly energized yet entertaining Sci-fi action epic that is Paul Verhoeven's masterpiece. This became the director's U.S. debut movie and is a perfect mix of action, sci-fi and dark comedy thrown into it with some social satire that has made this a critically acclaimed and very popular movie. The violence and gore especially the infamous death of Murphy is so over the top that it nearly got an X rating but was cut down to get an R rating into theaters, the film co-stars Miguel Ferrer and Daniel O'Herihy. The acting is quite good, the music score by Basil Poledouris is superb and the make-up effects and Robocop effects by Rob Bottin and Phil Tippet are out of this world, it's an unforgettable movie that is one of Sci-fi's greatest motion pictures.

"Good science-fiction films are hard to come by. Films set in a bleak future are not. And yet Robocop effectively combines those two sub-genres and ends up being what is quoted to be \"the best science-fiction film since Metropolis.\" Although I haven't seen Metropolis, I know that Robocop is not the greatest science-fiction film in the last 50 years. Merely, it is a mediocre film, with cliché characters, a confusing plot with generic evil corporate bosses with basic names...the list goes on and on. What saves Robocop is just that-Robocop. He's probably the coolest fictional character ever created (well, either him or Grimace from McDonald's). Either way, it's the pure cool factor of Robocop that puts the movie from mediocrity to something to be remembered. Police officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is brutally shot to death by thugs in a not-to-distant future Detroit, where a company's going to provide the police force with robots for cops. The prototype that's brought out screws up, so they decide to make Murphy into the title character. He's now Robocop, a cop that kicks ass and takes names, but has memories of his demise still lodged into his head. He decides to go out for revenge, as the company tries to kill him so they can put their robot on the market. As I said before, the action's just mediocre. There's some shooting and everything, but done generically. The best part isn't the action, thankfully. It's when there's stuff happening outside the action with Robocop. When he goes out to stop crime. He stops a rape by shooting a man in the genitals, which basically goes THROUGH the woman's dress. No human could do that, only the epitome of cool could: Robocop. And Weller does a great job as the stone-faced cop, with just the little bit of emotion. Nancy Allen is the token hard-assed female on the force, who acts like she's in an 80's movie, so I guess that's OK. The film as a whole is never boring-Paul Verhoeven keeps everything rolling for it's short-but-sweet runtime, and I liked all of the pre-Starship Troopers attacks on America-\"Get them before they get you!\" I also liked what Verhoeven did with portraying Robocop as a modern day Jesus-it worked effectively. So the movie works for the most part-any time where Robocop is on the screen. If you can get past the generic feel of the rest of the movie, and just watch for Robocop, you'll love it. My rating: 7/10 Rated R for strong violence and language." "In Detroit of the \"near future\" crime is getting out of hand and the police are being killed left and right. A corporation (OCP) is hired to develop machines that would replace police. Officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is viciously killed in the line of duty. He is brought back to life as Robocop--half machine and half man with no memory of his human life. But then he starts to remember and goes after the people who killed him. Director Paul Verhoeven's blockbuster hit of 1987 isn't really all that good. It does have good things about it--there's some very funny but pitch black humor; parodies of TV commercials and news; great stop motion animation; plenty of blood and violence and LOTS of shootouts. That's the main problem--this movie is TOO loud and seems more interested in violence than in a coherent plot (there are loopholes galore). There has to be at least 5 huge gunfights here which just go on forever. Also the violence gets far too graphic--Weller's torture and killing just goes way overboard. The acting doesn't matter too much--violence is all this movie has to offer. Weller is OK, Allen is terrible but Ronny Cox and Kurtwood Smith have a lot of fun in their roles. A lot of people like this for the virtual nonstop action and violence but it tired me down after a while and the one interesting aspect of the plot (Murphy remembering his life as a human) isn't given enough time to really develop. Also the plot loopholes get increasingly noticeable after a while...for instance, how did Cox get that directive #4 installed in Robocop's system when he had nothing to do with its creation? It's mentioned that OCP is under some corporation--what corporation? Still, if you're looking for mindless blood, violence and destruction this IS your movie. Great ending too. I give it a 7. Also take a VERY close look at the statement after the closing credits--there's a funny little line snuck in there."

"*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Robocop is an amazing movie! Alex J. Murphy/Robocop(Peter Weller) is killed by notorious criminals and he is later reconstructed as Robocop. The movie is extremely gory and is very well made. It has a great story for an action movie. It is cool to see Robocop slowly regain some of his humanity and memories which leads to him taking revenge. The music score is fantastic and really feels right for the movie. The look of Robocop is very original. The special effect hold up very well. It also has some of the best movie lines ever. Robocop is an action movie hero that is one of a kind. Robocop is a movie that deserves to be called a classic. It's over the top, well made, and a perfect movie." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Robocop is one of those films where you have to have the right mindset when watching it, if you're expecting this to be an amazing movie then you'll be surely disappointed but if you're expecting fun, well then it delivers. Robocop tells the story of Alex Murphy who's a cop, in the first twenty or so minutes of the movie he gets shot and killed, in what is a pretty violent death. Eventually Alex get's reborn again but not as a human but instead as a cyborg to help keep crime off the city streets, this is basically the whole plot to the movie. It's a movie that has a simple plot with little to no character development but yet you can't help but love it. As I said earlier the story in the film is simple, but that doesn't mean its bad. Robocop may not have a good story but it does work for what it is, Robocop mainly skips on the story though and just delivers action and blood which for a movie like this, I'm not going to complain. Robocop does get cheesy at times but that's what makes this fun, it has a lot of one liners and quotable lines. The acting in the film is pretty solid, I can't really complain about them seeing how the movie is from the 80's and some of the action is expected to come off as cheesy. All the actors make best with what they have to work with. I think Robocop is just one of those movies you should have fun with and not try picking apart, it does get cheesy at times but it's a movie from the 80's so its almost expected. If you want a movie that's fun, has lots of blood, and explosions then you'll enjoy this." "I just got done watching Robocop and i have to admit it kept me interested the whole time. The blood splattering in this movie was top notch. Robocop (Murphy) seems to me to be a more friendly terminator and without an Austrian accent. I wouldn't say this movie is for everyone. I have always enjoyed an old school action movie so its not a far stretch for me to be entertained by this movie. I will definitely be watching this again.No doubt in my mind! But just for people with weak stomachs...if your not ready for exploding body parts then stay away from my boy Robocop! In this day and age Detroit needs robocop to clean up the streets. Sincerely, Beast from the southeast" "I saw Robocop when it was theatrically released in 1997 (I was then 20 years old), and while I loved it, I was as conflicted about it then as I am now. Which is to say that I was very, very conflicted. Robocop is a reprehensible piece of work and it's also one of my favorite movies. The tension between loathing and adoration is probably what makes it memorable to me, more than the film's admittedly striking visual and intellectual content. Basically, Robocop is an ultra-vicious splatter movie dressed up as a dystopian science-fiction satire. It presents a relentlessly bleak, thuggish and superficial future world where capital controls society to such an extent as to resemble a form of economic fascism. The plot centers on the struggle between what remains of Murphy, a murdered police officer, part of whose brain has been used as material in the construction of the titular law-enforcement robot, and OCP, the giant, shadowy mega-corporation that has privatized the police department. Paul Verhoeven (The 4th Man, Starship Troopers) directs from a script by Michael Miner and Edward Neumeier (Starship Troopers) with his customary technical skill and taste for brutally black comedy. In many ways Robobop is Verhoeven's ultimate statement on the toxic wasteland of American culture, his primary theme since abandoning his native Netherlands. He presents the viewer with a vision of a violent, stupid, media-saturated society, and berates viewers for their complicity with that society. This would not be so terribly unique a position take, but for one brilliant stroke on Verhoeven's part: he makes movies that present themselves, too, as extensions of the society he criticizes. Which is to say that all of his American movies have been explicitly `American movies' - autocritical devices that function as examples of that on which they purport to comment. They are cold, stupid, brutal affairs that express nothing so clearly as their loathing for any audience that might enjoy them. At the same time, they subtly or explicitly subvert their superficial grotesquerie by commenting on the social milieu in which they take place. Thus both Robocop and Starship Troopers not only resemble bad American television shows, they explicitly present themselves as bad American television shows, complete with advertisements and vacuous `news briefs.' Robocop is especially ruthless with regard to its audience, subjecting viewers to a dizzying, non-stop assault of violent spectacle. It veers back and forth between amusingly arch comic-book violence and nauseatingly graphic brutality, pulling the audience in with the comfortable spectacle of well-executed action movie derring-do, and then punishing viewers for enjoying it by subjecting them to incredibly drawn-out and grisly scenes of torture and mutilation. On one level, Robocop obviously wants to comment on and criticize the senseless, inconsequential brutality of American action cinema, but to that end it luxuriates in it's critic's license by hyperextending it's own representations of violence to previously unimaginable extremes. Sitting through Robocop for the first time (especially, I imagine, in it's new, vastly bloodier \"director's cut\" edition) is a profoundly disturbing and desensitizing experience. This is not necessarily a problem. Much of the 20th century's greatest art is profoundly disturbing, and Robocop never allows its violence to function as simpleminded \"thrills\". It humanizes the violence it seems to celebrate, reminding the audience at every turn that pain and terror are integrally linked to \"action.\" To complicate matters, however, it intentionally undercuts it's own critique, constantly letting the audience off the hook by supplying a horrific joke or a swashbuckling uplift to deflate our revulsion when the horror becomes too much to bear. Robocop wants to have it's cake and eat it too, criticizing the conventions of American action movies as an emblem of the vacant blackness at the center of the American soul, but also reveling in the undeniable joys of the action movie format for the sake of turning a buck at the box office. This is certainly a valid approach, and Verhoeven may be congratulated for eschewing a puritan didacticism in his critique. But as with Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers, one is left with the suspicion that for all the intellectual dazzle and political posturing, there is something horribly manipulative and heartless about the sensibility at work behind the film. That the movie is not fundamentally the autocritical device it purports to be, but merely a nihilistic bellow of rage and disgust, a self-important tirade against an audience for which the filmmaker feels nothing but contempt. Even worse, I worry that deep down Robocop (like NBK) is nothing but cynical moneymaking ploy, dressed up in the sheep's clothing of subversive intent to blunt the edge of critical assault. You can't really bring yourself to fault Robocop for it's cynicism, ugliness, and cruelty, after all, because it pretends to be merely holding a mirror up to our American soul. And who could fault so noble an intent, even as we watch Verhoeven walk away, laughing, hand in hand with Joe Eszterhas (author of Verhoeven's Basic Instinct and Showgirls) and great big bag of nice, green money." "This movie isn't exactly the most unique of it's kind, although it does have some original aspects. However, Robocop does entertain on many different levels. Firstly, the action in this movie is very enjoyable and is nothing too over-the-top, although some people may argue me on that, and yes is does push censors for an R-rated, non horror movie to be this gruesome at times. The story in this movie is also something more than you're classic shoot-em' up cops and robbers movie, it adds an element of philosophy in the ideas of humanity and poses the question of where does one draw the line between robot and human? Not only is this a question posed, but it is a reoccurring issue throughout. Another angle this movie takes on is the idea of man's desire for control over man by a newer means; technology. Extending from this is the idea of how much control man has over machine (an element we've seen in so many movies before, and after) and can a machine actually perform the functions of a human being with the obvious lack of emotionable ability. Throw in some quality acting, great directing, a cool cyborg, another cool robot with big guns, more big guns and a wickedly evil Red Foreman and you've got a movie that shimmers the light of hope in a dismal future and a Hollywood classic." "I first saw this movie years ago and didn't remember it too well so I saw it again recently and I thought the movie was really horrid. Most of the violence to me is very bad. Very was little of it was necasasary. The guy getting hit by the car after being in a bunch of toxic chemicals had no point except to show something gross. The idea of this movie is nice and shows a great view of the world in the future. Otherwise I think this movie is overrated. 3/10" "ROBOCOP (1987) ***1/2 Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, Ronny Cox, Kurtwood Smith, Dan O' Herlihy. Sci-fi actioner from director Paul Verhoeven paints a nifty portrait of the future set for a world of violence, corporate take overs and lastly a gang of murderous thugs who kill a Detroit policeman and used as the force's special projects group pet project of assembling a law enforcement cyborg (Weller in a humdinger of a role) to serve and protect the public good. Sly satire with a dash of comic book non-chalant gore makes a diverting entertaining flick. Best line: after baddie Smith disables human-for-the-moment Weller the fallen officer retorts \"Buddy... I think you're slime!\"" "An entertaining movie with plenty of action and gratuitous breasts (bar scene) but something interesting caught my attention: A possible low key slam at Pontiac by Ford via the writers? Here is my logic: The OCP officers drove futuristic Ford Taurus police cars, correct? Normally car manufacturers provide cars to movie makers for advertising purposes, though I didn't see an acknowledgment in the credits. Thus the potential for sponsor influence. I know, without the acknowledgment it is a bit of a stretch, but bear with me. There were numerous references to the \"6000SUX\" gas guzzling car, including the cute commercial by the CHIODO Bros. What relevance is this? The number 6000. Robocop was released in 1987. The Ford Taurus hit the streets in 1986 and it's main competitor was Pontiac's \"6000.\" 6000 SUX... 6000 sucks? Subliminal suggestion? Are the writers that clever? Food for thought, but funny if true..." "I don't mind violence...but the Robocop Director's Cut is mind boggling. Murphy's death is violent enough in the released version. In the X, it is very disturbing. It made me want to jump into the screen and punish those guys in the most horrific ways just to let them know how FUBAR they really were. For die-hard Robo fans, do not waste the $35-$40 it costs just to be grossed out. The R-rated version is fine just the way it is. It is also so bad, that after Kurtwood Smith and Ray Wise (Clarence and Leon) saw the screening, they said that they pleaded with Paul Verhoeven to tone it down since they didn't want to be forever linked as the psycho killers in Robocop. It took awhile; but luckily for their career sakes they have gone on to do other stand-out performances that sometimes for the regular film-TV viewer, they don't automatically associate them as the former." "You know I was only 2 years old when this movie was released and my parents said they actually let me watch it when I was 4 years old when it was released? My sister always teased them about how they wouldn't let me watch other movies with little violence or just a little nudity, but they'd let me watch Robocop? Well, they took it to heart, I never saw Robocop again, figuring now that I'm 21, maybe I have a right to see it on my own and may I say that this was a true action flick and a definite cliché of all action movies of the 80's, gotta love them. Murphy is a cop, but when he goes to bust a drug and weapon scandal going on, he gets brutally shot that automatically kills him, but OCP, the police organization he works for have been looking for a cop that doesn't rest or can be killed while being on the job, they take Murphy's body and turn him into Robocop! A machine that acts like a cop and performs the duties of one, but he starts to go haywire when he has flashbacks of Murphy's memories and there may be a traitor in the police force! While Robocop is one of the most unrealistic movies you will ever see in your life, it was all in good fun. I have to say that I have never heard a more useless way of the F Word like I did in Robocop, but that was so funny! Not to mention I loved the death out the window! It's not a true 80's action flick without a death out the window. If you are looking for a movie to take seriously, don't watch it, but for good fun, just please get the popcorn and have a good time! 7/10" "Add another review" "Find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your Watchlist and rate your favorite movies and TV shows on your phone or tablet!")("Movies, TV & Showtimes" "Celebs, Events & Photos" "News & Community" "Watchlist" "" "Find industry contacts & talent representation" "Manage your photos, credits, & more" "Showcase yourself on IMDb & Amazon" "Sign in with Facebook Other Sign in options" "Own the rights?" "It's a shame that this movie wasn't done better because there's a lot of potential because the story is great. But unfortunately this movie was done in the 1980's which means you're stuck with cheesy, over-the-top acting, mediocre effects (though I'm sure they were at least typical when the film was made), and the same crappy directing that plagued so many films in the era. I think there's a lot of potential to the story and the human element and internal conflict of the RoboCop/Murphy character but the film largely skims right past most of that focusing more on needless side clips of a setting that was never established or non-critical villains. I'm interested to see the reboot version and hoping they go the direction so many other films in this generation of action movies have gone... dark, realistic, and gritty. If you gave this concept to Christopher Nolan, you'd have an amazing movie. Hopefully the reboot can be everything the original wasn't. Now it sounds like I'm being really hard on the movie and yet I gave it a 7/10 so what gives? Well, it was still a good movie, even with all the minor negatives, because the story has so much potential and even with the poor execution it manages to pull you in." "\"RoboCop\" has not aged gracefully. The action sequences seem stagey and flat in this post-\"Matrix\" age, and the clay animated ED209 now looks more like a \"Wallace & Gromit\" villain than a fearsome metallic menace. The violence is indulgent and over-the-top, the women all have silly '80s hair, and the main villain is the Dad from \"That '70s Show.\" The whiskers on this movie are about a mile long. Aside from that, though, it's pretty good. Ronny Cox is an engaging bad guy, often picking up the slack when the rest of the movie is falling down around him, and his final defeat is one of the cleverest gimmicks I've ever seen in a movie. The social satire is entertaining, but ultimately quite predictable; don't all sci-fi movies predict that marketing will become infinitely more obnoxious in the future? I have mixed praise for Robocop himself; he's got personality and he's easy to root for, but why is Murphy so much cooler as a cyborg than as a human? He had to die to acquire a shred of charisma! At the end of the day, this is dated but fun - and it's nowhere near a masterpiece. The Criterion Collection must've released this movie on an off day, when they couldn't get the rights to something better." "I will admit I would have probably given this film a couple more stars back in the day. It was popular because it was different. A new, somewhat original concept is always embraced excitedly. But our attention to detail and critical eyes have evolved since the eighties. There's no chance this movie could survive with such high ratings if it had been a new release in this generation of film. Even if it'd been lavishly souped with our great special effects of the day. The utter absurdity that was the violence in this film is laughable. People shot so heavily and so continuously and still they live? Even if they die, they die so dramatically it's ridiculous. I finally had to completely suspend all belief to finish this film, and simply embrace it's whole-hearted science-fictional ways. 'Okay, so this is a world where people don't die like real people do. Cool. There are robots running around. I can handle it.' Still, after making such an adjustment, it failed, sadly, to make the movie good. They spent all their time developing the effects and less time with the story and characters. That's not to say they did NO work. I liked the female lead. She was cool. But there wasn't enough of her. Robo was cool, too. But I could have used a little more of developing the male lead and a little less of the pointless time spent developing the robot. The rest of this fantasy world was just hopped up on a whole lot of crazy and I couldn't care one hill of beans about how it turned out. I knew how it was going to end, but the process of getting me there left me seriously wanting. I gave it three stars because I thoroughly enjoyed seeing my surly 'That '70s Show' father, Kurtwood Smith, playing a bad guy." "The first movie of the popular \"RoboCop\" series is considered to be the best of them and a masterpiece of science fiction. While it is really original and has strong message, it is too gory (and I say this being a horror-fan), chaotic and unpleasant to watch. The main character, RoboCop is very interesting and the villain is really ghastly and memorable, but the bad robot looks very stupid and the film is full with scenes of sadistic violence, which made it tough to watch. Unlike the sequels, the first RoboCop is considered to be a \"serious scifi\", but it's neither good nor as enjoyable as the best movie in the cyborg genre - The Terminator." "i was just wondering if RoboCop ever felt sexual longing for women. anyone care to respond? if there is a part where he displays (i'll even allow references from the less-enjoyable sequels) such a characteristic, tell me where it is, because i certainly missed it. another funny thing i noticed is that the actor who plays Joe Cox is named Jesse Goins. add an 'r' after the 'G' and what does it spell? i thought that was humorous." "A surprisingly nasty and off-putting action film from 1987. \"RoboCop\" is set in a near future where corporations are creating robotic sentinels to help fight rampant crime. One such creation haywires and runs amok. Enter RoboCop, created when a police officer (Peter Weller) is killed in the line of duty and resurrected as a part human/part robotic commando. An intelligent screenplay would have used this set up to explore some moral questions about man vs. machine, or nature vs. mechanization. At the very least it would have explored the psyche of Weller's character a bit more, examining the act of killing from the point of view of someone who's neither completely human nor completely mechanical. But this isn't an intelligent film, so it opts instead to wallow in sadistic and graphic violence. By the end of the film, whole scenes are being set up for the sole purpose of seeing people be flayed, dismembered, immersed in toxic waste and killed in other splatter-porn variations. It's a film that invites you to enjoy it as a bit of escapism and then makes it difficult to have much fun with it. Stephen Flick and John Pospicil received a special achievement Academy Award for their Sound Effects Editing, and the film received two competitive nominations that it did not win: Best Film Editing (Frank J. Urioste) and Best Sound (Michael J. Kohut, Carlos de Larios, Aaron Rochin and Robert Wald). Grade: C-" "I would recomend this movie to people but not all.The reason this movie isn't great is it is very very gory.It also has a lot of drug use and other stuff.But other then those things it is a good action film.I would give this a 6.5 out of ten and recomend it to action fans but be warned it is a gory film." "I guess I'm going to be the outcast here and say this movie was a major disappointment in just about every category. I watched the Criterion version, OOP and therefore expensive, and simply don't get it. What qualifies this to be nominated for Oscars? If this one claims Oscars, then there is simply no award that would do justice to 'The Terminator'. OK, let me not compare this to any other movie. How does it weigh on its own? The dialogue - agonizingly flaky and juvenile. The FX - blasé. The storyline - predictable to the end. The acting - remarkably unremarkable. To its credit, there were about 5 minutes of film that stood apart from the rest. The 'robot demo' at the executive meeting, and Murphy's bloody demise. The savagery in both cases was well captured and made a point. Everything else was script-out-of-a-can, acting-out-of-a-can, plot-out-of-a-can, etc. For e.g., how does Robocop prove its battle-worthiness on the mean streets? By foiling a convenience store holdup and a rape. These 2 scenes were so tired and clichéd - they're standard procedure in just about every cop and robber movie ever made. There's a lot of discussion and appreciation in these forums about the 'humanity' of Robocop. OK, so he forgets his folks, but figures out their/his address from a computer and wanders through his abandoned old house, and is programmatically unable to enforce the law on his creators. I'm sorry, but for me, that's hardly a portrait in humanity. C'mon folks, if you look real hard for something, you'll likely wind up imagining its there. If it had the least shred of humanity, for example, it wouldn't go letting loose its guns for target practice when its partner (who rescued it, btw) is sleeping just a few feet away, dog-tired. The ending was completely predictable and unworthy of any subsequent contemplation. Its hard to not compare this unworthy conclusion to a real one-of-a-kind classic - The Terminator. The conclusion there was nothing but humanity, as best a machine could manifest. It was a conclusion that made me reflect, and feel, and imagine, long after the movie was over. In closing - I am not saying that this was a lousy movie - For it's time (1987) it was OK. I am saying that this is a vastly over-hyped movie that simply does not do justice to the accolades it has gathered. It is as good a movie as Tango and Cash, or Black Rain, or Dirty Harry. There is much better scifi out there - like the Alien series, The Terminator, The Matrix, Donnie Darko, etc., and what the heck - even Disney's Tron. That Criterion picked this to represent a high point of scifi cinematic accomplishment - is simply unfathomable. This gesture is not just a matter of conferring unwarranted and unworthy credit, it is additionally an affront to the real giants of scifi that have carved their names forever in cinema, our hearts, and our consciousness." "When I first saw this almost 20 years ago, I thought it was one of the most violent movies I'd ever seen. It may still be ranked as such, despite 20 more years of violent films. Much of it, at least in the first half of the film, is entertaining but it gets just too carried away with cartoon-like villains and overdone violence. I think what bothered me was that it looked like a film geared to attract kids, even with the R rating and millions of kids did indeed watch this. The villains are so outlandishly bad you almost have to laugh. Ronny Cox has to be one of the best actors and being someone the audience hates and Daniel O'Herlily isn't far behind in that category. Like many other, I like a good crime/science fiction film but this was just too nasty, too hard-edged and needlessly profane. What the movie needs is more humor in place of all the overdone shooting and profanity. It would have made it much better." "Sorry to say that RoboCop just didn't do it for me. If they were trying to be over the top and ridiculous, they failed. The film was kind of slow and to be completely honest, boring. It wasn't too silly, although the humor seemed kind of...blunt. The acting is fine, although some characters only succeed in being annoying. The effects are fine for the 80s, but the action is not very entertaining. I was just underwhelmed. I know that \"The Terminator\" is a very different sort of film, but as far as Cyborgs go, the movie and the character Terminator are a hell of a lot cooler and better. Anyway, enough of my ranting. Maybe I missed something, since many seem to like this film a lot. I personally didn't. 3/10, I would avoid."

"*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "From director Paul Verhoeven (Total Recall, Basic Instinct, Starship Troopers), I remember watching this film a few times when I was younger, but I could only remember certain moments, so in my older days I had to see it again. Basically in the not too distant future in Detroit, the city is ridden with crime, and the police department have been bought out by Omni Consumer Products (OCP), so the staff are going on strike. While Officer Alex J. Murphy (Peter Weller) has been transferred from Metro South to the West and partnered with Officer Anne Lewis (Carrie's Nancy Allen) the large corporate company taking over, run by senior president Dick Jones (Total Recall's Ronny Cox), are trying to find new ways to lower crime rate, and they have developed new robot ED-209 that goes wrong before it can even go into action. While Murphy and Lewis are trying to track down a gang of criminals, led by Clarence J. Boddicker (Dead Poets Society's Kurtwood Smith), the group beat up and shoot Murphy dead. One of the OCP employees makes another law enforcement robot to rival with Jones, with Murphy's corpse he transforms him into and creates RoboCop, a crime fighting machine with three prime directives: serve the public trust, protect the innocent, and uphold the law. For a good amount of time RoboCop proves himself as a worthy force for good and a great machine to clean up crime, with his gun skills, his ability to avoid injury, and his unrelenting attitude, but having the brain Murphy still inside him he is having flashes from his former life as a human. He is seeing flashes from when he was killed, more so after an encounter with one of the criminals, and flashes also include his life with his family, but with what is coming back to him he is finding a way to catch the gang and possibly have the chance to take revenge. Obviously Boddicker realises he is wanted by RoboCop, and Lewis recognised that it was Murphy inside the body of the robotic cop, and when he tries to kill the one bossing the gang, Jones, he discovers a fourth directive he was unaware of, that he cannot arrest or harm people who work at OCP. After a damaging encounter with the villain of the piece Murphy has pretty much completely remembered who he is, and with Lewis they hide out in a place the criminals will be gathering, taking of his mask, and ultimately getting his vengeance by killing them, and especially Boddicker. In the end RoboCop returns to OCP to prove that Jones is a criminal, and it is only after he is \"fired\" by the villain's higher in the company that RoboCop can kill Jones, and he walks away assuring the company he will surely carry on fighting crime. Also starring Miguel Ferrer as Bob Morton, Daniel 'Dan' O'Herlihy as The Old Man, Robert DoQui as Sergeant Warren Reed, Ray Wise as Leon C. Nash, Felton Perry as Johnson and Paul McCrane as Emil M. Antonowsky. The acting is good for all the parts, especially of course the leading star creating a magnificent cyborg police officer with mime like characteristics, the film is full of interesting ideas of how to create a \"perfect\" world, little pointers about the power of promotion and advertising, and niggles on social issues, and of course the sometimes comic violence and special effects really make this a fantastic satirical science-fiction action thriller. It won the Oscar for the Special Achievement Award for sound effects editing, and it was nominated for Best Film Editing and Best Sound, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Make Up Artist and Best Special Effects. Very good!" "'RoboCop' represents a low point in '80s sci-fi cinema. The acting is laughable, the plot redundant, and the dialogue stale. I suppose the film was intended to be brain candy, but its sheer unpleasantness causes it to fail even in this respect. The fun factor is further reduced by the movie's almost unbearably annoying villains who, for whatever reason, find it necessary to giggle with girlish glee whenever they kill or threaten someone. A stupid, pointlessly violent, and thoroughly unenjoyable movie. If you're looking for an enjoyable cyborg flick, this ain't it. Try 'The Terminator' or 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day' instead." "Leaving aside the sophomoric \"satire\" that seems for some unfathomable reason to have impressed far too many people, ROBOCOP is just a big, dumb, overblown action flick. This would have been a perfect vehicle for Steven Seagal (who pretty much acts like a robot anyway) if it had been made a year or two later. On the other hand, my taste and that of the American public do not exactly run parallel, thank God. Statistically speaking, given that everyone else seems to absolutely *love* this piece of garbage, you probably will too. So watch it, if you're impressed by red-colored Karo syrup and exploding stuff. But if you happen to notice that it's continually insulting your intelligence: remember, I'm the one who warned you." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "I saw \"Robocop\" on TV for the first time in 1990,and I actually enjoyed it even tho I was just a teenager.I liked the action and the violence,and Robocop himself looked cooler than everything...so what's not to like about this sci-fi action?First of all,the Verhoeven touch:the Dutch director loves the extreme violence and Robocop doesn't make exception..I actually have no problem with violence in movies,it could be funny as hell and also a sign of style.John Woo in his best Chinese days directed some of the best action movies I've ever seen,and they all had oceans of blood in em.But Verhoeven is different,his representation of violence is pure splatter and gratuitous.You can almost see the smile of his face when he represents the ultra-violent Murphy's execution by Clarence and his men.And then we see brains splattered,eyes ripped off,a guy obliterated by a malfunctioning prototype and so on.So this is the first problem,the over the top,gratuitous violence. The second problem is the crappy stop motion.I don't know why they used a horribly animated ED-209 instead of a real-size thing,but the scenes in which we see it,it looks hilarious. Third thing:not so much and not so good action.Don't get me wrong,Verhoeven is capable of filming some good action-Total Recall over all-,but this movie needed more and better scenes because it has such a cool character. Peter Weller does a good job although we mostly see him with his iron mask on,but it must have been a pain to wear that suit.Good supporting characters and a always great Kurtwood Smith who portrays the ruthless crime lord Clarence Butticker-so brave that he thinks he could go hand to hand with Robocop,and obviously fails with one eye less.The soundtrack is great,nothing to say about it. Last word:Robocop is a good movie,it has a good screenplay and it's entertaining,but leaves a lot to be desired.Cut off the flick all the things I mentioned above and you will have a great action sci-fi drama.If only they gave it to a different director....." "OK, I'm not a fan. But undoubtedly this movie had startling success; which led to a second part, a third part, and a fourth TV one, not to mention a TV series and another TV series but animated! So, why is that ? RoboCop (1987) is original when it comes to accumulate that load of drastic and loud live cartoon action, and in a big production too. Its title character was one of the first icy rigid heroes (as a machine, not like Arnie from the same era) who you love to combine with; to immerse in his violence, live the solidity, and forget all the feelings which make you too weak, fall in love, and have that human yet cruel wounds. It's a perfect way to enjoy the illusion of owning a super distractive ability, blowing up your annoying foes, and serving the society in the same time. So RoboCop, as a movie or a character, managed in the late 1980s to get a special place in the pop-culture and be a noticeable indicator in terms of the direct connection between the violence of reality and the violence of art, whereas the first comes always first, and art is naturally the mirror. Now let me elaborate on why this successful hero and movie aren't successful for me. First off, that literally metallic hero. They gave us a Ropo-Dirty Harry or his inbred development in the sci-fi genre after 15 years of its first appearance. Nevertheless, Inspector Harry is more human and less ridiculous (and you can say that again if replaced Dirty Harry with Darth Vader !). In short, with the way he speaks and moves, Robocop is too silly he's laughable ! As for the movie, I believe that its success had a lot to do with its violence, and the exaggerated representation of it on screen; by the camera's angles, the rough editing, the crack-brained special effects and the very profuse explosions ! This movie loyally imitated the foolish violence of the video games, with doubling it many times. To some extent, RoboCop (1987) did for the action movies what Madonna did for the pop singing; since both of them crowded the materialistically attractive elements; the harsh violence in the action blockbusters, and the sexiness in the modern singing and dancing; to shake up the pop culture, and  yes  win more money, rephrasing the rule from \"Sex Sells\" to \"Abundant Violence and Sex Abundantly Sell\" ! While it pretends to be satirical, the movie is so flat and hollow. Don't wait for a respectful satire about violent toys, inane media, or rotten authority; whether governments or companies. Because any social or political commentary, rather any serious concept; was exterminated by the heavy violence. In fact, the sole substance this movie has is seducing the audience and seizing their money by hectic and bloody fights ! Let alone, how this so-called satire was presented through comic touches; as TV news or commercials (about cheap violent toys !), with repeating them, in rhythmical manner, till the end of the movie.. the very movie which confirmed all the time that it's a real cheap violent toy in itself, having no difference except for its too much violence, extravagance and pretension ! Over and above, that insufferably disturbing spirit all the time. And it doesn't come from the cold mechanical cadence of the title's character only, but from the character of the director as well. He confessed, in a documentary about this movie, that in 1987 he didn't know any English; therefore he handled the work, so everybody, with great nervousness and unbroken outburst, and it's obvious how this infected the crew and the movie. Hence, it's easy to understand the secret of all the hysterical atmosphere and the burning pace.. It's Mr. Paul Verhoeven ladies and gentlemen ! Objectively speaking, RopoCop is some icon in the history of the American culture, which tells you a lot about the Americans themselves in one era. Plus it did leave an effect on the next era (Judge Dredd for little instance). Though, subjectively speaking, RopoCop is one heck of a stupid odious hero, all of what he does is goofy and ludicrous, this movie is sickening delirious nightmare, and whenever I hear its last line \"Call Me Murphy\" I instantly replay \"Sorry, I Call You Jerk\" !" "Boy is this film rubbish. If you want a robots film you will not find one that is worse.It's just a piece of rubbish on the ground. The story is so dumb and it goes on forever before it ends. It's a story about a cop who is shot all over the place but still doesn't die, and then he's turned into a robot. See what I mean? This is such a rubbish story. He goes after the man who killed him and tries to kill him back. This will make you feel so miserable, like coming home to find your house burgled. All the actors look weird and they are too old. The cops in the movie look more like salesmen. The special effects are rubbish which means that when they happen in the movie it makes you point and laugh at how rubbish they are. If they had made more effort to make them look better the film would have been better." "this is what i call unrealistic film. and i hate unrealistic films. behavior of people is unrealistic. it's not bad because of the story, which i like, and i think is possible. if you're kid then this film is probably good because you dont notice lack of realism yet. filmmakers think because science fiction is not real, then they can make also all other stuff in film non-realistic. this is problem with bad science fiction films. good science fiction films are realistic, like Alien and James Cameron films. realism in Alien is for example this: when man with beard goes with flame gun to chase alien. then when he is there he says: \"I don't think this is good idea. I want to get out of here.\" This is really how human psychology works. you can't know how you will feel in certain situation until you are there. 1/10" "Add another review" "Find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your Watchlist and rate your favorite movies and TV shows on your phone or tablet!")

"*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "When I was a kid, the word \"Robocop\" would bring into mind a silly robot policeman who talked funny (thanks Robocop 3). When I grew older,I saw the first \"Robocop\" and all I could say that I was blown away just like Peter Weller's Hand. I never thought that a movie about a very cartoonish-looking character could be so vicious and brutal. Peter Weller's mutilation was disturbing and his revenge as Robocop provide equally stomach-churning tableaux of undiluted nastiness. Aside from the gruesome set pieces, we are also treated to violent gun battles punctuated by bloody arterial sprays from each unlucky victim. But \"Robocop\" does't only exist to show us a human hand being blasted in graphic detail by a shotgun, it also serves as a biting, funny social commentary on how consumerism and capitalism have morally downgraded our society. This is evident in the \"infomercials\" that pop out of the film from time to time, which advertises bizarre and violent entertainment for the enjoyment of the entire family.(like that nuclear war game) what's good is that Verhoeven actually maintains the films unique mood throughout the film. The combination of violent splatter and social commentary is evident when the dumb robot, the ED-209, splatters an executive all over the place. The old man's( Dan O'Herlihy) response? \"Dick, I'm very disappointed.\" Films like this not only entertains us with violent action, it also takes its time to make us laugh as society spirals downward. ROBOCOP FOR TOP 250!!!" "Yes, the guy who did this movie would later make Starship Troopers, here though I think is a more realistic take on a future society. A rather violent society, a place where the average cop just is not enough so they try to make a super cop. First, they try a totally robotic one with very deadly yet somehow darkly comic results. Since this one fails another person gets to try it his way and they make this robotic cop using the remains of an officer who is simply gunned down in a most brutal and unpleasant way. So the officer goes out on his beat and takes out criminals very effectively albeit a bit emotionless. His former partner though jogs his memory and all hell breaks loose at a factory where we have a very cool fight that even involves a dude getting toxic waste on himself. Then you have a conclusion that while not as great as the factory fight is still rather cool and a bit funny as well. So there you have it, Peter Weller does a rather good job as Robocop, Nancy Allen is okay too, but nothing special. Good villains too, but I can not really say if I remember seeing them in other movies other than Ronny Cox as if has been awhile since I have seen this movie. Though as a kid I thought this movie was the bomb as I saw it at the theater. Did not care for the fake commercials in it though." "Usually I don't like thin, action movies. However, RoboCop is far from thin. The plot here is actually quite complex. In the near future, Detroit is a city packed with crime, and the normal police aren't enough to stop it. The police force is bought out by a big corporation, Omni Consumer Products (O.C.P.), and they have new plans for the police force to stop the crime. Their answer? RoboCop. The performances here were excellent. Peter Weller was entertaining as Officer Murphy (RoboCop). Nancy Allen was good as Officer Lewis, Murphy's partner. Dan O'Herlihy was perfect as The Old Man, the owner of OCP. Ronny Cox was good as Dick Jones, the #2 person of OCP. Miguel Ferrer was great as Bob Morton, the OCP executive who creates RoboCop. And Kurtwood Smith was great as Clarence Boddicker, the unofficial \"crime boss' of Old Detroit. Besides great acting, there are great effects, costumes and props. Making this movie much MUCH more than a thin, no-plot action movie. RoboCop is very entertaining and should appeal to nearly all audiences. 9/10." "RoboCop was one of the first R rated movies I ever saw as a child. Back when they had this allure of being forbidden and dangerous. I'll freely admit I was much too young to catch its satire and a lot of the plot points flew right over my head. I was more affected (and to a degree traumatized) by its graphic violence and the horrible circumstances of Murphy's fate. But the film stuck with me. It was such a compelling character surrounded by equally interesting supporting characters. The villain gave me nightmares and I was flat out terrified of him. It was also one of the first movies with morally ambiguous individuals I'd ever seen. Until then the good guys were good and the bad guys were bad. But it wasn't that simple in RoboCop. And even at that young age that resonated with me. As I got older I began to appreciate the film on entirely other levels. And now, at 25 I love it even more. What we have here is something that could easily have turned into straight to video silliness. A mediocre script and laughable concept made into something revolutionary by great film-making. The lower points on Paul Verhoeven's resume can be forgiven because of gems like this. So many of the sequences in this film are just brilliantly shot and conceived (Murphy's death, the slow introduction to RoboCop, the Rock Shop bust, and the entire third act). He took subpar material and managed to shape it into so much more. But Verhoeven doesn't deserve all the credit. Peter Weller's performance is suitabaly repressed but somehow still so emotive. Not an easy task when all the audience sees is the lower half of your face. Kurtwood Smith takes corny and clichéd dialogue and makes it haunting and believable. The film has a down and dirty tone that no subsequent versions of the franchise have ever matched. There's beauty in its brutality and a cohesiveness sorely missing in the sequels. It feels epic and intimate at the same time. It's imaginative and awe inspiring. There were so many places to go with this character and so many possibilities. It's a shame the films and TV series that followed wasted all of them. Now the franchise inspires laughs and is all but dead. It's too bad because it's easy to forget how powerful and truly rock solid this first entry is." "In the near future of Detroit City. The major corporation \"OCP\" wants to built an Cyborg by making the perfect futuristic Police Officer. One day, Police Officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is killed on the line of duty by an ruthless gang of murdering/thieves (Lead by Kurtwood Smith). The \"OCP\" finds the perfect candidate by using several body parts of Murphy of their division. When \"OCP\" actually succeed by creating the perfect law enforcer and the cyborg is been called Robocop. Robocop becomes very successful with the public and the media, they think Robocop is the Ultimate Defender of Justice. Until the mind of Murphy has resurrected on Robocop and now taking personal revenge on the thugs, who murdered him. Directed by Paul Verhoeven (Black Book, Basic Instinct, Showgirls) made an thrilling, extremely well made violent film with plenty of action, humour, emotions and soul. Weller gives an solid believable performance as Murphy/Robocop in this instant classic film. The script is very clever and original as well. This film also stars Nancy Allen, Dan O'Herlihy, Miguel Ferrer, Ray Wise and Paul McCrane. Verhoeven's movie is an stylized cop-thriller.

"*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "i liked this movie quite a bit.it's very well paced,the acting is pretty good and it is ultra violent.it's basically about a part human,part cyborg cop who cleans up the streets of the city.there are some glitches along the way,of course.i think the movie,at its heart is a social satire.it's very relevant,even more so today.there are touches of irony and humour through out.Paul Verhoeven directed it and it's his first Americna movie.Verhoeven doesn't shy away from violence and if that sort of thing bothers you,you'll want to skip this movie.there is another,maybe more futuristic robotic cop,which i really like the look of.(possible minor spoiler ahead)there are two showdowns between RoboCop and this other futuristic,more advanced robot,both of which i found exciting and well done.for,me RoboCop is an 8/10" "I can't say that Paul Verhoeven is one of my favorite directors, but I have to admit that he definitely has a sense of humour. Robocop is a type of title that would make it sound like the dumbest thing on the planet or at the very least \"Diet Terminator\". Luckily the film is neither of these things. Robocop combines a rather standard action film with an interesting political message. A serious film is the best kind of satire and the various elements that make up the gritty tale of Robocop are what make it rather distinct in its B-film class. It is a violent film with a lot of heart. The 80s cheese-factor is noticeable in the film but luckily most of the film was shot very impressively and Robo himself only has a few moments of cheesy method-twitching. I was rather blown away by the quality of the stop-motion animation. In all Robocop is rather unusual film. It does not quite rise to the level of stand-out hits in the genre but is a notable film in its own right and definitely an enjoyable cinematic experience." "Robocop was a definite commercial success both in the United States and overseas. It has since become a classic example of the futurist genre alongside such great films as The Road Warrior, Blade Runner, and the much overlooked Charleton Heston classic Soylent Green. The thematic intertextuality of these films is clear, as they all deal in one way or another with issues such as overpopulation, the deterioration of the human lifestyle, consumerism and the corporation as the root of all evil. Robocop has earned it's place in popular culture as a prime example of its genre and has been nominated for Academy Awards in film editing and sound. Director Paul Verhoeven won the Saturn award in 1988 for his work on Robocop, and the film went on to receive more than a dozen awards and nominations including BAFTA and the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films. Robocop has become a classic meditation on the detritus of modernity, and reminds us not to lose our humanity in the rat race of the post industrial world." "This movie is both a reason not to lose hope in Hollywood, and at the same time painfully reminds us how tame, boring and stupid most of the action genre has become. Paul Verhoeven never used more efficiently the unparalleled resources Hollywood has to offer. With a decent - but not overblown - budget, he manages to show a spectacular display of action and great special effects that you can still watch today without laughing, unlike many other 80's movies. The story (a cop working in a corruption-ridden society is brutally murdered and turned into a robotic law enforcer) is fairly simple, and in other hands could've ended like many other childish action movies. But the satiric tone and the full-frontal violence not only validates the humor, but helps the audience to understand the social critic without hammering it down. It's a moral tale, but certainly not a lecture. The unbelievable boldness of the tone and the nifty execution turns this sci-fi/political pamphlet into a \"Clockwork Orange\"-like phenomenon. It's not aimed at kids, but if the brutality wasn't so over-the-top it should be shown to the youngest moviegoers, as the REAL action movie. No over-use of CGI. No annoying sidekick. No stupid humor or \"satisfactory\" ending. No compromise. The 21st century truly NEEDS a movie like this. Not a remake, or a reboot, or whatever fancy name the studios come up with. Just a new kind of no-nonsense, clever, ambitious big budget movies that doesn't insult the audience's intelligence for a change. To settle the score with subsequent shallow Hollywood flicks whose makers brag about carrying on RoboCop's legacy while reaching for the lowest common denominator (\"Iron Man\", anyone?). To set a new standard in blockbusters, an alternative to silly, brainwashing and heartless \"entertainment\". The sooner's the better." "*** This review may contain spoilers ***" "Saw this in the cinema and have seen it numerous of times since. Fantastic from second one with an incredible story and super cast. The story of how technology has created the ultimate Super Cop. Poor Alex Murphy is gunned down by scumbag criminals and is recreated into RoboCop. The city is overrun by criminals and the hope is that RoboCop can bring some order to chaos. Peter Weller puts on a fine performance as RoboCop as his memories creep back of who he is and of who 'killed' him. Action is brilliant and eye pleasing as much as is the bloodshed!! Kurtwood Smith puts on an excellent show as Clarence Bodicker, the main bad guy too. The whole story of vengeance and corruption is so well versed in this movie and will certainly please all! Watch the director's cut for a real treat if you've seen this! Such a shame about the multitude of follow ups though........"
